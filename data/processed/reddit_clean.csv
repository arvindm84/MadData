"Can we maybe not dump on rural Wisconsin? It's already started.  It's happened every election season.  ""Rural counties suck.""  ""Northeast Wisconin sucks.""  ""Red counties suck.""  And so on.

And I get it.  I really do.  1.2 million of the states voting Republicans live in these communities and they've been no end of political headache.

But you know who else lives out here?

1 million of the states voting Democrats.  2/3rds of the states voting Democrats.

We're out here.  We're out here every day.  We're out here putting up our Harris/Walz/Baldwin signs in our front yards while living next to a Trump supporter.  We're out here wearing our ""Celebrate Diversity"" shirts to the grocery store standing next in line to the MAGA hat wearing guy.  We're out here organizing pride events in a city that's never had them before.  We're at family gatherings going, ""Well actually..."" when our uncle goes into another anti-Biden rant.

We're trying our best.  It's tiring, but we're trying.  We try because we love our communities.  We want our little towns to be full of love and be a welcoming place to everyone.  We didn't just pack up and leave when things got tough.  We decided to stay and try to make it a better place.

So it really sucks when you fight the good fight, then log online and all you see is fellow Wisconsinites talking about how much of a craphole your town is.  How we're all nothing but bigots.

It doesn't help.

Maybe try having our backs instead?  I'd really appreciate you for it.

Brad in Green Bay A fundraiser for Brad Schimel hosted by Tony Wied drew over three hundred protesters to the sidewalk in front of the restaurant in Suamico.

In the prayer they asked for salvation from the devil who was out on the sidewalk.  Our MAGA candidates evidently believe democracy is the devil.

"Starbucks Strike Just finished talking with the striking baristas at the Starbucks capitol square location. The company is attempting to enforce a new national dress code that, among other things, prohibits multiple body piercings. The company is attempting to enforce this change without following its legally required bargaining process with the Starbucks union. Many of the capitol location's employees are having their employment threatened by the announcement of this change which was made late on Sunday night and can ONLY be implemented via bargaining with the union (again, something the company has not yet done).

"DAY 34: ERIC BOLL MISSING SINCE AUGUST 23, 2024 From Madison WI

REWARD $12,000 for any tip leading us to finding Eric. 

FACTS
Aug 24
-Eric reported missing at 7:15 am by his wife
-reported to have been gone at 3 pm Aug 23 when she returned from work
-due to things he had taken and a previous recent incident felt he is a danger to himself 
-deemed missing and endangered 
-cell pinged unsuccessfully 

Sept 4
-family notified by detective in charge
-first public notification done at the family’s request 

Sept 5 - current 
-Eric’s family and our families friends start and continue search for Eric
-poster are put up all over Madison
-flyers distributed in his neighborhood looking for private footage of him leaving 
-multiple requests to engage Rapid Search and Rescue are denied. 

Sept 12
-parents had his cell service turned back on.  We found out the day before it was off due to nonpayment of the bill. 
-ping to cell showed it powered down. 

UPDATE 
Our searches yesterday again found nothing.   You come back relieved you didn’t find him in the woods and terrified you will never find him.   It is emotionally exhausting.   Steve continuously looks at the map and works to decide our next area of search.  

Today I am both sad and angry.  Most of all we are determined.  

Eric is listed as Missing and Endangered.   His alert went out only regionally.  This means not everyone who subscribes to that notification in the state got it.  We were told that was “a command decision and will not change”.  

I continue to wonder how this would be playing out if the person missing was the child of the police chief or any of the people listed below.   Do I sound angry?  I am very angry.   This is 34 days.  34.  We could be doing so much more and the City Of Madison police leadership refuse to bring them in.  Be clear that we appreciate all that the officers have been doing to find our son.  We also appreciate the caring and compassion of every officer in the field we have come into contact with during this horrible journey. 

We NEED Rapid Search and Rescue.   The resources and experience they have are far superior to our small efforts.  They are experts at search and rescue efforts and have the teams of resources we just can’t gather.  I am floored we are having to BEG to bring in these resources.  

We were told he left on a bike and hasn’t gone far.  He left on an e-bike with a 50-60 mile range.   He could be miles away from Madison and COULD have even crossed state lines.  The searches have been extensive.  Nothing found.  We were told the city won’t take the liability for brining in the search teams.   How is the city of madison different than any other department in the state that has used Rapid Search and Rescue.   They are trained, licensed and insured.  Certified with the state. 

These are the searches that Rapid Search and Rescue have participated in this year.   Elija Vue in Two Rivers, Leya Stewart in Jeneua County, Sade Robinson Milwaukee, Gerrit Pully Milwaukee, Tarion Johnson, Milwaukee. 

WHY WON’T CITY of Madison pull them in?   

Sheriff Kalvin Barrett you have jurisdiction to do so as well.  HELP us get the help we need to find our son.  

CALL TO ACTION

-Call Governer Tony Evers office and ask for Rapid Search and Rescue to be brought in.  
-Call senator Tammy Baldwins office and ask the same. 
-Call Sheriff Kalvin Barrett and request the same. 

Please pray for us and most importantly pray for Eric.  We are here son and won’t give up until we find you!

"My family has owned apartments in the area for decades, we have had the inspector called on us for a few very minor details by a handful of disgruntled tenants (door rubbing, a screw an inch too short on a latch, etc,), they mean business and made sure we corrected these minor details. This is NOT a minor detail, a sparking outlet anywhere can cause a fire which could KILL people, an outlet in a goddamn shower, that doesn't have a working ground fault interrupter, let alone sparks when you touch it is almost close to unbelievable. I would first contact the Tenant Resource Center for guidance but you NEED to also involve the city inspector ASAP, who knows what other dangerous DIY ""work"" has been done in that building and it needs to be inspected top to bottom so that we aren't reading about a deadly fire or carbon monoxide leak some day. That wiring was not done by an electrician they would lose their license for that. My other advice would be to stop corresponding with your landlord directly, have the inspector deal with him, or if the tenant resource center can find you an attorney to help even better. He may try to retaliate and threaten to evict you or whatever but in this instance you have all of the leverage and are likely entitled to rent abatement until it is corrected, he may not want to renew your lease next year but it is inked until then and it would be a breach on his end to mess with it.

"Sign the Petition - Restore Recess to Wisconsin Schools! Hello everyone! 

I, along with a team of parents, are working to expand recess in our public elementary and middle schools. Our organization, Say Yes to Recess, thinks that 30 minutes a day just isn't enough. 

60 minutes of outside play a day is correlated with all sorts of great health benefits for kids: 

* It can reduce childhood obesity
* It significantly helps with emotional regulation, leading to less misbehaviors in the classroom 
* It promotes social-emotional learning, such as cooperation with their peers 
* It helps with children's mental health, like reducing rates of stress and depression

Our goal is to change the laws regarding recess in Wisconsin. Right now, there is no explicit minimum amount of time schools must schedule for recess. We want to change that to a mandated 60 minutes a day. 

In order to get a state representative to help us, we need to show that there is community support for this cause. YOU can help RIGHT NOW by signing our petition on change,org.

1. By far the question asked most was about my location as well as many commenters telling me that I needed to move over or get out of the left lane. 

-I was on a narrow-lane rural road. I couldn’t move over and they couldn’t pass me. The speed limit is 45 mostly and, 25 on the section in town. 
 
-As for those saying move over, I generally agree with this as I try to be non-confrontational with other drivers. Safety is more important than being right.

-The left lane, I agree that no one should stay in the left lane with the exception of carpool lanes and the left lane exit, it’s a passing lane, not a cruising lane and you cannot be surprised if someone suddenly is up on your ass.

Walk down lakeshore path or state street, go to memorial union, bring your favorite board game, bring your guitar, skateboard your way downtown, stand absolutely still like youre one of the statues only to reveal you're alive a whole hour later! If you start up some good conversations with someone, you can always have a cute little first date at a restaurant, chocolate shop, coffee shop, bar, whatever tickles your fancy. 

So I guess this has taken a liking to my Madisonian friends! Dress how you please, but please make yourself known. Everyone deserves to feel safe in their city, please be respectful of everyone, everyone loves and lives differently ❤️ 

T-shirt colors label how you're looking? 
Green- actively looking and hoping to find something
Yellow- passively waiting for a soul mate to reveal themself
Red- not really looking at all, but if something happens, cool
Wear what makes you happy, but let it be known who you are, and what kind of partner you're looking for

If we get a good number of people that show up (I'm talking 150+) imma have to grab a picture.... I'll stand in front of the church taking a pic directly down state street of the capital at 5:15PM sharp!

If nothing else, come take a walk and keep that heart healthy for that future special someone.

Oh, and please only bring respect. Everyone has their own preferences, and if you don't fit them, ya DONT. FIT. THEM.! Move on to the next fishy🐟

"I stopped using Walgreens in 2022. We don’t use them often as we have been lucky with good health (family of 5).

In 2022 I came back from an international trip with travelers’ diarrhea. 🥲 It was brutal, and it wasn’t getting better, so finally at 7am on a Sunday morning I was prescribed antibiotics and anti nausea meds. They got sent to the Walgreens on Maple Grove, which was going to be open until 2pm.

At noon, while still stuck to the toilet, I tried calling to see if it would be ready that day. Cool if not, I know they’re busy, but if not then I needed the prescription transferred to the 24-hr location. I needed the meds that day. I called 4 separate times over the span of an hour, and nobody answered the phone. So I finally peeled myself off the toilet and went there in person. The med tech looked surprised, and said “oh, you want this today??” when I asked about the status of my prescription. Uh…. Yes??? Antibiotics, yes I need them today, like wtf. They ended up filling it, but that was the last time I ever used them.

Fast forward to 2023. I had a raging ear infection. Got seen at the end of the clinic day and was prescribed antibiotics. Had them sent to Fitchburg Family Pharmacy. I got a personal phone call from Thad because the pharmacy was closing soon, but if I couldn’t get there before they closed he would deliver them to my house.

"PSA on Chapter, live somewhere else I'm just very done with this place and want to make sure some freshmans that don't know any better avoid sign with these guys so let me rant off some issues for a bit

1) This entire place was built with a single goal in mind, to be as cheap as humanly possible without constantly falling apart. It's barely been a month since we've been here and we've had to put in multiple maintenance requests for everything from a broken dryer to improperly installed doors and cabinets. I'm not sure about the response times right now but maintenance took over a week to fix some of our problems with us having to pester management till they fixed our dryer while we had wet clothes laying around. The ""wood-style flooring"" is just a nice way of saying extremely cheap vinyl that'll permanently stain if you look at it wrong which is exactly what happened the second we spilled spilledon the kitchen floor. Also in the kitchen I want to quickly mention the genuine quartz countertops that are genuinely the worst quartz anything I've seen. This is on top of not having promised amenities like a ceiling fan in the bedrooms and one of my roommates missing some furniture that was supposed to be in all of our rooms the moment we got here plus all the unfinished concrete ""accents"" being properly filthy with chalk, paint, water marks, and some outdoor gunk for good measure just being stuck to it. This is advertised as being ""luxury"" btw

2) The WiFi issues. I was already plenty upset when the first week of school came around and I had to blow through my phone's data plan cause their backup wifi couldn't even load canvas and, at least from what they told us, they were only having issues since move in day. Then I later found out that the building was supposed to have working full speed wifi a month and a half before move in but they kept lying through their teeth talking about how oh AT&amp;T's doing some maintenance on w/e and the wifi will work just fine tomorrow we promise ;). It took closer to 14 tomorrows for it to finally kick back in but the best part was it started working the same day someone I met here got a wifi hotspot from management and was supposed to return it the same day by 5pm which they couldn't do and were kindly charged an arm and a leg for it by management instead of giving at least a full day's notice as a basic human courtesy

3) The scummy contract. Yes I know pretty much all contracts given to you aren't for your own good but this one's just a special breed of awful as you get to pay 12 whole payments to them for an 11 month contract IF you choose not to resign by September 23rd or pray that someone doesn't snatch your room from you the next day or you want to swap rooms. Regardless, if you just don't want to resign by the rediculous deadline or want to switch to another room in your own apartment well you're gunna have to pay a couple hundred bucks for that. Now god forbid you don't want to pay that then **your lease ends in mid July** while virtually all other campus housing has their lease starting some time in August. They're intentionally putting pressure on anyone renting here to keep renting by doing this or else you risk going weeks of being homeless in Madison which wouldn't be as bad if this place didn't heavily cater to international and out of state students which would have a much harder time with taking their stuff back home if they don't have a friend with enough space to hold onto it

4) The package system. God it's infuriating to know that I'm in some way paying for this garbage luxer package pickup thing when in the first few weeks the entire thing didn't work and they kept the package room door open for the entire day then just closed it at 6pm. You got home late and needed that package before 10am the next day? Well good luck bucko you're waiting for them to come and open it the next day. But now the issue's solved I thought cause we can just unlock the door when we get a package at any time yay but no cause that assumes the delivery drivers scan all the packages and put in our information, which they don't, and you cannot open the door unless you beg someone at the front desk to do it for you which is again, only till 6pm. Plus after hours all your packages will just be left outside so hope it's nothing important

Okay now that I feel better typing this out instead of writing an actual hw essay, I'd love to mention again that you should avoid this place full stop. If all that wasn't enough for you, they've decided to raise rates across the board for this year and our 'current resident lowest pricing' or w/e was still more than what we paid while signing pretty late last year. They said it was through some careful observations of the property market but no this is a flat out lie and they were expecting the prices to go up when a leasing agent let it slip during december of last year.

I can’t really speak to any of the hearing back after an interview/trial shift but after my (only one, they don’t schedule a second interview) interview and subsequent trial shift, they were very upfront about their current staffing needs and when I could expect to hear an update. They do pay for a meal after your trial shift. You do taste all of the food and drink if you’re going to be in a position where discussing those details with guests is part of your responsibilities. Training for a lead captain position is about 25 hours in sum and bartending is about 50 so I’m unsure where you got your estimation. While yes you get paid 10$/hour, what restaurant worth their salt is going to pay someone 30$+/hour to train? 

The only people who didn’t have a job at the end of the entire training process were those who didn’t bother to learn the basic necessities of the role. Why, after multiple shifts where you still don’t know basic, necessary information about the food or beverage we offer, would we want you a part of the team when you aren’t showing any sort of motivation to learn the position? Imagine any other industry where someone had all of the requisite information handed to them and they ignored it - would they still have a job? Why should the service industry be any different? You would think turning down other jobs would’ve motivated them more.

"Finding Madison's Best Bench (04) - Bozho's Lookout **Where:**

San Damiano Park

Monona, WI

https://preview.redd.it/fihosnojbbbd1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7d4458b7491f044bcd3fd2e88838339f51c06f3

|The Details|
|:-|
|Sun exposure:|Squinting will ensue|
|Parking:|Free but limited|
|Wind conditions:|Could easily blow out birthday candles|
|Accessibility:|Short walk or quick tumble down grass steps|

**About:**

Hi, it's been a while. After u/donnian called me out for abandoning my post, I figured it was time for another bench review.

This time, I visited San Damiano Park in Monona. It's a small, historic park tucked away off Monona Drive on Lake Monona. The property was part of a 600-acre cattle farm developed by Frank Allis in the 1890s. The house on the property was the first year-round residence on Lake Monona. The property is full of cedars, sycamores, oaks, pines and apple trees.

The park's entrance is easy to miss, so be on the lookout for the small sign guiding you down a narrow drive that looks more like a sidewalk than a road.

Our featured bench is tucked away out of view and set on a stone platform carved into a bluff just above the water. Wander the park's edge and you'll find it.

Here's the breakdown.

**Pros:**

* The stones and lush greenery give poor man Tuscan vibes, which I'm here for
* Superb, panoramic sunset views will put your living room walls to shame
* The peaceful setting forces you to finally confront your deepest thoughts

**Cons:**

* You can't go inside the home because you can't be trusted, but you can take a [3D tour ](https://www.sandamianomonona.org/property?tab=target-tab-4#about-property-section)
* You'll be constantly reminded that you don't own a boat
* The strong lake breeze will eventually give you Trump hair

**It’s a great bench for...**

* Pretending you're the wealthy owner of a historic lake home
* Eavesdropping on park visitors oblivious of your presence
* Scanning the waters for Bozho, Madison's legendary sea serpent

**Final thoughts:**

This bench has it all. It's private, directly on the water and surrounded by trees, birds and history. It features excellent views of Lake Monona and downtown Madison, and is the perfect spot for a quick lunch break or weekend bike trek.

This Thursday, July 11, there's a free Biergartens event at the park with drinks, live music and food carts. A 19-piece jazz band will be playing, which feels like too many pieces but you'll just have to show up to find out.

It was revealed to my partner and I after we moved out of our rental house and into our first home (s/o East Side) via a Christmas gift this year who our Bean Bandit(s) was. A single wrapped can of Bushes Baked Beans under the tree from my brother and his girlfriend.

My brother and his girlfriend who lived 8 houses down the street from our rental property, planted mini cans of beans on their midnight walks or random times they thought we weren’t around. Picking up small, obscure types of mini bean cans when they went to the grocery store.

My partner and I had grilled them with questions, convinced it had to be the two of them, but call me the naive older sister, I fell for the lies! To keep us off their tracks, they even garnered the help of a mutual friend to plant a can while they were out of town.

I took a closer look and realized that nearly every building in the background has been built since the '90s. La Ville is in the middle, and I think that's coming down soon. Witte Hall is at the far right. And there are some older 3-story buildings along Frances/Gilman that are historic.

But I count at least 12 in this shot alone that are 21st century buildings, if not since 2010. It's a vastly different place from when I first got here in 1988 and you could see just about all of downtown from Bascom Hill.

Edit: Yeah... I got here in 1988, not 2010. I = old.",reddit,downtown
"Some Winnebago County supervisors vote against accepting grant funds Voters in April elected 13 new supervisors to the Winnebago County Board’s 36 seats, but the current board continues to grapple with the same challenge as the previous: accepting grant funds.

The issue has surfaced multiple times during county board meetings dating back to 2021, prompting concern about whether supervisors are voting based on personal beliefs rather than what’s best for the county.

A grant is a financial award that typically does not require repayment and is provided for a specific purpose. An application process is required to be considered, which often involves submitting detailed proposals within a set deadline. Grants may be competitive, with some organizations receiving more applications than can be funded.

A resolution is required for the county to accept grant funds, with a two-thirds majority vote to pass, a threshold the board has found challenging to meet. 

In 2021 and 2022, some supervisors voted against accepting two disbursements of a grant totaling $33 million from the federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). Despite opposition, the final votes allowed the county board to accept the funds, which are now being used to improve infrastructure and fund social welfare programs countywide. 

More recently, it took the county board about 10 months to accept an $80,000 grant awarded to the Winnebago County Health Department to fund harm reduction vending machines in Neenah and Oshkosh stocked with the overdose-reversing medication Narcan. 

Initially, the board voted against accepting the grant, with some supervisors vocal in their belief that Narcan encourages drug use – a myth that Health Director Doug Gieryn dispelled. The resolution to accept the money was brought back to the board for a second vote in March and passed by a narrow margin of 24-7. 

At the county board meeting last month, a total of $141,200 in grant funds were available to the Health Department to provide free or low-cost vaccines to children, adolescents and adults who are uninsured or underinsured, particularly in medically underserved and marginalized communities.

Supervisor Kate Hancock-Cooke, who was newly elected in April, implied that political agendas may be overshadowing the needs of constituents and questioned why grants for some departments pass with little debate, while grants for the Health Department are challenged.

“I think grant funding is more scrutinized when the beneficiary is the public Health Department than other groups that have sought and easily and readily received grant funding,” she said, citing the Winnebago Sheriff's Office, which was approved for $180,000 in grants in May to fund jail inmate drug treatment programs. 

The June 18 vote on whether to accept grant funds for the Health Department sparked an hourlong debate, with opposition driven by broader beliefs opposing vaccines and government mandates.

Supervisor Conley Hanson introduced a motion to postpone voting on accepting the grant funds, citing ongoing lawsuits and a World Council for Health statement recommending a “common sense approach” to vaccinations.

“I do believe that it is advisable to pause – I’m not saying reject, to pause – and see how this starts playing out so that any monies or messaging reflects any new case law, emerging medical and scientific opinions,” he said.

Hancock-Cooke, who retired from Kimberly-Clark in 2018 as a senior research scientist, told the Oshkosh Herald that the World Council for Health should not be confused with the World Health Organization, the former being a deceptively named organization that spreads misinformation to discourage COVID-19 vaccination.

An Oshkosh Media video recording of the county board meeting was subsequently flagged by YouTube as containing topics prone to misinformation and includes a link to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web page with information on the COVID-19 vaccine.

Gieryn said one of the grants amounting to $40,000 had a competitive application process and postponing acceptance could cause the county to lose the money.

“The intent of these funds is to address routine immunizations, so this is not related to COVID vaccinations,” he said.

Upon questioning, Gieryn conceded that if a new COVID-19 vaccine is developed, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services could consider it a routine vaccination in the future.

Supervisor Karen Powers discouraged her colleagues from targeting certain vaccines that could one day be considered routine.

“You know, we could have a man on the moon vaccine but we don’t want to discard measles, mumps, rubella, and diphtheria, and pertussis, and all those shots that our babies need, and vote against postponing,” she said.

Supervisor Morris Cox called the grant “free money,” which prompted Supervisor Tim O'Brien to respond, “There is no free money; I mean, the road to big government is paved with free money.” 

The supervisors voted against postponing the vote on accepting the grant funds, after which supervisor Don Nussbaum, without providing evidence, said the Health Department previously went to Oakwood Elementary and injected experimental vaccine “death jabs” into children that turned out to be harmful. 

“In August 2019 the Board of Health was up here trying to talk us into agreeing to mandatory vaccines, they wanted to take away parents’ rights to be able to not vaccinate their children,” he said.

Gieryn said the grant funds will deal with declining vaccination rates that will lead to more disease and asked for the supervisors’ support for the health of the community.

“These are routine immunizations that have been proven safe over decades of use and they’re voluntary,” he said.

He later repeated that all vaccinations are voluntary and no one is forced to take a vaccination.

Supervisor Rachael Dowling said she’s voting against the grants based on her own personal religious convictions, noting that she gives her children “alternative brands” of vaccines that aren’t offered through the grant program.

Supervisors who supported the grants argued for acceptance, emphasizing the benefits to public health and county residents who may otherwise be unable to access vaccinations. 

Supervisor Tim Paterson said that he doesn’t feel it’s government’s role to order people to take vaccines, “but I also think that it’s incorrect to deny them of people, as well, and I will be voting for this because I think some of these people that are pro-vaccine should have the opportunity to have it.”

The two resolutions to accept the grant funds narrowly passed with votes of 24-10 with two abstentions and 24-11 with one abstention.

"FRJ (fact-check Ron Johnson) March 6th town hall I’ve listened to Ron Johnson’s last two telephone town halls and found myself disappointed by his outright lies and misdirection (even though I should know better). Rather than shouting into the void that is Johnson’s attention to his constituents, I’m going to try writing up a summary of the things he said during his town hall that could use correction. I’m quite disillusioned with our ability to hold our elected representatives accountable, or to effect change ourselves. I’m doing this because it feels cathartic to rant to like-minded people, and out of (probably delusional) hope that relentlessly calling out our representatives might influence them to work for us or influence others to think twice about reelecting them.  

 

I’m doing this after listening without taking notes this time, so I apologize for only addressing a few things from today’s town hall. If anyone finds this useful, I will make notes during future town halls and do this more thoroughly.

 

Senator Johnson’s favorite line seems to be “we have a spending problem, not a revenue problem.” He uses it to justify the government cuts Trump and DOGE are attempting, and to argue for decreased spending through Congressional appropriations. Callers during both town halls have asked why he doesn’t want to increase tax rates for the wealthiest Americans to fund our current spending levels, rather than hurt the poorest Americans by cutting government services. Senator Johnson deflects these questions by stating the top 1% of income earners pay a higher rate of income taxes than the average American. This is a red herring. The wealthiest Americans do not earn the majority of their wealth through income, so the majority of their wealth is not taxed. As callers have rightly pointed out, the wealthiest Americans enjoy government subsidies in the form of welfare for their lowest paid employees, but do not pay a tax rate proportional to their benefit from government services. 

 

Some questions for Senator Johnson related to income tax, in case his staff is on Reddit: 

Why not create a tax structure that actually forces the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share, or to incentivize them to pay employees enough that fewer need to rely on Medicaid. Some suggestions for how to do so. 1) Tax wealth instead of income. The wealthiest Americans enjoy untaxed ways of accruing wealth that people at lower income levels do not have access to. The wealthiest are also able to leverage their wealth to further enrich themselves; see the stock market, money in politics, Elon Musk buying himself a de facto presidency. 2) Create a corporate tax that taxes corporations proportional to their number of employees who qualify for federal welfare programs based on income. Low federal and state minimum wages have allowed corporations to subsidize their payroll by allowing the government to pay for employee health care and food stamps. Corporations should not be able to hold wages low and increase profits in a way that relies on government subsidies to keep their employees fed and with access to health care.  

 

Johnson wants to do away with Medicaid expansion. A caller made a point about the income limits for people to be on Medicaid, even in expansion states. The individual income limit is just over $15k for an individual and just over $25K for a family of three. It is unconscionable that Senator Johnson would rather end Medicaid for people under those income limits rather than find a way to raise taxes on the most wealthy individuals.  

Related to the Medicaid expansion point. That caller’s question was asking Senator Johnson to state plainly whether he would vote no on any bill that sought to cut Medicaid, Medicare, or Social Security. The most plain response Johnson provided was that he cannot make such blanket guarantees. 

 

A caller asked about RFK and MAHA. The caller was misinformed about dye bans that happened under Biden, and attributed them to RFK. Senator Johnson used this caller’s question about when RFK will make food safer to proselytize about bringing integrity back to science. This one hits close to home for me, because I am a scientist. I won’t say much about this aside from pointing out that the entire enterprise of science is built to maintain integrity, from the scientific method to the process of peer review before studies are published. Just like everywhere, bad incentives give bad actors excuses to commit fraud, but as a whole, science has been excellent at preventing and discovering fraud. See [retractionwatch](https://retractionwatch.com/) for a small glimpse into how scientists hold themselves and others accountable.  

 

That’s all for this edition of FRJ (fact-check Ron Johnson). Like I said, if anyone find this useful, I’ll make notes during future town halls so my write-up can be more thorough.",reddit,general madison

Are they slightly in the wrong for asking for your license, rather than ID?  Yes.

"Most charming tows in Madison area Rank the most charming small towns in the Madison area. Rules are they must be within 45 minutes drive of the far edges of Madison (this means Baraboo, Spring Green, Mineral Point, Monroe, Watertown, Beaver Dam, and Portage are all fair game). Rankings are meant to be fun and promote tourism, not competitive, so don’t be a jerk if you have a difference of opinion from someone.

Here’s my top 15, in reverse order.

15 Monroe—Drastically underrated outside of the courthouse square, which is the prettiest one in Wisconsin. Good culinary tasting opportunities at Alp &amp; Dell and Minhas brewery/distillery.

14 Watertown—It can feel a touch run down and creepy sometimes, but that’s part of the charm. The park and cemetery land has a unique vibe, the Octagon House is a masterpiece, and Clyman Street architecture is underappreciated.

13 Portage–Some nice residential neighborhoods, but the downtown commercial triangle makes this city special. Historical sites are among the oldest buildings in Wisconsin. Portage Asian cuisine is among the best sushi in the entire state, rivaling anything in the big cities.

12 Cambridge—One of the most charming Main Streets in Southern Wisconsin, as one of the most charming lakeside cemeteries in the area. Mark my words, this will become prime development territory within the next couple decades, so enjoy it while it is quaint.

11 Sauk City—Maybe the best grand entrance into town (across the Wisconsin River on Highway 12). The whole Sauk Prairie area must be considered when evaluating charm; houses are cooler in Prairie du Sac, but more cool historic buildings in Sauk City (Freethinkers Hall, Fire Station, commercial buildings). Ferry Bluff is a hidden gem. Two of the best and most atmospheric supper clubs in the region (Dorf Haus and Green Acres)

10 Lodi —When residential areas are taken into consideration, one of the best preserved and maintained towns in the area. More people should do walking tours and see Lodi’s Queen Anne houses, which are some of the best small town Queen Annes in Wisconsin. Lake Wisconsin and the Merrimac Ferry may technically be outside of town, but they are truly a part of Lodi’s charm, as is the natural beauty surrounding the buildings in town. Lodi is the de facto beginning of the Wisconsin Scenic Byway 60, and Gibraltar Rock is one of the most beautiful lookouts in Southern Wisconsin.

9 Mount Horeb —The Trollway and old opera block make for one of Wisconsin’s cutest Main Streets. Nearby Cave of the Mounds is a worthy signature attraction, and Stewart Lake and the nearby backroads by Tyrol Basin that mark the true edge of the foothills of the Driftless Area are a hidden gem.

8 Stoughton —Janesville may have more contiguous historic districts, but Stoughton comes close. The opera house is one of the most stunning buildings in Dane County, and the Victorian houses are fairly well maintained by and large. The Main Street maintains its charm for miles.

7 Lake Mills—It’s hard to put a finger on why Lake Mills is so charming. No one feature outshines other towns in the area, save maybe the lake itself. But it has a peaceful vibe, and the Fargo Mansion and Library are local architectural masterpieces.

6 Evansville—The single most underrated town in Southern Wisconsin in terms of charm, in my opinion. Commercial area needs a few more offerings but the brick Main Street is adorable. The Victorian architecture is impeccably preserved and offers examples of virtually every major 19th and early 20th century American style, including one of the most important architectural intersections in Wisconsin, according to the State Historical Society (First and Main, with its Claude &amp; Starck Prairie Library as well as houses in the Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, and High Victorian Queen Anne styles). The former girls’ school is stunning. Man made Lake Leota is beautiful and the park contains depression era architecture. Maple Hill cemetery is the burial site of American impressionist painter Theodore Robinson, and the towering Eager monument is one of only 3 individual tombstones on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin.

5 Columbus—This town has so much charm they used it for scenes in the film Public Enemies. It has everything you want in a small town, architecturally speaking: a grandiose signature building (the Richardsonian Romanesque City Hall), an internationally respected architectural masterpiece (the Louis Sullivan jewel box Farmers &amp; Merchants bank, a National Historic Landmark), an original Frank Lloyd Wright residence, a spectacularly charming Main Street (in this case, James Street), and some of the most well preserved residential Victorian architecture in the state (centered around Prairie Street, maybe my favorite residential street in Southern Wisconsin). The Columbus Antique Mall may not be much from the outside, but the inside is expansive and worthy of the title of biggest antique mall in the state.

4 New Glarus—Touristy or not, there is no denying that New Glarus is oozing visual charm. If this were a contest for the single most charming block in Wisconsin, then 1st St between 5th and 6th Aves would definitely be a contender, with its Swiss chalet style shops and restaurants and stunning view of an early 20th century church that serves as the visual focal point of the downtown. The brewery is free and fun to tour.

3 Spring Green—The charm here isn’t from European style architecture, but from the overall ambience of a town that produced 3 world class entertainment experiences: Taliesin, House on the Rock, and American Players Theater. In addition to this unique modern architecture, the natural setting along scenic byway 60 is stunning, with the Wisconsin River and Tower Hill State Park offering fun glimpses of nature. Nearby Plain is home to St Anne’s chapel, which is a true hidden gem, if a difficult hike.

2 Baraboo—If small town architecture, entertainment opportunities, and surrounding natural areas that are technically outside city limits are all taken into account, Baraboo is probably number one. Nothing beats the Devil’s Lake/Parfrey’s Glen/Pewitt’s Nest Power combo for natural excursions, and if you include Dr Evermor’s Forevertron and the Railroad Museum, the greater Baraboo area is unbeatable. In terms of urban landscape, the courthouse square is second only to Monroe for charm (the shops are fantastic). The circus legacy makes for a fun landscape with multiple entertainment opportunities, including Circus World, a house museum/brewery combo, a B&amp;B, and what is unquestionably one of the top three most beautiful theaters in the state. There’s a beautiful cemetery with some celebrity mausoleums (Ringling Bros), a signature work of art tombstone (the Belgian-sculpted Alta Belle Hopkins grave, in need of some repair funds for its cracking base), and several excellent treestump tombstones. The Gothic Catholic Church has unique stained glass, and the zoo is cute. I’ll dock the city a few points for an ungly area near Highway 12 (but add points for the circus designs on the highway overpass)

1 Mineral Point—This town makes pretty much every single “most charming towns in the Midwest” list I’ve ever found on the internet. One of the earliest efforts at historic preservation in the state as well as one of its top 5 oldest towns, virtually the entire town is on the National Register of Historic Places while being surrounded by the dramatic hills of the Driftless Area. The architectural beauty is a little more subtle than some of the towns on this list, but what it lacks in ostentatiousness, it makes up for in authenticity and an overall vibe that is heavily influenced by its reputation as an artistic community. Pendarvis &amp; Shakerag Alley combine for a 1-2 punch that celebrates past and present culture, and there are several stately architectural examples including Orchard Lawn and the Opera House. The pioneer cemetery was recently restored through a town-wide preservation project, while Graceland Cemetery contains the tombstone of a celebrity (Betty White’s former husband, Password Host Alan Ludden). There is a local food scene centered on traditional Cornish foods (pasties, foggyhobbin) and Hook’s Cheese, which might make the best long-aged cheddar in all of Wisconsin.",reddit,downtown

I went with some relatives to visit him last Christmas and it was a surreal and stressful experience. The place is medieval. There’s an almost comical amount of metal slamming noises and buzzers and shit going off constantly — almost like they’re pumping a prison sound fx loop in on speakers.

The staff are absolutely miserable and simultaneously power-tripping. Visitors are sort of treated like short-term inmates as if they should get a little punishment for being related. There’s all this crazy security theater, then you have to walk through this ridiculous gauntlet of hallways and doors that seems designed to intimidate and humiliate you. (At one point, they had us go the opposite way of where we ultimately needed to go so they could send us through an outdoor corridor that I think leads to the rec yard with guards with long-guns standing around just to make us feel terrified.)

Then we get to the visitor cafeteria and my cousin comes out and you can sit at a table and talk. There’s a shitty vending machine if you want to share a terrible snack. After a while, my cousin’s like, “do you guys want to get a Christmas photo?” I look over and there’s the saddest fucking fake little Christmas tree by itself against the white concrete wall. 

“Sh-sure.. let’s do it…!”

He calls to some other inmate working there named Mark and tells him to get the camera for a photo. While this guy gets the camera, my uncle (cousin’s dad) asks him “so, what’s Mark in here for?”

My cousin looks over and nonchalantly says “he murdered both of his parents up north in their sleep.”

We crowd around the shit Christmas tree and eek out the most scared smiles ever as this murderer takes our photo with a digital camera that looked 20 years old. The tree is barely in the photo and it’s all crooked and poorly composed. We pass it around and have a laugh about it at get togethers now.

-going inside the capitol, even though it all looks the same it always felt so peaceful in there. also the dome observation deck and museum (was there so many times the security guy recognized me, lol)

-a decent bus system, I barely had to drive when going around UW campus/downtown areas. The city I moved to is much bigger than madison but you 110% need a car even in the center

-badger games in the student section! not even a huge football person but there is nothing quite like Jumping Around along with \~80k other people in different drunkenness levels

"&gt;you should come back to this comment and tell how you fixed this 

In my case the City of Madison Clerk's Office did acknowledge issues with the automated absentee ballot printing and mailing equipment and took down my name and birthdate to add to their list of errors. All the serial numbers and other info on both the absentee packets I received were identical, so they advised me to destroy the duplicate and submit one ballot. The return address and postage was printed correctly on mine.

My partner also received two indentical ballots so I provided their info as well. Between the two of us we received four separate packets today.

As much as it pains me to conclude this, there *are* issues with this election; this is exctly the type of ineptitude I was afraid of. The viability of democracy hangs in the balance and this is how it's going.

For Immediate Release
September 23, 2024

The Madison Clerk’s Office is rectifying a data processing error that caused duplicate absentee ballots to be sent to around 2,000 voters. The error affected only voters in one ward and was quickly caught and corrected so that it will not affect any other ballots going forward.  

The Clerk’s office has been contacting voters individually to inform them of the error, caution them to submit only one ballot, and to destroy the second one to avoid any confusion. Because the duplicate ballots have identical barcodes, in the unlikely event that a voter submits two absentee ballots, only one can be counted. Once that barcode is scanned, the voting system does not allow a ballot with the same barcode to be submitted. The voter is also marked in the poll book as having voted absentee, which is another safeguard against voters accidentally submitting two ballots.",reddit,general madison

"I am not Chinese. I lived in China for years, I can speak Chinese, and my wife is Chinese. I would say for the size of Madison, the Chinese food is about as good as it is going to get. It is of course nothing like Chinatown in Chicago, San Francisco, Francisco, or NYC, but we shouldn’t expect Madison to be comparable to large international cities in the US.

I lived in North China, so I don’t know much about Cantonese food. You can get some dim sum at Nani. The rest of their dishes are just ok. 

I’ve eaten hot pot hundreds of times in China. Fuki Hot Pot has hot pot that is pretty close to what I got in China. I’ve also been to Double 10 Hot Pot. While I didn’t eat hot pot there, the restaurant has several authentic dishes from Northeast China. It is rare to find Northeastern Chinese food in the US, even in large cities. I 

Ichiban is alright. Some of the dishes are really Americanized, while others are close to authentic. The 烤鱼 there is quite good. I think it is listed as Koi Fish hot pot or something like that. It isn’t hot pot though. The 麻辣香锅 there is decent. That is a really spicy type of stir fry.

There are a few places to get food from Yunnan like 过桥米线 like Dagu Rice Noodles and one of the places in Global Market. I haven’t tried Dagu, so I don’t know if it is any good.

Lastly, there is even a Tibetan restaurant in Madison. I can’t speak to its authenticity. I’ve only been to the province next to Tibet, which actually has a lot of Tibetan people.

Given all these options, as well as the numerous Chinese grocery stores, I would say the Chinese food is good for a city of 300,000 people in the Midwest. I bet you would struggle to find a similar sized Midwestern city with these options. The only other small city I’ve been to with decent Chinese options was Champaign-Urbana.",reddit,general madison

"The Future of DEI Throwaway for obvious reasons. Apparently multiple directors of DEl offices across campus were called into meetings with senior leaders after the diversity forum with the same message: UW Madison will be disarming and reimagining DEl work completely at the university. They already fired the director of the GSCC without cause and banned per from campus as well as are preventing employees and students from holding processing space to get support following the election. Some of you also may have noticed that many DEl offices are quietly changing their name to ""inclusive excellence"" or ""culture and climate"" to align with LaVar's new title. And now during this meeting on Friday folks are being told we need to look to Texas and Florida as models for how to do DEl work - you know, the places where people lost their jobs and student support offices were completely disbanded. Not that campus was good before but now this place is quickly becoming explicitly unsafe for LGBTQ+ and BIPOC folks. For example, we are being told we can no longer host events for these groups or do work that specifically pertains to these groups because it would be seen as ""exclusionary"". Yes, this means that the Multicultural Student Center, the Black Cultural Center, Gender and Sexuality Campus Center, etc could all be disbanded at some point. There are so many students that choose UW because there are spaces that make them feel safe and I'm concerned these spaces will be going away soon. We have no support in central administration to continue the work.
Faculty are still protected under ""academic freedom"" but the staff that actually run the centers get no protections at all.

"Finding Madison's Best Bench (05) - The Chazen Sanctorum **Where:**

Chazen Art Museum

Downtown Madison

Third floor, south facing side of building

https://preview.redd.it/ekuwnhsr0pbd1.jpg?width=3668&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2f9b72e82134032cb7cca0d6db1831fbafb90a7

|The Details|
|:-|
|Sun conditions: Limited due to roof &amp; walls|
|Parking: Come park your butt on this bench (parking garages nearby)|
|Wind conditions: The occasional museum draft|
|Accessibility: Easy access on 3rd floor|

**About:**

We step inside for our next bench review, located on the third floor of the Chazen Art Museum. The Chazen is open 7 days/week and free to explore, featuring about 25,000 pieces of art. That's what the website says. I did not count to verify. Can you imagine?

Anyway, the bench.

**Pros:**

* You have to walk past a bunch of really cool art to find it
* Feels like a piece of furniture Doctor Strange would have in his...sanctorum?
* Overlooks the historic Buffalo Wild Wings on University Ave.
* Free locker storage for your stuff (roughly the size of a small child)

*Editor's note: don't lock your children in the lockers*

**Cons:**

* You become art once you sit down. *Are you ready for that?*
* Often occupied by art students wearing cooler clothes than you
* Not pleasant if you have a phobia of floor-to-ceiling windows or benches
* You face the looming possibility of forgetting your locker code and never seeing your child again

*Bonus trivia: The museum opened in 1970 as the Elvehjem Art Center, named after a past president of UW-Madison. It was renamed Chazen Art Museum in 2005. But let's be real. We're both going to forget that in like 30 minutes.*

**It’s a great bench for...**

* Having acoustically pleasing conversations
* Resting off the pitcher you just had at the Terrace
* Trying to remember what this place used to be called
* Thinking about what [L'Amante](https://chazen.wisc.edu/collection/24802/lamante/) means to you (cool sculpture on same floor)
* Breaking up with someone very quietly using art puns
   * ""I'm no longer drawn to you""
   * ""The colors of us have faded""
   * ""You used to be my Mona Lisa""

**Final thoughts:**

This bench is a treat. It's beautifully designed, comfortable and the perfect place to take a break from the art and people watch on the street below. While it's often in use during the museum's busy hours, stop by on a weekday afternoon and you'll likely have the seat to yourself.

My 5th grader also uses Canva quite a bit to create presentations and things. They’re learning the same skills, just with different programs.

Do I worry sometimes that they’re getting a lot of screen time at school? Sure. But I also see them doing a lot off-screens, too. They bring home plenty of written work and worksheets. My husband teaches high school and he still does a lot on paper with his students, has them work out problems on the white board, etc. I trust teachers are trying to find a good balance.

"Mineral Point temporary traffic pattern frustration on west side  TLDR; I’m super annoyed that signage is telling people to effectively only use a single lane, which is the lane that the bus is currently using anyway (the middle one). 


For the past week or so, we’ve had signage on the new leftmost bus lane in both directions that says “bus only” while the rightmost lane in both directions is still largely blocked off and useless (especially when traveling west). 

That means that 90+% of the traffic has been going in the middle lane only. I think there would be a better split but for whatever reason there was a traffic sign that said to use the “right two lanes” only… but the bus isn’t even using the bus lane whatsoever yet. 

So why oh why are we telling people to only use the 2 right lanes, which is effectively only the middle lane? Couple weeks ago it was “all 3 lanes open”. The whole situation is just fucking moronic and what shouldn’t be congested/ that bad traffic is obnoxious to drive in. There’s cones everywhere still (how many of them are really necessary at this point?) and some placement is just well into the left “bus” lane of traffic. 

(There were huge holes in the middle of the road but also why use the biggest cones possible to the extent I can’t even travel in the left lane because I would be pushed into the only lane of traffic?? This also was a problem even when we were told to use all lanes of traffic.)

Again why are we telling cars to not use the “bus only” lane when THE BUS ISNT USING IT YET and isn’t even able to use the old bus lane! UGHHHHHHHHH (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ 

I’d understand a transition period for people to “learn” but you can’t be doing that while there is only 1 gd lane open.

I for one stopped being a little rule follower after the 5th time of seeing a bus in the only open lane. 

Edit: I’m not anti public transportation. I’m anti this poor transition process. Also this is clearly a vent post. 🫶😁

Edit2: so many people complaining that I’m complaining lmfao. Dunno if this post did it but seems as of 7:30pm 9/18 the cones have moved so that at least we can use more than a single lane of traffic. Thx to all those who boosted this by commenting ☺️.

"ESQUIRE CLUB IS OPEN ONCE AGAIN MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - A popular Madison supper club is back open for business. Kavanaugh’s Esquire Club closed abruptly at the end of February. But the original owner is now back with the business and he’s ready to get customers back at the bar.

“A lot of people were disappointed and now they are glad we are back and are putting it back the way its supposed to be,” said owner John Kavanaugh.

Kavanaugh said he sold the restaurant in April of 2024 to a buyer who “lasted until the first of this month”.

“So, we took it back over,” said Kavanaugh.

The bar at Kavanaugh's Esquire Club(Tim Elliott)

The restaurant has been a staple on Madison’s northside for decades.

“We are going to put the Esquire back the way it belongs, it’s a family tradition,” said Kavanaugh. “My parents bought the restaurant in 1947. I was born in 1949. I grew up in the restaurant and so ran it as a neighborhood supper club and that’s what I want to take it back to because it lost a little bit of its character.”

Kavanaugh said he’s not worried about opening up the restaurant again adding “I’ve done this forever you know. It’s like riding a bike.”

"I left for the last decade. Bounced around New England and the South. I’m back longterm for a number of reasons:

-This state is underrated outside of the region, which means transplants have yet to move here in droves and drive up the cost of living. In both Massachusetts and Texas, I saw the cost of living being driven up by transplants flocking to the cities. Here, it’s still possible to find places to thrive near cities without living in a rundown shoebox.

-Our education system is very well ranked nationally, and it’s still possible to afford a home in a district with highly rated schools, unlike in many other states. The fact our state prioritizes public education at all is great and not the case for many other states.

-Our politics are not perfect, but at least there’s a public dialogue and a progressive streak here. In Texas, I found apathy to be frustratingly present. There’s little motivation or anger to push for things to improve amongst the people smart enough to understand things should be different. I feel more at home in a place where people genuinely give a shit about making things better for their fellow humans and future generations.

-We have incredible access to gorgeous parks and hiking trails. Our nature scene is beautiful and special. We also prioritize preserving this nature for future generations whereas a lot of other places don’t (cough Texas).

-Seasons are a good thing. Being in warmer climates sounds nice until you realize you still get seasons there, they just range from decently nice to hotter than satan’s ballsack. There are still long stretches of time in which you won’t want to go outside, plus you may deal with scary weather forces you won’t in Wisconsin such as hurricanes.

My husband and I went back and forth considering every region of the country for our long term home for literally years before finally deciding Wisconsin is where we should go. Since arriving earlier this year, we’re more convinced everyday that we made the right decision.

"Giving up on selling our condo Some weeks back I asked if the Madison housing market is slowing down. I was downvoted quite a bit and people commented that it is not.

Today I do not know what to do. we have a townhome listed in the market since mid May, with no offer. We had open houses, some showing etc but nothing concrete in terms of offer. It is on the west side, great quite neighborhood, near Gammon and Old Sauk. Two bedroom, two bath, dated but well maintained, close to bus stop - all boxes are checked.

Yet I am stressed with lack of buyer and our agent is  also saying the market is getting slow. we already moved out so we do want to close this out, but I am not sure that will happen.

One draw back we do have is that the master  bedroom upstairs has a full bath, which means anyone on the second bedroom needs to come down to use the bathroom downstairs if master bedroom is locked. This is the only issue I can think off.

Sorry for the rant, but at the beginning ning of the process the realtor told us this will sell in one week with multiple offers - yet after 50 days here we are.

Every major retailer is warning that these tariffs will lead to catastrophic economic contraction. It is almost inevitable at this point as the tariffs are officially in place.

Couple the tariffs with the threats of WW3 by Trump. The abandoning of our allies. The threats to attack Greenland. 

Alliances in this world keep us safe. America has not been attacked by a foreign country (directly) since World War 2. A huge reason is that we have strategic alliances with NATO and the UN. Both of which Trump is advocating for us to leave immediately.

We are at a crossroads America. Do we want to continue down this path where our own citizens are viewed as enemies? Ask yourselves why one party is spending a lot of time telling you who to hate. Ask yourselves why you hate those people.

I hate Russia because they invaded another country, indiscriminately killed thousands to steal land that is not theirs. Ukraine is our ally, and we promised we would protect them from Russian aggression in exchange for them giving up their nuclear weapons. By not honoring our agreement with Ukraine, we are making it so EVERY FUTURE AGREEMENT WE MAKE IS VIEWED UNDER THE LENS THAT IT IS WORTHLESS.

What will it take for people to understand that we NEED these other countries as much as they need us?!",reddit,general madison
"Hi, forgive me I am just a ignorant kid that wants change in this world but don’t know where to start (looking for possible resources) Please forgive me for my rants But you know if there are any ways I can help society at all in any way? Like if any knows anything about the homeless population or if the city officials are actually friendly people to talk to? I feel like if I were to try to talk to someone, anyone , that I would be put in my place pretty quickly. I haven’t lived in Madison for a while so I really am not sure how everything is going so if anything useful comments would help. 

I mean it’s pretty obvious the system we live in where there are infinite buffets of food that throw away and waste food literal feet across the street from a homeless person starving. 

In a world where money is the single most important thing to pass on to future generations. I saw while googling a Chinese tiny house only costs 75$ to build . But me and maybe no one really knows for sure how a city official would really think or how they think, would assume they’re not very friendly and and don’t know if its worth to even risk a conversation with a city official. 

It’s crazy yes you can survive perfectly fine in a jail with three meals and a bed but die in the streets and be “free”. 

Tl;dr : I am sorry I am really stupid kid and maybe the constant media is getting to me , it deeply angers me and saddens me the state of this world where the paradox that the creation of a “successful” society itself creates inequality . And I honestly have no idea what I could do. I’m Looking for resources, maybe a community, but also aknowledge the fact that people value their space and being left alone.

And yes I am prepared to be put in my place in the comments as well as the mods of this subreddit ban me so sorry for everything.",reddit,general madison
"Small protest tomorrow 4-5pm at University Ave and Shorewood Blvd Last Saturday, a group of about 60 people held an impromptu protest at University Ave and Shorewood Blvd near Ancora Coffee and the Shorewood BRT station.

"Bolster Local Community Many of us are calling our federal representatives which is AWESOME and we should keep it up. I also think it would be really smart to start calling local government officials/representatives to encourage them invest time and resources into preparing our community for the coming political storm. 

Some things to consider:

1. We need a solid and effective local food system. Let’s make sure our small local farmers have what they need to support our community! I for one would LOVE to see some food forests in the city of Madison. 

2. Support small businesses. Many of us are partaking in boycotts and it can be hard to find what we need. Let’s help our local businesses supply what the community needs to uphold boycotts. 

3. Bolster mutual aid programs. Not only do we need more volunteers to step up and help out at food pantries, etc., but we also need our local government to support them too. 

4. Encourage local government to teach our communities their rights when interacting with ICE. 

Let your aldermen, representatives, senators, and mayors know how you feel about this. Got more ideas on how we can strengthen our local community? Share them below, I’d love to hear your thoughts!",reddit,general madison

"I’ve lived both places. For a young 26 yo black male, I’d probably lean towards Milwaukee, just because Madison is *so* white. Like. Really, really white. Food is better in Milwaukee (more options, more diversity), better access to sports and large events. If you love basketball, the deer district is incredible. More places, people, things to do. 

Madison is a “big small town”. You’re not going to see much crime here, but you’re also not going to get the amenities of living in a big city. It’s quiet. It’s beautiful. There’s lots of nature. 

Milwaukee has quite a bit of gun crime and, for the 5 years I lived there, I found it hard to find a community as a 20something white female. 

I wish I could mold the two into one city, because I reeeeally loved living both places for different reasons.

Edit: saw your question about real estate. Was an RE agent in both cities. Prices are definitely more stable in Madison, we’re insulated here by Epic, the University, and the capitol. It’s probably a safer investment here, but that’s not to say that Milwaukee is a bad investment - prices have skyrocketed there in the last few years and you should be able to get something really cool in either place for your budget. 

Milwaukee has plenty of ball players that purchase property, I like the architecture there better, and you can probably live in cooler neighborhoods. 

Here, you’re getting lake, capitol, or nature views. I probably could keep going on about your specific questions, so feel free to reach out directly if you’re looking for more. (:",reddit,downtown
"WI girls trip itinerary so my group of friends just realized of the 50 US states, the only state none of us have been to is Wisconsin. We do an annual girls trip and love to choose random destinations to spend time together in a new place. These trips usually involve nature (hiking, skiing, kayaking—all beginner friendly) and exploring/activities, so we don’t want to be in a major city or middle of nowhere. We don’t party on these trips much; we’d prefer to cultivate a temporary home in a quaint Airbnb/boutique hotel, where we can develop a cozy routine. 

we are either going to WI between Christmas-new years or next March. What would be your recommendations for where to go, depending if it’s spring or winter? Or would you recommend waiting til summer/fall?

It’d be awesome to see Chequamegon national forest, unless there’s another good one out there. What are some necessary Wisconsin culture things we’d need to include? Is there anything quirky and off beat to do? 

This would be about 7-10day long trip and we’d rather not be in more than 2 places. We would be flying in, open to renting a car.",reddit,general madison
"Thalaivas Restaurant  I just need to share my love of this place. 

This restaurant opened in Middleton on Parmenter Street pretty recently. I've now been three times, trying something different on the menu every time. They specialize in South Indian and Chinese food. The service is great and the food is incredible. 

Tonight I had eggplant curry that blew my mind.

"Today is my birthday, I don't have anyone in this world to wish me happy birthday or remind me that I matter Wisconsin has been my home for years. This place holds all the memories. Memories of her, my sister, gone too soon. A year ago, we would’ve been together. She would’ve baked me a cake. Her absence feels louder today than usual. This isn’t just home, it’s her. 

My chronic illness has worsened, medical bills keep piling up, my rent is overdue, I'm forced to choose between keeping the lights on or staying alive. I know it’s only a matter of time before I’m forced to leave. The thought of packing up and leaving feels like abandoning her all over again. I don't know how I can leave a place that holds the last pieces of someone I loved so much but I don't have any other choice. The absence of connection, the emptiness of knowing that if I disappeared, there’d be no one to notice hurts so much. 

I’ve run out of choices, out of time and out of hope. I have nothing, can't afford anything not even a full meal most days, no one left to turn to, and no idea where I’ll go. Somewhere cheaper, they say, like that makes it easier. But no state, no city, no new place could replace what I’m losing here. I'm afraid to start all over again. 

I wanted to quit and look for a different job, build a better meaningful future but I feel paralyzed with no energy left. I'm scared of life, it's an intense fear of what's next, what's going to happen tomorrow, where am I going to sleep tomorrow.

I wish I could live just one day without a worry in the world, forget about everything and do something different that makes me feel alive. 

Wisconsin will always be my home, I don't know what to do or where to go but this place has a special place in my heart, all my memories lives here and it's all I ever have. Thank you",reddit,general madison

Seriously considering switching to UW Health and have asked them to improve their hours and locations which they say they are working on. They really need a 24 hour location on both east and west sides. I've been waiting for better hours to switch but I had a bizarro experience myself with WG Friday which is pushing me to consider changing now.   
  
In addition to delivery mentioned by someone else, they also offer 24 hour kiosks and there's the pharmacy at the urgent care on Mineral Point Road. I realize that won't help you at midnight but the urgent care one has decent hours. UW  Health really wants retail pharmacy business all of a sudden, so I'd say it's worth talking to them about your needs and how they could meet them. Especially if you have complex medical neds or just multiple meds, I'd be more confident they'd actually provide the healthcare part of a pharmacy (advising, watching for issues) in addition to filling an Rx.

"Dane County Board Special Election is set for June 17th Liz Doyle resigned from the Dane County Board of Supervisors at the end of March.

First off, no one should feel embarrassed about their reading skills or interests. I’m not an expert in adult reading skills, but I think that in general practice - like any skill - makes a difference.  Think of reading as anything that you read rather than feel you have to tackle a full length book to be a reader - how-to web sites or videos with captions, video game captions, texts, song lyrics, fine print on food packages - etc.  Turning on captions for videos might help with spelling and pronunciation. 

The library also has a collection of adult books written in simplified language for adult new/learning readers. There are also several resources in the community that might help you improve your reading skills. [Literacy Network has adult education classes](https://www.litnetwork.org/study/reading-and-writing/) specifically focused on literacy skills, [Madison Writing Assistance offers writing assistance](https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/partnerships/madison-writing-assistance) in several of our libraries, and there are more resources on our [Literacy and Tutoring page](https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/resources/services/literacy-and-tutoring).",reddit,general madison

"For those who think we legally cannot do this, [this article covers most of the legal issues involved.](https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2021/03/10/can-wisconsinites-recall-ron-johnson/)

The Wisconsin Elections Commission [has published a manual that is titled ""Recall of Congressional, County, and State Officials""](https://elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/2022-04/Recall%2520Manual-State.Const_.%2520FINAL%2520%2528Rev.%252008-2020%2529_Final.pdf) that details the requirements for doing a recall.

In 1979, the state Attorney General [Issued an opinion stating that it could be done.](https://casetext.com/case/opinion-no-oag-54-1)

There is one SCOTUS case since then that touches peripherally on these issues, namely [Thornton vs. US Term Limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Term_Limits,_Inc._v._Thornton) that was about an Arkansas law imposing term limits in 1995.

Note that in the Thornton case there is language in both the majority opinion that struck down term limits for congressional position and in the minority dissent, there is language that support the notion of recalls-

John Paul Stevens in the majority opinion, stated -

&gt;**""...the right to choose representatives belongs not to the States, but to the people.""**

Clarence Thomas in the dissent stated -

&gt;""**Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people**.""

I would think the 10th Amendment would strongly apply in this case, which says **any powers that are not specifically given to the federal government, nor withheld from the states, are reserved to those respective states, or to the people at large.**

***HOWEVER, I would like to point out that this*** [***change.org***](http://change.org) ***petition is not the vehicle for recalling Johnson.  The Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) has a very specific format and filing requirements, and ""wet ink"" signatures gathered in person are required with a mailing address and voting municipality, not electronic signatures.***

The actual mechanics of putting together a recall petition are not hard, the WEC will even review a proposed petition for format and legality.  A recall committee needs to be registered with the WEC, and once the start of circulation begins, there is a time limit to gather the signatures.

What is needed is organization - getting groups together to get their members on the streets gathering signatures.  A website is needed to download the petition so people can gather signatures, with a post office box for them to send them in.  After the Act 10 recalls, the legislature increased the number of signatures required to 25%, which is a very tall order.

I have a Recall Ron Johnson facebook page I set up years ago, I haven't done much with it lately, which has received an uptick in hits recently.

If we're going to do this, we need to get organized and find organizations that will get behind this, not a [change.org](http://change.org) petition.",reddit,general madison

Nobody's asking for that. We're looking for some sign that you understand what you're asking for.

Because people like you scream about ""do something"" but have no clue what they should do or why they can't... they have zero power because they don't control any of the government. Expecting them to be effective opposition is silly. We got fucked in the election and this is what happens.

"I’m all for Journalism confronting disinformation and holding our politicians accountable; however, this article just felt like a long rant. The author, Cujo, makes a lot of sarcastic or rhetorical comments, and it ends up obfuscating the message. Besides restating that the Governor has Veto powers (which the reader is likely already aware of), the Author doesn’t offer up any “call to action” or recommendations on what we should do. Finally, some of the research done for this article seems shallow. For an example, the author brings up that the budget only allocates $15 million to supporting passenger rail; except, the author is using a link to a decade old article about train project costs. I’m assuming $15 million goes even less far nowadays, but why didn’t the Author reach out to an expert for better analysis. It’s a safe assumption that $15 million is not a lot of money for passenger rail, but the author doesn’t provide an argument on why it should be more, or how much more it should be.

"Hi, thanks for your question. I understand that you asked it earnestly and that asking it took some vulnerability.

You are feeling a bit challenged by Room I think because you’re meant to. We are challenging you and the way you experience the world. Men are not our center, you are right about that. I can imagine it might be weird or noticeable to come into a place where that is the case if you’ve not experienced it before. We read men, we staff pick books by men, we order in and display books by men, all of our sections include books by men – actually I’d say most sections have predominantly male authors because even though we curate the bookstore to include other voices we are still curating it from what’s available from publishers that continue to prioritize and center men.

Every book at Room is also for men. All the book displays are also for men (I hope men also want to read books written by women, books written by queer people.) Right now we have a display that is just Ducks and I just took down a Jazz display so that I could put up our Indie Bookstore Day display. We have a Severance display. I have a Palestinian fiction display. Men write about ducks and jazz and Palestine and freaky tech dystopias. Our sci-fi and fantasy section, our fiction section, our horror section, our mystery section are FILLED with male writers which is WHY we make displays and face out books by queer and trans and women writers – to help them be found. 

We hope that any customer who isn’t finding what they’re looking for will ask a bookseller to help them with a recommendation. Men do this all the time. For example, you could say “hey, I really like adventure books with a male protagonist, no gore please. What do you rec?” or “the last book I remember liking was Hatchet, my favorite tv show is Game of Thrones, what the heck should I read??” And we’ll pull books for you. This is part of the job we love and we do it all day every day. If we don’t have a book or author you’re looking for we can always order something in for you. We do this all the time. Last Friday, a veteran in his 70s came in and told me he just moved to Madison and all his books were damaged in his move. I am currently helping him replace his entire Louis L’Amour and Tom Clancy collections (these are men).

I am not going to make you a shelf because, as I’ve said, every display in here is also for men. I WILL encourage you to browse the bookstore and to ask us questions. You live near a bookstore with near-constant changing displays, with a staff full of nerds whose interests are vast and not gendered – I mean, Anada is obsessed with UFOs and Arctic horror; Russell really only reads books about jazz and dogs; G primarily reads graphic novels about wrestling or weirdos; Gretchen reads sci-fi and fantasy, etc. I trust that if you take the time, you will find something here you’re inspired by. There are books here for you and you will love them. We’ll help you find them.

"It's because somewhere along the line Wisconsin decided ""slower = safer"" when the fact is, it's far less to do with the number on the sign, and far more to do with the difference in speed between you and other motorists.


Now, just to head off the BUTT AKSHUALLY response I actually get, I concede that accidents *at* higher rates of speed are more dangerous.  That's not the point Im making, it's the liklihood of *getting* into an accident that is reduced.  If everyone else is going 80 and you're doing 65, you are more likely to cause an accident, despite being slower.  It's only truly safer if you're all going 65, and even then only safer if you actually wreck...which is more easily avoided if...wait for it....you're all going about the same speed.


Also caveat that I ain't talking about residential roads; not saying everyone should do 40 in a 25 and that it would be safer.  But there's a big difference between residential streets and highways/interstates, namely being there is no legitimate reason to expect pedestrian traffic on a 60+ mph roadway.


If you go with the flow, you're statistically speaking a more conscientious and dare I say, safer driver, overall, then someone that obstinately just sets their cruise and turns their brain off to the things happening around them.  Like people in the left lane of a 70 doing 60 that people are flying by doing 80.  It may seem counterintuitive, but the person going slower in that case is 100% the more dangerous driver in that scenario.  People should not be passing on the right, and if you are being passed on the right, YOU were in the wrong fuckin lane.

Also, back in the late 1990s when we had the Bob Fest started and going (all organized by locals, and eventually taken over by progressives in Dane County and moved to Madison) Bernie Sanders came to visit and stated that we were the ""best little progressive small town in the country"".

College students can [play a pivotal role](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/04/13/wisconsin-college-students-voted-in-big-numbers-in-supreme-court-race/70099976007/) in a swing state like Wisconsin, where elections are often won by razor-thin margins.

For most student voters, Nov. 5 will mark their first time casting a ballot in a presidential election.

Voting rules can be confusing to navigate — and even more so for college students, most of whom live at a new address each school year. Here's a guide on what to know, where to register and how to vote:

# Decide where to vote

If you are going to college in a different city than your hometown, here are [some factors the U.S. Election Assistance Commission](https://vote.gov/guide-to-voting/college-student) offers for consideration when deciding where to vote:

* Which location is more convenient for you?
* Who is on the ballot in each place?
* Are there local policies or particular issues that are important to you in either place?
* Where you register to vote will not affect your federal financial aid, including FAFSA, Pell Grants, Perkins or Stafford loans.

# Determine your eligibility

To [vote in Wisconsin](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2021/0098_wisconsin_voter_requirements_informational_paper_98.pdf), you must:

* Be a U.S. citizen
* Be at least 18 years old on or before Election Day
* Have lived at your current Wisconsin address for at least 28 consecutive days before Election Day
* Not be currently serving a felony sentence, including probation or parole

# Determine if you need to register to vote

You will need to register or re-register if any of the following situations apply:

* You are a first-time voter
* You have moved to a new address (or even changed apartment numbers) since the last time you voted
* You have changed your legal name since the last time you voted.

# Register to vote in Wisconsin

There are several options for voter registration:

# What documents do I need to prove Wisconsin residency for voter registration?

If you have a Wisconsin's driver's license that shows your current address, you're all set.

That's often not the case for college students, though. To prove residency, you will need one of the following forms of ID that shows your current name and address:

* An electronically displayed or printed Voter Enrollment Verification Letter from your university's Office of the Registrar
* A current residential lease (Note: This cannot be used as proof of address if registering by mail.)
* A university or college ID card with a photograph of the cardholder, accompanied by a fee statement for the current semester
* A printed copy of your current bursar’s statement
* A utility bill for the period commencing not earlier than 90 days before the election. A printed copy of an online bill is acceptable. So is showing the documents electronically on your phone.
* A paycheck
* A bank, credit union or credit card statements. A printed copy of an online statement is acceptable
* A check or other document issued by a unit of government
* An official identification card or license issued by a Wisconsin governmental body or unit
* An identification card issued by an employer in the normal course of business, which has a photograph of the cardholder, but not a business card

If you have a driver's license or ID card from another state, you will also [need to provide](https://elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/2020-06/El-131%2520Voter%2520Registration%2520App_Fillable-%2520%2528REV%25202020-06%2529_0.pdf) the last four digits of your Social Security number.

# Get a voter ID

OK, so you're registered to vote! Now you need a voter ID to bring to the polls. The address on the ID card doesn't matter. Its purpose is to prove your identity.

Some acceptable forms of voter ID:

* Wisconsin driver's license or state ID
* U.S. passport
* U.S. Uniformed Services card
* Veterans Affairs ID
* Tribal ID
* Certificate of naturalization
* Campus-issued voter ID

# Can I use my college ID card to vote in Wisconsin?

Yes, but [there are caveats](https://myvote.wi.gov/Portals/0/Documents/AcceptablePhotoIDs.pdf?ver=vS9TnMVULlI9Yi0mGe-P0g%3D%3D). It must include:

* Date the card was issued
* Student signature
* Expiration date no later than two years after date of issuance

Some universities, such as the University of Wisconsin-Madison, have campus ID cards that do not meet these requirements but [issue separate campus voter IDs that qualify](https://vote.wisc.edu/badgersvote/voting-in-wisconsin/get-a-wisconsin-voter-id/).

# What if my college ID card has expired?

You can [still present your expired college ID](https://elections.wi.gov/photoid#230548828-165913763) at the polls if you also provide a separate document that proves current enrollment, such as a tuition fee receipt, enrollment verification letter or class schedule.

# Can I vote absentee?

Yes. This might be a good option for Wisconsin students who want to vote using their home address but who are living on campus in a different municipality.

Request an absentee ballot to be mailed to you at [myvote.wi.gov](https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/).

Once the absentee ballot arrives, complete it and return as soon as possible. The U.S. Postal Service recommends mailing it at least one week in advance of Election Day.

# Can I vote early in Wisconsin?

Yes, in some places. Early voting, also called in-person absentee voting, begins Oct. 22 and run through Nov. 3.

Times and locations for early voting vary by municipality. [Check MyVote](https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/Vote-Absentee-In-Person) or [contact your municipal clerk for early voting hours](https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/My-Municipal-Clerk). Some universities publish this information on their own websites.

# It's Election Day, and I'm not registered to vote. Can I still vote?

Yes! You can register to vote on Election Day. Make sure to bring documentation to the polls. You can only vote at your designated polling place. [Find your Polling Place at myvote.wi.gov/en-us/Find-My-Polling-Place.](https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/Find-My-Polling-Place) 

Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. Everyone in line at 8 p.m. gets to vote.

# Voting in your out-of-state hometown

Even if you’re away at school for most of the year, you may have the option to vote in your hometown.

Other states' rules around voter registration and absentee voting vary, so it's best to consult your local election commission or secretary of state for more information.

Some general guidelines:

* Register to vote using your permanent address in your hometown. Use your college address as your mailing address on your registration.
* Many states allow you to ask for a mail ballot if you’re unable to vote in person. Some states mail every voter a ballot automatically. Each state has its own guidelines, so check to see what the rules are in your state or territory. You can have the mail ballot sent to your college address. 
* If you will be in your hometown during the election, you may also have the option to vote in person.

# I'm studying abroad. Can I vote?

Yes, but study abroad students should budget extra time needed to request, receive and mail your ballot.

Wisconsin considers study abroad students to be “[temporary overseas citizens](https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/Military-Overseas-Voters/Temporary-Overseas-Voters),"" which has a similar process to absentee voting by mail. Email your ballot request to your municipal clerk. Include your name, registration address, email address for the ballot to be sent and a copy of an acceptable photo ID.

"I've read the threads: duct cleaning So i've read and even contributed to the ""duct cleaning"" threads on the sub.  My personal view is that this doesn't really need to be done however two things have come un\\p in the time i've owned this house: first we have had our HVAC folks (Harker)out here a couple of times for general service and this most recent visit they showed my wife a picture of our ducts and she said that were ""super dirty"".  The second thing that causes me some concern is that i opened up a register this winter because i could see debris being blown against the inside by the air coming out.  When i opened this register i found a bunch of debris like paper from construction materials, nails, plastic bottle caps, and a bunch of wood shavings.  Part of me wonders if the people who did the ""remodel"" of this place just swept their dirt and debris into the open registers before doing the trim work and installing the registers.  It would not surprise me at all.  If that's the case wouldn't it be a good idea to have them cleaned out?  Or isa duct cleaning even really going to get al of this?  Also - if we do decide to go forward with the job who does this sub recommend? TIA.

I get the end goal, but I think what a lot of people are missing or ignoring or whatever, is that even places with tons and tons of public transit that's running constantly still has tons and tons of vehicular traffic, so by making all the traditional arteries like min pt effectively equivalent to a residential side street, they're basically turning a single point of conflict into dozens because now there's no benefit to use the arterial that was designed to accommodate said higher traffic flow and it's spilling out into the neighborhoods around them.



I can't wait to see what effect all the tens of thousands of commuters that live out in the burbs because they can't fucking afford to live in this city has when there is literally no way to get through this city faster than 25mph outside of the beltline which is unfortunately located nowhere near downtown where some of our largest employers are located.

If you’re not familiar with it, it’s basically an app to help you meet new people/friends. You can opt in or out on a given Wednesday for a 10 AM meet up on the following Saturday with a random group of 2-4 people at a coffee shop.

I guess my questions are: 

1) Does anyone know of something that’s similar that has options for helping me meet new people on weeknights? 

I imagine with practice, I will be become better at doing this organically out in the wild, but something like Mesh makes the process much easier/manageable for me for now.

2) Related, I love coffee shops, but I wondered if there is something like Mesh but instead matches you up with people for a randomish event, such as bowling, hiking, axe throwing, board games, yoga, foodie events, etc.

I know there are dedicated groups for these individual types of things - and I may just join a bunch - but I like the idea of something that is about getting people outside of their comfort zones and constantly exposing us to new things we might not have realized we like.

TL;DR : I’m liking the Mesh concept, but wondered if there are similar things for weeknight meet ups and/or that has other events which are not only coffee shop meet ups.",reddit,general madison

I also vividly remember the lines to vote in college. We had two wards in Whitewater and one was students and one was townies, and there were 12 polling booths for townies and 4 for students and how our state senator for Whitewater would do town halls and complain about all the students. And I remember Scott McCallum jacking tuition on me while I was in college and giving no fucks at how much it hurt low income students (which I was) and being told by an uncle, who I really respected, that I was an idiot for not supporting W in 2004 because something something freedom fries and hadjis are bad. 

I knew the GOP was fucked when they damned John McCain for refusing to not shit on Obama and or call him a secret Muslim. Or when Glenn Grothman said women don’t care about earning money. 

I can go on and on and on. The GOP has been a bunch of losers since Newt won the speakership. 

I remember Mark Belling arguing against public transit in Milwaukee because blacks from the inner city were taking the bus to the Chuck E Cheese at Brookfield square and starting fights with other black people. Like, huh?

I'm so proud of them for opening a second location and it's gorgeous. the thing is the menu is slightly different for some reason so my spicy beef noodles came with different veggies and just wasn't as good. So I drive the extra 15 mins to the original location and pick it up even though the new one is closer to me. 

I miss when I lived at the apartments across the street, quick jaunt and gold was in your tummy.  

Has anyone tried the noodle place on state street yet? I'm curious how it compares. Was recommended it strongly by a tourist who gets it every time they visit but havnt had a chance to check it out myself.",reddit,downtown

"For most of the islands you do need to reserve the camp sites. There maybe be some with backcountry or dispersed camping, such as on Outer Island. You could camp there without a reservation. I think you're also required to submit your plan so they know where you'll be paddling on which days.

If you've never paddled in Lake Superior, or if you do not have experience sea kayaking with spray skirts and performing rescues, i'd strongly recommend taking a class on rescues. That Lake kills people paddling around the islands every year, often times people who have no idea that a storm on one end of the lake can create very dangerous conditions anywhere on the lake or have no idea how quickly conditions can turn life threatening out there.

It's easy to over plan. My first time out there I kayaked from Little Sand Bay to Michigan Island on the first day, which was around 24 miles of paddling. On the subsequent days i worked my way through some of the islands counter clockwise. It was a wonderful experience but going between multiple islands is a pretty big paddle, especially if the wind and seas pick up and i definitely pushed myself in terms of fatigue which is unsafe.

Equipment wise, I'd strongly recommend wet suits and you absolutely should have a marine radio with you and use the weather radio feature to listen to the wave forecast. I ended up leaving a day early because the following day was expected to have 5-8 foot waves and I didn't want to risk big seas if I didn't need to. i would also recommend taking a monocular with you so you can look out away from shore when doing your assessment of conditions. The wet suits might save your life if you turn over a boat in the lake and it takes you 10-15 minutes to get back in and empty your boat out with a bilge. 

The water is cold, and hypothermia will start to set in within 10 minutes without a wet suit.

When you go, definitely check out devil's island. It's very cool, and my second time kayaking the Islands I took my wife and we had lunch on some of the rock shelves before circumnavigating the Island.",reddit,general madison

"If you want to be in the city, I would suggest the near east side as there are plenty of restaurants and bars there and it’s more of a mixed/adult crowd. You won’t run into college students there on a night out. The east side in general is gonna be more blue collar/artsy. The west side has some cool neighborhoods too but the areas that will have more bars and restaurants are really close to campus so your daughter may not get the space she needs. 

Otherwise, I would suggest suburbs like Sun Prairie, Middleton, or Fitchburg. They’re all very close and convenient to Madison and it’s a quick Uber if you want to go out down town. Middleton and Sun Prairie have a decent amount of restaurants and bars of their own. Fitchburg less so (has some) but it’s really close to Madison.",reddit,campus

The fact that they've never seen a vet also makes me suspect this is what is happening.

If you adopt a pet, you are making a commitment to care for them the rest of their lives. That means you consider them in any new living situation before making a decision. Rehoming pets is traumatic for the animals. If you're not willing to make that commitment, then don't fucking have pets.

"u/Tongpete, 

Thank you for your ongoing support and for your feedback about your experiences at Central Library. We do put funding towards supporting those experiencing homelessness through staff resources, programs, and services. Those include specialized programs like: 

* **Coffee &amp; Connection:** Monthly program providing free coffee and refreshments while a different social services agency gives a brief explanation of the services they provide and then offers the chance for one-on-one questions and assistance.
* **Free Mending:** Offered at Central and Hawthorne Libraries, this program helps repair clothing for free thanks to volunteers from the Sewing Machine Project.
* **Second Harvest FoodShare:** Monthly program providing FoodShare (food assistance on a QUEST Card) benefit information: help applying and submitting documents, assistance with renewals and reporting changes, as well as ongoing benefit support.

We also have a staff person at Central Library whose role is to help connect us with other social service agencies downtown and throughout the City. They have been integral in coordinating with places like The Beacon, Porchlight, and others so that we can continue broadening the services that we offer. As always, the library can continue to improve the way that we support those experiencing homelessness (and, by extension, other visitors) in our spaces. 

But the library can only do so much to support unhoused patrons or those experiencing challenges with food insecurity, housing, addiction or other health issues, or other challenges.  The library also partners with other City and County departments to be part of a longer-term solution to these challenges in our community.",reddit,downtown

"Please make this shorter. The type of person who is likely to help already knows the obstacles you face. Start looking for a place independent of your boyfriend. Housing 2 people, even short term, is a whole lot different than one. The only mention of him in a post (if any), should be that you have one and will follow all house rules regarding him. Be prepared for the home owner to not want him to visit (and vice versa for any place he finds), or have strict rules about it that you must follow. Then state your approximate age (decade), your *regular* source of income and how long you’ve been there if it’s a job, what type/amount of regular housework you’re willing to do in exchange for rent, whether you use drugs of any kind, have a record, and how much you can actually consistently pay and still eat and get to work. Offering to pay weekly could help. 

Then, just say you are an introvert and prefer to keep to yourself. Trying to be someone you’re not will only make things worse. Admit you have poor social skills but don’t want that to be an issue, so clarifying rules and expectations up front would be helpful for both. Leave it at that. You sound sweet, but what you wrote makes you sound “difficult to live with”, even though that’s the opposite of what you’re trying to be.

In the meantime, make a list of issues you’ve had in the past that you need rules around, so that you can stick to the subject when you meet. Don’t post it here. I’d start with 1. Quiet hours 2. Notifications of coming/going (expected or not) 3. Food/dishes/kitchen/bathroom access/sharing/timing. 4. Visitor (including boyfriend) rules. 5. When/how problems will be addressed. Suggesting a weekly mtg might be a good idea. 6. Setting an end date or agreeing to a regular scheduled discussion about it.

Finally, use the opportunity to get some money saved, even $10/week. Sell plasma or get a side hustle. It sounds like ditching the nonfunctional car might be a good idea. You can’t afford upkeep/gas/registration/insurance if you can’t afford rent.

"27m here who recently escaped online dating with someone I met on Hinge. It's definitely rough out there; it took a couple months and a lot of likes, messages, matches and dates that went nowhere. You get long periods where you have few or no conversations, peppered with occasional bursts of activity that get your hopes up but eventually all smolder out.

From a guy's perspective, it sounds like you've got the right approach. As an average-looking guy, it's somewhat rare to get the first message from women on these apps. If you're getting ignored, you might be messaging guys who are already inundated with matches, or you might not be cutting through the noise. What types of initial messages are you sending?

For your profile, I think there are subreddits that give profile advice, but if you'd like, you can also DM it to me and I'll give you my 2 cents. But also, make sure you're writing it for the partner you want, not for your friends or the general crowd on Hinge or reddit randos. One of the best choices I made was putting some photos of me at HEMA/historical fencing events front and center. I figured anyone who thinks sword nerds are weird would filter themselves out of my dating pool. It worked - my current partner's opening message was to challenge me to a sword duel, and it was love at first fight. You can save yourself a lot of time, energy, and mediocre dates by putting your interests and intentions up front and letting others do the filtering for you. You'll get fewer matches overall but higher quality ones.

The most important thing I found on these apps is to protect your time, your energy, and your feelings. Recognize when the apps are making you feel bad about yourself and avoid them during those times. Don't spend too long trying to hold a conversation that's going nowhere or get the attention of someone who won't reciprocate. Don't get your hopes up on any one person until you've at least talked a while and been on a date.

Good luck out there. It mostly sucks, but there's a lot of fun dates and great people hiding amongst all the noise.",reddit,general madison
"The north side is generally considered the ""bad"" part -- any numbered street that intersects with Burleigh, Keefe, Hopkins, Tuetonia, North, Center, Locust, etc. There's plenty more but usually most neighborhoods west of I-43 past downtown headed north are no-go zones for most people. Williamsburg isn't far from trouble but it's not far from Shorewood either which is a nice suburb. Milwaukee is very very segregated as you'll come to learn. 

That said, I've spent a lot of time in those bad areas and nothing bad has ever happened to me.

"I will do what I can to address these in order:  
1) Mitchell is the closest airport to Racine, although you will still be within reasonable driving distance to O'Hare if you need a wider selection of locations and nonstop flights.  By reasonable driving distance, I mean 60-90 minutes.  Mitchell will get you non-stop to a lot of places in Florida: Orlando, Ft Meyers, Tampa, Miami.  Delta flies consistently out of Mitchell with layovers at their Hubs to get anywhere in the world.  I have found that flying out of Mitchell can be cheaper than Chicago on Delta specifically.  It is also one of the easiest airports I have ever used to get in and out of; check in lines are short, baggage claim is quick, and security is really easy (15-20minutes without TSA pre check, less than 5 with).

2) Winters are very comparable to Chicago.  We have had some mild winters lately.  TBD if it is related to climate change or just regular cycles.  If you can survive Colorado and Chicago, you will be fine here.  Racine is closer to Chicago than most out of towners realize.  A day trip to Chicago is not out of the question, especially by train.  The Hiawatha Amtrak runs there daily.

3) Golf Scene, Wisconsin is one of the most underrated in the country.  With that being said, Racine is not the hub of golf in Wisconsin.  A few notable courses: Erin Hills hosted the US Open.  That is going to be about 45 minutes north west of Racine in Hubertus. Kohler has a few courses that have hosted the Ryder Cup and other PGA events.  That is going to be 1.5-2hours north of Racine.  Sentry course in Stevens point is world class golf.  That is easily a 2 hour drive from Racine.  There are some decent courses in Greater Metro Milwaukee area, notably Brown Deer course that is part of the Milwaukee County Parks system, you should be able to get your fix.

4) Schools.  Just look up rankings.  30 minute drive to Racine, look at Oak Creek, Franklin, Muskego.

5) Food scene.  Milwaukee has always been underrated for food.  There are plenty of James Beard chefs in the city, as well as really good restaurants with a vast array of cuisine.  It is not all beer, brats, and cheese... although you will find plenty of those around.

If I were you, based on everything you mentioned, I would focus on Oak Creek.  The airport is in Oak Creek, the cost of living is decent, you are 30 minutes from downtown Racine and Downtown Milwaukee, and it seems to check the boxes you have listed.  Franklin falls in this category as well.  Muskego might be a little further out, but you will have more room.

The one thing I want to mention about Racine is that Downtown Racine can be a hike from the Interstate.  It can easily take 15-20 minutes to get to the downtown area from any of the exits.",reddit,downtown

"This is such a hard topic bc it all depends on WHY the person is unhoused.
Did they lose their home bc they lost their job and got evicted?
Or is it something else?

My brother was ""unhoused"" for a long time. He straight up said he preferred being unhoused because he didn't have to get clean or show that he was trying to get a job or going to state funded free therapy or putting in any effort whatsoever in order to keep the free housing.

The solution isn't throwing more money at them. It's reorganizing the money and efforts to hit the root of the cause.

My brother finally hit rock bottom one time and took himself to rehab. This is after 15 years of us trying to help, me personally spending thousands of dollars buying him food and clothing, paying his rent in apartments that he would constantly trash with his friends. He always ended up on the streets. Free housing never helped and instead my family always ended up having to pay for destruction costs and such. 

Not everyone comes to this realization on their own. He got some* help from going to AA meetings, etc., conversations with mental health professionals.

Rehab was state funded. Nothing that me or my family did ever helped. We threw money down the drain for over a decade. I'm so thankful for some of the resources available that were better equipped to help. He was able to discern between which ones actually help and now he's doing much better. Now he has housing that HE pays for and has a sense of responsibility for. No destructive behaviors have revealed themselves and he's doing great with great with his mental health outside of the regular seasonal depression. This has been a huge change. 

Also to a commenter above who said something about (paraphrased) walking past &amp; ignoring the unhoused and instead give to better equipped resources ---  I believe this is the best thing. I was on a run one time and was essentially attacked by an unhoused woman. You don't know what the unhoused person is dealing with mentally. My sister has been spit in her face and had to get checked for any potential diseases bc when she wiped her face she wiped off blood... Freaking nightmare. You do not know what the unhoused are dealing with physically and what could spread to you. Giving money is the safest option.


Not really sure what I'm saying here or why, but that's my story. And that's why I chose to never walk up to unhoused individuals (for my safety) and why I prefer to give to vetted resource centers and why I would never suggest to just give a free house to someone. It's a nuanced subject and it always requires looking into each person and their case in a very subjective way.",reddit,general madison

"Penn state fan here. Came to Madison back in 2021 and have decided to make the trip again in two weeks. Looking for some advice from some Badgers. In ‘21 it was a 11:00 kickoff so we took an uber from the hotel to Jordan’s Big 10 in the morning and then walked to the game after a few drinks. Worked out perfectly because we didn’t have to worry about parking and could relax after the game, hitting a few bars before ubering to dinner and back to the hotel once the crowd had cleared out. 

With it being a night game, does anyone have advice on when to go downtown, where to park if we drive, how getting an Uber afterwards might go with everyone trying to leave at the same time?

Thanks!",reddit,downtown
"First suggestion, Atwood/Willy St:


has some nightlife and dining and a small jazz spot


has a wide range of rental styles (nicerish apartments, older apartments, variety of houses in a variety of upkeep)


is close (some spots are walking distance with ease) to E Wash corridor that has live music (Sylvee, High Noon, Breese Stevens Field)


Easy drive to dorms (Southeast or Lakeshore) or near off-campus apartments that are typical, easy enough on public transit if you can walk to a bus stop, feasible to walk if you were in a bind and had to get to your child without motor assistance 


Moderate walk or easy drive to the Capitol and the top of State St (so, like, in summer if you're in the middle of Willy St, you can def stroll to the farmers market and have just a great f*cking day of it, but if you're going to the Overture Center for a show or chilling at the piano bar or hitting the comedy club in *winter,* you'd want to drive or Uber/Taxi ---- also, backtrack, farmers market is probably a really easy midway spot for you and your kid to share a day fyi).


Far enough from campus that you're not going to randomly bump into your kid year 1 ---- years 2+ you'll both be learning the city quickly enough to manage that sort of thing, but campus is a very different vibe than the Capitol Square which is still different than East Washington and then Willy/Atwood.


Some other ideas:


Monroe St can be cute. It's south and west of campus, some students live there, but the farther you go the more family oriented it becomes. It is cute, but I'd say it's nightlife is several steps below Willy/Atwood/E Wash area.


E Wash can be good in some ways, but if you look at the apartments near Breese Stevens, know that those shows are loud and your apartment gets a free view whether you like it or not.


Northside - less expensive if the Willy/Atwood rent is pricing you out, access to much of the nightlife by short drive, immediate access to airport if you like traveling (MSN is fairly expensive, but you are probably at that point that shelling out at extra $100-$200 on your ticket for the convenience of parking at MSN, having a 10-15 minutes security line, and enjoying a comfortable airport is better than saving that money and driving to MKE or ORD), developing (there's new restaurants popping up pretty steadily and they're mostly darn cute, Zippy Lube and Lola's are excellent examples), surprisingly good road access (hopping on to the interstate, state, and county highways to get around town is crazy easy).

Many other people choose to drive 55 or under in the far left passing lane (some of these people also fail to accelerate on entrance ramps and attempt to merge onto the highway at 35-45 mph into traffic going 55 mph). The combination of these two groups causes many in the first group to attempt aggressive and risky passing maneuvers either in the flex lane (when it is closed) or on the right because they have nowhere else to go to avoid the slow drivers clogging up the passing lane. If the slow drivers just stayed in the right lane when they wanted to drive at or below the speed limit and the speeders were a bit less crazy, then the beltline would be less chaotic.

"Appeal is a very, very, very low success rate. Bearing that in mind, it does not cost you anything extra, and it shows initiative. When you appeal, I recommend a few things:

1. Really think about why you want to be at UW Madison. If it’s just to party and be in that scene, this is not the way to go. You want to show the university why you want to be here academically. Is it the program that draws you in? Perhaps a certain professor(s)? Are you a student athlete? 

2. You have to write a detailed letter of why you are appealing, why you think the university made a mistake in not admitting you, and why you think they should reconsider. My advice: really hone in on *why* they rejected you in the first place, and capitalise on why. This is the perfect opportunity to show who you are. I would stay away from saying you belong here because you’ve wanted to be a badger your whole life or something like that. This is an academic admissions panel who reviews appeals, I would treat it like a legal proceeding. 

3. Find out why they rejected you. You mentioned you are a transfer student, perhaps you are missing the minimum required courses needed to be accepted? You could have a laundry list of successes and accomplishments, 4.0 GPA, Phi-Theta Kappa, etc, but if you do not have the minimum *required* courses completed, you will not be considered for admission. I would review the transfer website and cross reference what courses you have previously taken in high school and your time in college. You can find the information here: https://admissions.wisc.edu/apply-as-a-transfer/

4. It would help immensely to have an advocacy form accompany your appeal from the department of the school/program you’re attempting to attend. If you know the faculty well, and have had prior experiences/communications with them, you could reach out and have them write an advocacy form on your behalf, which basically states that they believe you would be a good fit for their program and your admission would be a fine addition to UW. I’m not sure if every department does this though. 

5. Letters of Recommendation. You were required to have one submitted on your behalf for your original application. With this appeal, I would try to get a few more. It will help if they are UW faculty, but anyone that knows you both academically and professionally will be just as sufficient. Essentially, the more people that can attest to your abilities, the better. UW favours connections! 

6. Don’t beat yourself up if your appeal gets denied. While it sounds egregious, it’s true that UW, same as every college, receives so many applications. Unfortunately, they cannot accept everyone. You being denied does not attest to your character or who you are. It does not represent your ability or knowledge. If you truly feel you belong here, get a few more math/science courses under your belt at a community college and reapply for next spring/fall. And trust me, the FOMO is real, I get it and I’ve been there. But, age is just a number, and success can be found at any age at anytime.

"Wisconsin renter issue Excuse the way this thread is written out. Im just in a situation where I don’t know what to do and facing it alone and need some guidance.

I am currently in a situation where the water pressure issue on my rental is basically nonexistent. Last July I noticed a significant decrease in water pressure. I changed the water filter coming into the house with no noticeable difference. I brought this up to my landlord and she didn’t have much to say.

Fast forward to September I was walking through her yard and came across this soppy wet area and my first initial thought was it was sewage. -It was not. It was water. Her handyman, just a local guy that isn’t certified but charges a “service call fee” of $25 every time he is called. She had also told me previously that this guy charges her ungodly amounts for him to do anything for her. He dug up areas all over to fix what was now the problem as to why the water pressure was nonexistent. This handy man supposedly “fixed” this issue. He again did not. I have pictures of areas that after he fixed it began to pool up with water because there was another crack in the waterline somewhere. So this is clearly an issue that this handyman can not fix or had no business doing so in the first place. 

The winter came and the water situation was the same. I knew there was nothing she could do because the ground was frozen at that point. Mind you this whole time I could not shower, dishes or laundry. I was spending the days I worked at a friends so I could shower. I reminded her in January when I paid rent about the water issue again to which she acted surprised by this news. She said she couldn’t do anything until spring. Now this spring is here and she was supposed to fix this and she isn’t. I ended up getting ahold of the department of agriculture trade and consumer protection agency and explained the whole situation and in her response she lied about everything. Because of that they couldn’t determine who was telling the truth so I was advised to get a lawyer. 

Someone told me to call the health department to have them come out and they did. But because there was enough water pressure to flush the toilet then it wasn’t a health issue so they couldn’t do anything further. Since I contacted these agencies she’s been on a course to get me out of here. 

There is not even enough water pressure to turn the shower on. It barely trickles when the shower head is turned on. I have videos of all of this. 

My question is is there a certain gallon per minute that a rental has to have to be up to code for it to be a fit and safe place to rent? 

All I’m trying to do is be able to take a shower, do laundry and dishes in my home and not feel like I’m camping 24/7. I should just move out but I am told she can’t retaliate against me for speaking up about these issues. 

I really hope I explained this situation enough. It’s just a sad situation and I’m also grieving with the loss of my significant other who suddenly died a few months ago. The landlord can not afford the property and has done absolutely no maintenance on it in the whole time I was here. Since his death she has left notes upon notes on my door every time I leave. Asking for rent early. Reminding me that rent is due in a cpl weeks. One time she had cleaning estimates for my place that she is charging me if rent isn’t paid on the first. All the while doing nothing to fix the issues. 

There has to be a building code that each rental in Wisconsin has to abide by to be suitable for a place to rent. Who do I call and have this tested?


I also have videos of the water trickling out of the faucet if anyone wants to grasp the seriousness of this situation.",reddit,general madison

"You’re ignoring basic economics. Population growth alone increases demand, and avocados are way more popular now than in the ‘90s, thanks to trends like avocado toast, guac on everything, and the push for healthier diets. Even if demand had stayed the same (which it didn’t), inflation alone would have driven up prices. A $2 avocado in 1990 is **$4.79** today just from inflation, before even considering supply chain costs, labor, or increased consumption. Acting like California was the only thing keeping prices down is laughably wrong. If anything, Mexico supplying 90% of the avocados in the U.S. is the only reason prices aren’t even higher.

"La Crosse native here. Charmant Hotel has a rooftop bar that overlooks downtown and the river, and might be open depending on weather. It's a really lovely place to be at sunset. They also have a great brunch indoors with a river/park view.

A smaller, cozier option for brunch/lunch is The Damn Tasty on the Northside. HIGHLY recommend their Kimchi Toast, but everything on the menu is amazing.

If you're into beer, 608 Brewery has a lot of experimental brews, heavy on the hoppy and sour varieties. Pearl Street Brewery and Turtle Stack are also nice options.

The Pearl Ice Cream Parlor downtown is set up as an old fashioned ice cream shop and they make their products in house. You may even catch them making waffle cones out on the floor.

The Hatchery is a cool little boutique hotel with a bar and lounge that opened up late last year. Right on the confluence of the three rivers at the north end of Riverside Park. 

If you enjoy outdoors, we've got a ton of great hiking trails up in the Bluffs that offer gorgeous views, especially with fall colors. 

About a half hour north of the city is Perrot State Park in Trempealeau, and the hike up Brady's Bluff is also great, though it can be a little tough for less active folks due to the elevation gain. The Trempealeau Hotel in town is a great place to eat and catch live music. A few minutes north of there, you can find Elmaro Vineyard and Eckers Apple Farm, which always has live music and food trucks in their beer garden area.

"If you're okay with going downtown, which is less busy in the summer I'd do some of these things.

Dublin Square - try the big square cheese curds. Their food is delicious 

Bodega Pub - Have a long island iced tea before it gets too busy. Usually a friendly crowd too

Riverside Park - I know you mentioned not much walking but there used to be a beautiful garden that was a short trek there 

Here's some random outside activities that don't involve hiking the bluffs.

Our Lady Guadalupe Shrine - Beautiful place to see with many stops but also a hike to see it all

Grandad Bluff - Drive up to the top and experience a beautiful view from the top. See UWL and the entire city 

The Great Escape - If you like an escape room this would be a cool idea for you and yours to check out

Farmers Market on 4th St Fridays - this used to happen when I lived there. Someone used to make the best egg rolls in the world there

Linda's Bakery (West Salem) but totally worth the drive. The smell when you walk in and the friendly service.

Quick Winona ideas:
Bloedow Bakery (Winona) one of my favorites. Try the bacon and maple long john 
Sugar loaf is a beautiful place to explore as well.

I'd recommend coming in either on Cty Rd KK to 13th street off of 11/81 or via 17th street (16th is pretty good, too) off of 69. Then plan to approach 20th Ave from either direction and then look for what's available and close.

If you're coming from Milwaukee, like me, there's just simply no location in Madison that isn't safe. It's insane to me that a 1 bedroom at 1300 qualifies as affordable rent, especially if the rooms look comfortable. I think if you do research, those sorts of places are about middle of the road in terms of quality. I have a good friend that lives down the street on the west side for 1300. It's obviously not granite countertops, but it's quiet, walkable to woodmans, and has a nice wooded view in the back.

"Overall general advice: If you want a college/gameday experience Regent Street and the end of State Street closer to campus are what you will want. If you want a more adult experience the square, King Street, or the blocks of State Street closer to the capitol are great.

Williamson Street (which locals call Willy St) and Atwood are further out but have a lot of cool bars and restaurants. These areas embody what a lot of people think of when they think ""Madison"" They're east side, hippy type neighborhoods. They are what State Street was 20-30 years ago.

On Willy St - [Weary Traveler](https://wearytravelerfreehouse.com/) is fantastic. [I/O Arcade Bar](https://ioarcade.bar/) is a ton of fun and, if you are there during the day, [Meep Meepleton's World of Fun](https://www.meepmeepletons.com/) is nearby - perfect place for 40 somethings like you and me to relive their youth.

A couple blocks off of Willy St - [Working Draft Beer Company](https://www.workingdraftbeer.com/) has some of the best beer in Madison. [Giant Jones](https://giantjones.com/) is a small, no frills place with delicious higher alcohol content beer. [Stateline Distillery](https://www.statelinedistillery.com/) has excellent cocktails.

Monroe Street is also worth a visit. It's a bit more fancy than other areas (think, Trader Joes, yoga studios, etc.) but also has some fun businesses and restaurants.

UW has two student unions. Memorial Union (the one people mean when they say ""The Union"") is on Lake Mendota and is a definite must visit. Grab a brat, burger, beer, Babcock ice cream, etc. and enjoy a seat by the lake. Union South is the newer union closer to Camp Randall.

Moderate adjustment for me, going to be a wicked one for you, is the winter wind chill. I grew up with a lot of snow, but not crazy wind. Out in the midwest it's super windy. And it bites when it drops below freezing. 

Not an adjustment for me, but going to be a huge one for you in a good way is the weather. As others have said, we deal with 4 months of shit weather to pay for the amazing summer weather. I'd bet we have a solid 3 months a year where we top out in the upper 70s to low 80s, and drop down into the 60s at night. They aren't all at once - a few in April, bunch in May, couple here and there J-J-A, more in Sept, etc. But those days are just glorious. And the seasonal changes are wild. 120 degree temp swings from height of summer to depth of winter. You can't mass the passing of time, there are real, hard seasonal cycles. 

Madison is a very small city, but it's got almost one of everything you want in a city, and has like 90% less problems than a real city. No real crime, rush hour is like 30 minutes tops, etc. Pick your favorite suburb of Seattle and that's sort-of Madison. 

Our farm to table partnership is the real deal. Tons of very good and fairly reasonably priced restaurants are around the area, and most have a chalkboard inside the door listing the farms they partner with. 

Related, Madison is surrounded by farms and nature. Start at the capitol, drive 20 minutes in any direction, and you're past the suburbs and into the country. And we ran some bike trails out there that crisscross the city, so you can just hop on your bike anywhere and be biking out in the country in under an hour. 

Regarding the mosquitos: https://www.teepublic.com/sticker/33998210-giant-mosquito-warning-sign. I jest, but I've definitely been chased out of the arboretum because I forgot my bug repellent. Chased by a cloud. A very spicy cloud.

Coffee:

[Wonderstate](https://wonderstate.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqB2k15g9lEZxtsmb9Y3Hwfpc5KYA7IY6NeDLzrwnw0n1naa1UJ) and [Michelangelo's](https://www.michelangeloscoffeehouse.com/) are both great local shops. Colectivo has neat locations but I always find their coffee too bitter.

Lunch:

[The Mediterranean Cafe](https://www.medcafemadison.com/#8), inexpensive and really good

[Cooper's Tavern](https://www.thecooperstavern.com/), The food is above average quality and it has nice outdoor seating directly across from the capitol.

[Stadium Takeout](https://stadiumtakeout.com/) is near Camp Randall. Awesome Italian Beefs.

Bars: I listed a lot of bars already but here's some that are walking distance from where you are staying...

[State Street Brats](https://statestreetbrats.com/) has been around forever. Is it a great bar? No. Does it serve great food? No. Is it jam packed with college kids? Yes. If you're looking for a sports bar with local flavor that's walking distance from where you're staying, this is probably your best bet. The [Echo Tap](https://www.echotapmadison.com/) is also a solid choice with a bit of an older (ie not college aged) crowd. It should be nice enough that they'll have their covered patio open.

[Pauls Club](https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fpaulsclub%2F%3Fhl%3Den&amp;is_from_rle) is a nice blend of college bar and a more chill bar.

[Youngblood Beer Company](https://www.youngbloodbeerco.com/) is just off the capitol square on King St. Excellent beers and tasty bar snacks.

[Settle Down Tavern](https://www.settledownmadison.com/) is a cool place with super friendly staff and excellent smash burgers.

On game day all the bars on Regent Street will have fenced off areas outside with beer/brats/etc. If you  
are looking for the most ""game day tailgating"" experience this is probably where you'll want to be.

The above suggestions are certainly not exhaustive. There's a lot of great places here.

I'll go the other direction and name a few places that will likely come up in online guides as ""Must tries!"" that I would avoid...

Short Stack Eatery - extremely overhyped, expensive and run by people that have been widely accused of stealing wages while running GoFundMes to keep their business afloat. [Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/15hzbw3/how_is_shortstack_in_financial_trouble_again/)

"**DO NOT** post any personally identifiable information and do not describe the item (or post a picture) in a way that could be used for someone to claim an item that is not theirs.

**DO** leave a comment with `!resolved` if the item is reunited with its owner, that way the flair can be updated with ""Resolved"".

# Lost or Found Something?

**General Advice:** People generally retrace their steps looking for their lost item, so if you found it in a building, the lost and found is a good bet. Not sure where the lost and found is? Building managers are in charge of lost and founds and a list of building managers can be found [here](https://facilities.fpm.wisc.edu/building-contacts/) (use the search and use the primary contact).

**Something of value:** UW Police have a lost and found for items of significant value (cell phones, laptops, cash, etc). They will try to reach out if there is personally identifiable information.

**Wiscard:** Any ID card that is found should be immediately forwarded to the Wiscard Office at Union South. Anyone looking for a lost card can call (608) 262-3258 to see if the card has been turned in. For information on how to suspend a lost card [click here](https://wiscard.wisc.edu/id-card/suspend-a-lost-wiscard/).

**Phone:** UW Police is the best option, even if you are able to contact the owner directly, as they make for a safe handoff.

**Drivers License:** Yes putting it in a mailbox will get it returned to the address on card, but that address may be out of date or out of state. To get someone's drivers license back to them as soon as possible, UW Police is the best option. They have additional resources to find and return to its owner.

Things like this HAPPEN in these industries &amp; if that’s gonna ruin your day and attitude towards other people you aren’t cut out for this kinda job in my opinion. 

Also, the drink screens change every three seconds and its overwhelming the amount of different slides there are- surely it would be much more cost and time efficient to have at least one big list SOMEWHERE since I have to sit and wait 5-10 minutes until the menu returns to what I was interested in again &amp; I can finally order. Super inefficient &amp; if you look away for a SECOND you have to wait all over again if you miss the slide you wanted to see. 

Anywho, i’ve never seen people bring this up so excuse my little rant. Regardless of how I’m treated I will always tip well because I know how low people in these industries get paid - maybe not handsomely as that kind of tip from me needs to be earned. But if i’m consistently having a bad time, I simply won’t go back. Which is exactly what happened. Sucks because they do host some pretty cool acts, but the vibes are always off to me and managing that falls heavily on the shoulders of the establishment. I don’t wanna shame anyone for having a bad day or anything, but I hope they see this post &amp; realize that they aren’t hiding their disdain for their position as well as others do. None of us like to work, capitalism is a disease, but why do you gotta try to make me miserable too when im just out trying to have a good time?

"I grew up in a suburb (before it really became a suburb, it was rural and had farmland) and likewise thought it was a hellscape. I always thought I’d galavant across the globe and live in NYC or Europe. I stayed and went to Marquette but unfortunately graduated from grad school during the Great Recession and there weren’t a lot of job options. Like I had a Masters degree and worked in retail and focused hard on survival. 

After focusing hard on my career and (not having any fun) I was able to afford my first house at age 25 in Milwaukee and got my first corporate job at 27. I bought my second house in Wauwatosa and decided the suburbs were not for me anymore and bought my third house on the East Side at 32.

I’ve been able to travel to all the great places I’ve wanted to experience and have worked at a company that required me to spend 40% of the year in Atlanta. I fell in love with the outdoors and realized that Milwaukee truly has a lot to offer. We have the most beautiful Lake Michigan shoreline of any other city on the Great Lakes (since it’s almost all parks). Our summers literally can’t be beat — we have festivals every single weekend. Our weather is mild and not SUPER hot like everywhere else. Winters by the lake are also extremely mild (thanks Milwaukee Shield!). I love beer and I can’t get enough of our wonderful beer culture (although this does have its drawbacks). We have a baseball park that is easy to get to on foot (if you live downtown). It’s quick and easy to get to the airport and you can get down to Chicago in no time. Our traffic is a LOT less terrible than Chicago, Boston and Atlanta. Our Zoo is amazing! We’re not far from camping or hiking. Things that are kitschy like “Summerfest is stupid the lineups suck and it’s not Electric Forest” albeit sometimes true require a mindset shift. Summerfest is awesome if you embrace it for how groundbreaking it was and how truly Milwaukee it is!

As an adult, you have to assess the things that are important to you. For me, waking up every day and driving or going on my daily walk passed the Lake is a calming feeling that I’ve never experienced elsewhere other than when I visit the ocean. Would I move in a heartbeat? Maybe. Do I love Milwaukee enough to stay here a while longer? Absolutely!",reddit,downtown

"The Musky is a go-to for my husband and I usually when we are child free for an evening. We have started bringing our kid with us on the occasional evening for Hanks and only felt comfortable doing so in the last year or so entirely due to his age. A couple years ago he would have been one of the ferals running amok. Now that he is more mature, he's great about hanging at a booth/table, enjoying his burger, and just vibing. A few weeks ago, one of the rooms was rented out for a party and there were kids running through the bar like it was an open playground while parents ignored them and partied. That kind of behavior we won't tolerate with our kid, I wish others showed the same level of responsibility. We know one of the owners, and when we told them we had started bringing our kid to the bar, they went on a rant about how they are seeing an increase of kids in the bar that are not being monitored or managed by parents. They were brainstorming ideas on what to do about it because they consider it unsafe and a detriment to the vibe while also acknowledging that it has increased since bringing in Hanks. They don't want to make it 21+ only but certainly wants to ... I guess control it? As an aside, I've never experienced an issue with the dogs in the bar.

If I had a kid starting out I would advise - find a place where gentrification is not yet entering terminal end stages as it is here and where young people/creative class and other adventurous souls have already started the process of restoring/ reclaiming/ repurposing old buildings and there's some essential amenities like good coffee, good bar + food, some arts/music  but housing costs are still way less than here.  Some neighborhoods of Milwaukee and any number of other midwest rust belt cities come to mind. Lately Ive heard some good things about Racine of all places, from two separate sources.

I wish this city would shift gears and focus on truly affordable (where are the single room occupancy efficency apts for young people that we used to have back in the day).  And on housing where owners can build equity (e.g. cohousing, condo assns etc.)  The other part of the picture is to recognize we just cant be all things to all people.

"1. As a college town with lots of STEM businesses, Madison has plenty of nerds. Perhaps it’s my own selection bias, but the only trouble I have with finding people to play D&amp;D with is that *too many* people want to join.

2. Madison is about as safe as cities get. I’ve lived here eight years and had one acquaintance that was robbed and one acquaintance that had their car broken into. Mugging, by my reckoning, is not a regular occurrence.

3. I’d just recommend not living too close to UW campus since the students can be rowdy and frat boys are notoriously loathsome.

4. Weed is decriminalized and de facto legal even if it’s still not legalized at the state level.

5. Yes, we have Walmart. Living in or around the city proper, you won’t have to drive more than 30 minutes for any basic needs. I live within 5 minutes of multiple grocery stores: Kroger, MetCafe, CostCo, Target, Woodmans. We got options.

6. One fun aspect of Madison is that the stand-up comedy scene (apparently) is way better than in other similarly-sized cities. Lots of big names do shows here and there’s always a good show to see at the club downtown. Additionally, the aforementioned college town + STEM industry combination means that there’s lots of bright folks that live around here; I’d connect this to the strong blue-lean in our voting record and rich history of fervent protest. Additionally, the lakes provide some great opportunities for outdoor fun in the summertime; renting jet skis is a blast. We’ve got great state parks in the area as well as a free zoo downtown.

7. Only downsides, from my perspective, are the winter weather (which is getting milder and milder each year 😢) and The Beltline (the main highway ringing the city). If you’re from NJ, I’m sure you’ll be right at home on The Beltline during rush hour, so perhaps that’s not a deterrent to you.

"@HotDish420 Although it’s rather small, your digital trail is visible to the public (shout out to Reddit), so I decided to follow it &amp; glad I did because HOLD UP!!! This is too fucking good. 


okay….so…you’re telling ‘me’….you are a bartender at a bar that you OWN. And as an owner of a bar….you turned to Reddit…to ask people whose reading comprehension is most likely below average….for new restaurant recommendations. and your way of asking for new recommendations… is by making a post asking how hard a very specific restaurant has fallen off, listed multiple complaints, and ended it asking if anyone has noticed. 

So you don’t trust people to be able to comprehend what you have to say, but you trust their opinion when it comes to restaurant recommendations? Trying to see something here….

Seems to me like the inability to comprehend what youre actually trying to say……is perhaps because you never actually said “i’m looking for new recommendations” and expect people to just magically know that’s what you really meant by asking if anyone else has noticed a decline in quality at a single restaurant vs generalizing? 

And now you want to put the energy &amp; time into suing the sidewalk —because you were probably not paying attention, probably on your phone, reading &amp; re-reading all of the things strangers on reddit have to say so you can feel validated and special— and while you were not paying attention, a random guy witnessed your sidewalk exchange and now you feel stupid and embarrassed so now justice must be served. and you’re confident you’ll win because your family has a history of winning when it comes to suing sidewalks? 

you have 2 visible posts— one is a glorified Yelp review and the other is about trying to get a statement from a stranger who witnessed you being clumsy/inattentive more or less…to strengthen your case for suing the sidewalk? So you  didn’t think to complain to the city all the times you avoided falling, despite knowing the dangers the sidewalk holds, but the one time you happen to fall, you decide you’re gonna sue? You sound like a spoiled brat who can’t take “no” for an answer lol.

We’re pretty far past that now. Doctor and pharmacy either blaming each other and/or the state, no one seems to know what’s going on. They told me they’ve re-sent the paper work many times. I finally called the consortium last week who told me to call the number on the back of my insurance card. Once I finally got to a real person on that end, he told me they’ve never received anything from my doctor at all. I shared this with my docs office and they began the process again. Now it’s been another week of the same song and dance. I’m a college student and finals week is coming up, needless to say I’ve been struggling to keep afloat this semester through this mess and I’m terrified for the coming weeks.

"Hello,



As a lifelong Racinian, I can answer some of your questions.



The City of Racine has had its problems with violent crime. But there has been a decrease in major issues and nearly all offenses are for drugs.



It pretty much depends on neighborhood, because there are pockets of decent areas, while others are not so decent.



The villages of Caledonia, Sturtevant, Mount Pleasant are in relatively in the same area, so you could try those places as well.



Winter is comparable to Chicago.



The worst winter months are probably between December to late February, early March.



As for golf, there are dozens of golf courses in Southeast Wisconsin, with some high end.



Lake Geneva: Geneva National

Delavan: Delbrook, Lake Lawn

Racine: Meadowbrook Country Club, Browns Lake Golf Course (Burlington), Rivermoor Country Club (Waterford).

Kenosha: Brighton Dale Links, Bristol Oaks Country Club, Strawberry Creek.

Elkhorn: Evergreen Country Club

The Racine Unified School District serves the City of Racine and surrounding areas. In honesty, RUSD hasn’t been what it used to be when I went there more than 20 years ago. 



If you are seeking a good school, there is a thing called open enrollment, and have friends who have sent their children to Union Grove High School (about 25 minutes from the middle of Racine), or Oak Creek. 



Food: Racine is known as the Kringle capitol of the nation with many bakeries selling the delicious pastries. 



Nightlife: During the warm months, there is Party on the Pavement in downtown Racine, and know many people who go the Franksville Craft Beer Garden (food trucks, children’s play areas, live entertainment).



Milwaukee is only 30 minutes away and they have many cultural events, as well as the popular Summerfest, which draws some key music headliners.",reddit,downtown
"Do this in late June: 

Fly into Milwaukee and do a couple days of Summerfest. Giant music festival. Sunburned and annoyingly drunk crowd, but it’s big time music at a pretty good multi-stage lakeside venue! The city has an incredible foodie scene. Quietly one of America’s best. Catch a Brewers game and tailgate experience with some locals—the r/Milwaukee folks will hook you up. Milwaukee Public Market for a lunch. Copps Frozen Custard.

Drive to Madison and spend a couple days there. So much to do in Madison-good music scene at the Sylvee, Breese Field, etc. Don’t miss an afternoon in New Glarus and the brewery there. Eat at the Glarner Stube for the state’s best German-Swiss cuisine (crowded field but it stands out). Get cheese at Fromagination and take a picnic to Olin Park. Maybe find a cheese event like the World Dairy Expo. When you see a cheese shop anywhere on this trip—stop and ask what they do better than anyone else and get it and eat it how they recommend (eg. if they say put it on a cannibal sandwich just fn do it. Get pizza from Salvatore’s and take it to the Biergarten at Olbrich Park — they sometimes have great folk music on the weekends. Do NOT miss ice cream at the Babcock Hall Dairy Store on campus. Tour the state Capitol. Hike out Picnic Point. The best supper club in WI (hot debate) is Ishnala in Lake Delton—evening trip from Madison.

Hike at Devils Lake State Park
Dinner at the Driftless Cafe (the best farm to table with the best ingredients and care for the industry-chef is host of Wisconsin Foodie and he brings the best of the state to his operation) in Veroqua
Spend the night in La Crosse

Drive to Duluth-Superior. Fantastic foodie city. Love Creamery for ice cream (one of the best anywhere), Northern Waters Smokehouse for smoked fish and salami and the very best lunch sandwiches. Beer at Earth Rider is one of WI’s best (crowded field so that’s high praise).

Leave Duluth for Amnicon Falls State Park. Eat fish fry of the freshest whitefish anywhere in the world from Fisherman’s Hideout in Cornucopia.

That night stay at the Rittenhouse Inn in Bayfield—fantastic breakfast there. Here you visit the Lake Superior shore. See the Sea Caves. Take a sailboat around the Apostle Islands. Take the ferry to Bob’s Burned Down Bar on Madeline Island - quirky and nothing else really like it anywhere. Beautiful island. Walk the beach and boardwalk at Big Bay State Park.

One day and night in Green Bay. Mike’s Bakery for Kringle. Visit the Packers Hall of Fame and tour Lambeau Field. 

Spend a couple nights in Door County. White Gull Inn in Door County for fish boil and for their brunch - stay there too. Quaint and beautiful village of Fish Creek on the Green Bay (“Bay Side”) of the Door Peninsula. All of Door County is beautiful. Explore all the views at a peninsula State Park.

For outdoor activities on/around campus, check out Hoofers - they have a website. They are a popular student group and do lots of group things such as sailing, climbing, skiing. Plenty of people are active around campus, whether jogging the lakeshore path or neighborhoods, playing various sports, hiking the arboretum, etc. 

Attending the school’s sports games is also big (football, basketball, volleyball, hockey are all very well attended), as is the party/bar scene, both of which happen mostly on campus and are walk/bike/bus-able. Same goes with their amazing farmers market up on the capitol square. Or just hanging out on State street.

"Aspiring electrical apprentice looking to relocate to a cheaper state similar to mine Hey, guys! To be as succinct as possible, I am originally from New Hampshire, and I am considering a move to Wisconsin due to our prohibitively expensive cost of housing throughout the New England region. This is especially a problem because I am only a gig courier and struggle to stay afloat while incurring wear and tear on my car. Rent is disproportionately my largest expense and at roughly $900 a month after bills. To offer perspective, I am renting a room with three other people in arguably one of the most undesirable neighborhoods in my entire state; this is no exaggeration. Our housing situation is grim and has left me in a state of despair.

Although I am pursuing an electrical apprenticeship that will address this high housing cost in the long term, I struggle to figure out how to account for this cost while working at near minimum wage in the medium term. I wish not to burn myself out with additional work while undergoing schooling to simply account for cost of rent.

**I am looking for a cheaper state that is culturally and climatically similar to New Hampshire.** We embrace winter and have a culture of self-reliance, social responsibility, and minding our own business. **I am considering a state that might provide a greater chance of upward mobility and financial flexibility while I establish myself in the electrical trade.**

For my first question, **which area within the state would provide the most work opportunities** ***and*** **financial relief?** Although I wish to steer away from metropolitan living, I know Milwaukee might be an obvious answer. I will not consider Madison proper due to an apparent housing situation that is near-identical to ours, though a commute from a cheaper area is certainly possible. What other areas should I consider? I do have a very good friend out in Stevens Point and am interested in checking out this area as well, but it doesn’t appear that many work opportunities exist out that way. Nevertheless, I am planning to travel around the state to see if I truly wish to proceed with a permanent move, so feel free to drop some names of places.

Lastly, **does anyone have an idea as to how much an electrical apprenticeship pays on average in Wisconsin to start?** I would like to determine whether these jobs would pay enough to be worth incurring the risk of pursuing a four-year, legally orchestrated career plan a thousand miles away from home.

"Given the price range you mention and the love for the outdoors, I would say either La Crosse or Eau Claire.  La Crosse is in the Driftless (same as western Madison area and the rest of southwest Wisconsin), with tons of outdoor hiking and the bluffs along the Mississippi are gorgeous.  Eau Claire has a lot going for it as well with parks and places to eat.  It is also close to the Twin Cities, so it is a quick drive for a more urban environment.  I would say Eau Claire is safer than La Crosse in regard to crime if that is something you are interested in.  Also, the shopping is better in Eau Claire than it is in La Crosse.  La Crosse has this interesting blend of feeling small town and more urban at the same time.  It is also at the halfway point between the Twin Cities and Madison, (2.5 hours either way) so if you feel like taking a drive, to something more urban, it is an option, but not a convenient as Eau Claire.  Atmosphere wise, the biggest difference between the two is that Eau Claire is sprawled out and people for the most part keep to themselves.  La Crosse is wedged between the bluffs and the river, so it's more compact, but there are little cubby holes everywhere where things are squirreled away that one can go looking for and people are generally more social, which is why the bar scene is so big in La Crosse. (Also, Eau Claire technically has two downtowns.  One by the campus and is for the college students, vs one for the townies/adults on the other side of the river). Regardless, making around $80k a year will put you in a comfortable spot in either city.",reddit,downtown
"I can't speak to the recent scene, but...

I moved to Seattle from Madison (where I lived for most of time growing up), still have family in Madison so I still visit regularly.

You are not prepared for how horrible the mosquito situation is in comparison to Seattle. I couldn't believe a place as rainy, temperate as Seattle didn't have the mosquito problem we did.  Anecdote --while waiting for the bus to get to my job, I waited 10 whole minutes, I got 17 bites on my legs, through my jeans. 

However...Madison is wonderful. Amazing autumns, many more deciduous trees than Seattle, so the foliage is decidedly great (and oh my gosh, go to Devil's Lake!). Definitely more distinct seasons than rainy/darker to warm/light we have in Seattle. 

Pretty good food thanks to it being a college town. Punches above its weight class. Though of course the fresh seafood situation is not as great, good local fish available. I don't eat it, but prepare for my friends/family. Great local produce (as a vegetarian THIS is great). And yes, great cheese. I adore of the cheese section of Woodman's East. The farmer's market is amazing. I always found the local farmer's markets in Seattle to be pitiable in comparison. Also the prices are GREAT! I always have to stop myself from buying everything, and trying somehow to take it back. 

Oh and because there is a state income tax, and higher proportionally property taxes (though property values are lower, so you can actually afford a decent house in Madison still --at least in comparison to Seattle) no more WA/Seattle/King county sale taxes! And they also don't tax most food in grocery stores, so that's good.

Although buying alcohol is still wacky. I don't remember if you're old enough to remember the WA state liquor stores, but like that...only worse. (thanks Tavern League!) 

Good transit system, GREAT bike paths. Loved biking around Lake Monona. People are nice, maybe a bit too nice if you've always appreciated the ""Seattle freeze"" as I did because you're an introvert, but I imagine it's not too intrusive for most people.

There are tons of things available through the UW, which is so much better than the UWub. Hanging out at the terrace is great. 

I hope you like humidity, because Judas Priest the summers are unbearably hot and humid! so humid. It's why I refuse to go back to Madison in the summer. I am not a fish. Though at least because they know it's hot, they have decent air conditioning, and it's everywhere. Which I know you know, Seattle still lacks (let's acknowledge climate change guys!) 

The winters are colder and drier. Now I personally love the winters in WI. My fave season as I love snow, and cold (like I root for windchills). Also despite the sadly more occasional snows (see also: climate change), it's less dark during the day. It's noticeably further South. So it isn't only light only between 9am and 3pm during winter.  So if the winter dark bothers you about Seattle, there is less of that in Madison. Conversely the summer's aren't AS light as Seattle, which is fine because I find the amount of light during the summer to be creepy. 

Lots of erudite people in Madison. Due in part no doubt to the whole college/people not moving after going to college thing. Political situation in Madison is pretty much still the same as Seattle (for good or ill), though less homeless people, but the state is Redder. So if you're a woman or LGBTIA + Madison is okay, but many state laws are not good. Repubs Gerrymandered themselves into control before I left, and that hasn't changed yet. We'll see if WI get new maps (go Susan Crawford!) 

Anyhew, just my rambly thoughts as someone who did the opposite journey. I really do love Madison, and think it's a great place to live. I mean I wouldn't leave the PNW for it, but that's just in comparison for me personally (I hate the heat/humidity/mosquito thing, and I like more legal protections).",reddit,monona

"Potentially getting dropped. Scared and Lost I had a very bad semester in the spring, especially due to a major toll on my mental health at the end especially due to an extreme family event. I ended up dropping Calc 1 and getting very poor grades putting me on probation. This semester I retook calc 1, but I ended up dropping it again because I just couldn't understand it, can't explain why but it just never clicked. It demoralized me a ton and combined with a complete lack of passion for my current major I got into a rut. This led to a lot of introspection on why Im here and what I want to do, which fast forward time and a meeting with my advisor, has led to me completely changing my major to something Im genuinely interested in. (Still in L&amp;S but to a very different field and one I've dabbled in similar classes too and have done very well in) But in the meantime I've put myself in a bad situation.

As it stands, I've got a 4 credit and two 3 credit classes. I'm going to fail the 4 credit, no matter how good I did on the final I cannot pass even with a 100. I got an AB on one 3 credit. Meaning I have to get a C or higher to get above the 1.5 gpa to avoid suspension. I'm 80% confident I've gotten the C (already took final) but just don't know til the grades get in.

With all that info in mind, if I don't get the 1.5 what are my options? I've already contacted my academic counselor via email about the options a week ago, but haven't heard back. I really don't want to be suspended for an entire year and don't feel like it would help my academics at all. I know the UW website says major changes aren't a viable reason to appeal, but I feel like my declined mental health and low effort in classes is due to the classes I was taking, so I'm not sure how to show I've solved that issue if they don't see it as a valid reason.

I'm lost as what I can do if I get suspended besides being forced to take the year off or seek out a new place of education.",reddit,general madison

Instead of them just sending a prescription to Costco, I have to call ahead and pick up a written prescription in person, and then hand it to the Costco pharmacy and wait for it to be filled.

"Job Offer on Racine, I have some questions for y'all  Hi there,

I have a job offer to move to Racine WI for work, however I have never stepped foot into Wisconsin and have zero idea what life is like in Wisconsin.  I have heard good things about the WI in general but I have a few specific questions that I can't seem to find the answers to on the Google Machine.

First, by way of search it seems like Racine is relatively safe. It also seems to be a suburb almost to Milwaukee.  Is this true?  If so, do most folks travel in/out by way of the Milwaukee Mitchell airport?  This is important as I have zero family in WI and have a new born, so I need a decent airport for having family to visit.

Second, I grew up in FL, so winters aren't my favorite.  However, I have lived in a few states that have winter, such as Colorado and TN, but never spent time in the Midwest.  Are they super cold and gray or is it fairly sunny?  Also assume that winters are long there and the snow, once it falls really never goes away.  Would you compare it to Chicago in the winter?  I ask, as i have some experience with that as a kid and gives me a reference point.  What are the worst/best months weather wise?

Third, how's the golf scene?  I play competitive golf (state ams and such) so this is a fairly important thing for me, as it is my outlet.  It seems like there are a few golf courses in Racine and Wisconsin in general is know for some really great golf course, but how about the area around Racine?

Next, is schools and cost of living.  What does gas currently cost?  Looking on Zillow, house pricing seems to be reasonable, but there is also a wide range of hone prices from low 200s to 500+s.  Any recommendations for a good area to live, with a decent school, within a 30 min drive to downtown Racine?

Lastly, is good.  How is the food and drink scene? My wife and I, both mid 30s, love to eat and try new places and new food.  This is one of our favorite things to do and thus hoping this area has some good food for evenings out.

Appreciate the feedback and I look forward to visiting the area personally in the next week or so to determine if this opportunity is the right one for my family and I.  Please feel free to share anything else you might find important or helpful about Racine or Wisconsin.

"I bought a founding membership, it was cheap before they opened and I figured, with heaters I could use it all year and it was closer to me on the Northside vs Vitense on the opposite side of town.  I love VItense, but this seemed to make sense.  

A few observations as a member who regularly visited. 

\- The heaters were small and not powerful enough. Some bays were in the gaps between the heater and would not get warm at all. Depending on wind, it would be brutal in the cold.  Vitense heaters above your head were large and powerful. I could easily feel comfortable at VItense in teens weather but not at Pinseekers.

\-The platforms were super narrow so annoying to walk to bay or exit. It was always awkward to get past seated customers.

\-This was an attempt of Top Golf but not executed in the same way.  Same Top Tracer games but not as forgiving as top golf.  The targets at Top Golf have a little funnel that if a golfer hits near it could roll in and count for a target. This made it more fun for non golfers to chip at. Pin seekers you had to hit the actual target which was maybe 5 feet in circumference and not as easy.

\-Food seemed to be good when they opened, but then quality went down.

\-Awkward music selection..a lot of times it was straight up country all night. Some of it slow music. Not the right vibe for hitting golf balls.

\-Vitense is nice because there's practice putting greens and short game area. That's lacking here. 

For $700 or whatever I paid for the year, it was a great perk to take friends and hit balls most of the time (lots of times tee times were gone). There wasn't as much flexibility as Vitense.  Some improvements may help.

I failed to move to the grass on a random north face as I approached a simple intersection with a car waiting to turn left, southbound. Tapped my brakes, attempting to go extremely light on the front, to no avail.  First time I 've been down on both wrists simultaneously on a micro-second front-wheel washout since the late '70's /early '80's.  On the day in question I think I witnessed, and bear witness to, the most perfectly laid down, even, smooth 1/8"" layer of black ice, ever.

"&gt;Why can't we have one on State St? It would absolutely kill.

I believe the explanation stated here before is that each franchise has a guaranteed territory, typically three miles radius, in which no other Culver's can appear, so downtown is too close to the other Culver's in Madison. It is claimed the territory rules can be adjusted for high population density and physical barriers such as rivers.

On the other hand, it could mean that an existing franchise owner could build a second Culver's within their own territory.

"Wisconsin natives saying ""it's not that bad"" is really just our way of gaslighting ourselves into surviving here. Because let’s be real—winter in Wisconsin is like a bad relationship. It starts off with charm (pretty snow, cozy vibes), then quickly turns toxic (black ice, frostbite, and a heating bill that personally attacks your bank account).

We get less sunlight in the winter than Texas, which means by February, we’re all just vitamin D-deficient raccoons, living off carbs and caffeine, squinting at the sky like, ""Is that… the sun? Nah, just a streetlamp.""

I don’t even like the cold. I don’t like what it does to my car, my house, or my already-questionable knees. And yet, I stay. Because the other six months? Absolutely magical. Perfect temperatures, bonfires, camping, lake days, and outdoor activities that make you forget you just spent half the year wrapped in a blanket, muttering ""never again.""

But let’s be real—Wisconsin turns you into a seasonal shape-shifter. From May to October? Social butterfly. Hiking, biking, grilling, day-drinking like there are no consequences. November hits? Boom. Crypt keeper mode. I become an indoor creature, only emerging for essential supplies (cheese, coffee, and salt for the driveway). I perfect hobbies no one asked for—bread-making, knitting, staring out the window dramatically. Socializing? Unlikely. If you see me in public between December and April, no, you didn’t.

•The quirkiness. There's just a very ""Madison"" culture here that you don't find anywhere else. I can't really articulate it, but it's like, the way people say thank you to the bus drivers, the small, quiet acts of kindness I witness, the big, sometimes obnoxious protests...I dunno. I love the culture here 

•The nature. Not only here in Madison, but I don't have to drive very far to be ""in the middle of nowhere.""

•The focus on local businesses. It's not everyone, sure, but it's certainly stronger than other places I've lived.

•The grassroots and community-based art scene. Everyone is welcome. It makes my middle-aged heart so happy when fresh college grads welcome me and other older people into their groups 

•The summer farmer's market.


Least favorites:

•The winters. Sorry friends, I know there's nothing I can do about it, and I'm not leaving, but damn I hate the cold and snow.

•Public transit. Now, I'm a big fan of the BRT. The A line has made downtown much more accessible for me and my family. I am a pretty big defender of it, even with the issues it has. But I really feel like it could be better. I lived in Japan for a while, so I'm spoiled, but I really wish we had better options.

•The politics - not because I disagree, or don't want to be politically active - but because so many politicians try to turn their campaigns into Madison vs the rest of the state, painting us like we're terrible people. Plus the constant bombardment of ads during election years is painful.

•Something not everyone can relate to, but the Bishop. I'm Catholic, and I can't stand him.

"Im gonna say on housing, if your daughter is a freshman living in the dorms, she'll be fine as far as a place. As far as yourself, its gonna be a tad harder. Downtown and anywhere thats near it is gonna be the most expensive spots in town. Now if you dont mind commuting a little bit, there are cheaper areas, but they might be a little sketchy in the city, but its not Milwaukee bad or Chicago bad (they are lower income and have drugs and may have poor housing options, but crime is nowhere near many cities its type). My recommendation is go with a suburb and commute to the city if you cant afford downtown or a nicer area of the city.

Mcfarland (where I live) is a really nice area id strongly recommend checking out. Isnt a whole lot of restaurants or shops or businesses, but what they have is really damn good for a small town its size. Angelos, Maple tree, Squirrels Nest, Spartan Pizza, Lukes to name a few (or in this case, half the places in town lol) are all really good. I always make sure to stop at the local Grace cafe, but we also have Mcfarland House too (both are local to the area). As far as shops, there really isnt much (wish we had a true downtown). You have Walgreens, Pick n Save, Kwik Trip, Dollar General, 2 BPs (that were out of gas for several months lol), and a Citgo (with a really cool owner). But almost no cute little places. And of course, if you need anything, theres Monona Walmart and Kohls nearby, as well as both Towne malls, Stoughton, and Sun Prairie within 15 minutes. Its more a bedroom town.

"Best Places to Live Near Delavan, WI on an $80k Salary? Hey everyone,

I’m moving for a new job in Delavan, WI, and looking for advice on the best places to live nearby. I currently live in Milwaukee, but I’d like to cut down my commute and move closer to work after the summer when my lease is up.

**A bit about my situation:**

* I’m a new grad with an $80k salary, and while I’m budgeting carefully, I want to live below my means. I’m aiming to spend around $1,000/month on rent.
* I’m a Black woman, and while I know Wisconsin isn’t the most diverse state, I’d love to find a culturally diverse area or at least a welcoming community.
* I’d prefer somewhere that’s safe, has a bit of a social scene or community vibe, and ideally isn’t too isolated since I’m coming from a bigger city.
* Proximity to grocery stores, gyms, and other essentials is a plus, and I’d love to have some coffee shops or restaurants nearby for the occasional treat.
* I’ll be commuting to Delavan, so anything within a reasonable drive would be great.

**My Questions:**

1. What towns or cities near Delavan would you recommend for someone in my situation?
2. Are there any hidden gems that are affordable but still have a decent vibe for young professionals?
3. Any tips on finding rentals in the area?",reddit,general madison

"I met my partner on Tinder about 6 years ago and was moderately successful in getting dates in Madison for about a year prior to that. I know the Tinder meta has probably changed somewhat, but if you're new to app-based dating here would be my tips:

**1)** Understand the goals and limits of Tinder. **Your goal is to set up a first date.** You goal is to get your match's number in no more than 15 messages and then text your match to set up a low-stakes meetup. I would suggest something like meeting up for coffee, a cocktail, or ice cream and then walking around a bit somewhere scenic. That's it.

Where a lot of people (and especially men) screw up with Tinder is expecting it to be anything other than what I have described above. It is not a social media app where you're going to have long conversations with your match. It is not Onlyfans, and I guarantee your match doesn't want to receive lewd or suggestive messages. It is, broadly speaking, not a place where most of the users are looking to have sex on the first date.

It is simply a replacement for having a cute moment with someone while out with friends and exchanging numbers.

**2)** It's a number's game. Nobody is real until they actually show up to your date in person. You cannot allow yourself to get emotionally invested in people who aren't real.

You are going to swipe on thousands of people. You are going to match with maybe a few dozen of them. You are going to get no response from over half the people who match with you. You are going to see conversations that abruptly end or ghost you for no apparent reason. And you are probably going to get stood up on a few dates. Know this going in. Be prepared to delete a match and move on without getting worked up about it.

**3)** It's a meat market. Tinder/Hinge are very much based around immediate first-impressions and physical attraction. To that end, make sure you have *good pictures*. You are probably not as good of a photographer as you think. Your college photos are probably not as charming as you remember. Work with someone in your social circle who understands fashion and photography and get some nice (current) photos of yourself to use in your profile. If you're a man, make sure you're smiling, looking at the camera, and wearing clothes that fit your body in those pictures.

**4)** Probably controversial, but pay the money to boost yourself on the algo, especially if you're a man. I don't know how true this is anymore, but the $15/mo for Tinder Gold was a no-brainer for me back in the day. The algo will intentionally bury freemium users and put your profile in front of a wider range of more attractive people if you pay. If you think this is unfair, you're not wrong, but \*shrug\*.

**5)** You're probably worse at writing than you think. While you don't want to have long conversations on Tinder, you do need to be fun and non-threatening when you acknowledge and riff with a match. A lot of men are extraordinarily bad at this part of online dating. I have no specific advice I can give about this, except that practicing this skill is probably more important than having abs.

Hope this was helpful, good luck.",reddit,general madison

"Strictly Discs on Monroe St. you done me dirty back in 2003-2006 and now I’m calling you out online. 1st of all back in the day, Strictly Discs had an owner and an single employee who were always there. 

1st Done me Dirty- I asked if they had a copy of Bob Dylan’s Blonde on Blonde on record. Both the owner and the employee said yes, we do, just it isn’t out right now. They shuffled off and come back later with the double LP. They take out each record and look at it and say- it’s in good condition… But unfortunately for me a few weeks later, I finally go to play the 14 minute Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands and it’s skipping from a giant scratch. They either didn’t look at the Lp’s four sides and accidentally sold me the Lp with a giant scratch or lied to me. But the way they looked at the Lp’s it would be very difficult to not see it. The specifically didn’t show me the Lp’s before I bought it and did the authoritative it’s all good when the damn well should have seen the scratches. 

2nd Done me Dirty- There was a Jerry Garcia cd box set that you sold. You had a sale and sold all five cd’s for $45 instead of the the $60 full retail price. As a poor college student, I saved up my money and finally went in to buy. Unfortunately they were sold out. So I asked about the cd box set and they said they would order it for me. I ask about the price and they say $60. I ask for the sale price they had the week before. The owner says we aren’t going to carry that item anymore so it’s full price. 
I get my cd box set at full price and am quite happy… until the next time I go in and they have the Jerry Garcia cd box set for sale at $45. That was my last purchase from them ever. The owner done me dirty twice so GFY!

"Being a Non-Partisan Election Observer in Wisconsin **Quick Guide to Being a Non-Partisan Election Observer in Wisconsin**

It's been several years since I took a Carter Center training for election observers, and I was hoping to find those materials again, but unfortunately they're no longer available online. Fortunately Wisconsin does publish some good guidance, and I've provided links to some of the materials below.

Anyone can be an election observer. As a non-partisan election observer, your role is to ensure transparency and integrity in the election process. Here are few key guidelines to follow:

**1. Notify Upon Arrival**

* If it's your local polling place and you are voting, vote before you start the observer process.
* Ask to speak to the Chief Inspector. They're busy. Be patient and kind to everyone involved. It's a tough job, and a long day.
* Inform the Chief Inspector that you would like to register and serve as an observer.
   * Record their name and the time you registered.
* You will be asked to sign the observer log and provide photo identification. You must wear an ""Election Observer"" badge while in the polling place.
* You are not required to state an organizational affiliation. That said, I have experienced Election Inspectors that insist on it because there's a blank on the form. At that point I have said “The Carter Center”, or made up an organization \[Last name\] Family Center for Democracy.

**2. Follow Observation Area Rules**

* You will be placed in a designated observation area. This area must be between 3 to 8 feet from the tables where voters check-in and register.
* You should be able to see and hear the voting process, but not interfere with the flow of voters.
* Don't eat in the observation area. Generally, the election inspector won't mind if you have a coffee or bottle of water.

**3. Respect the Voting Process**

* Do not speak to voters, and avoid disrupting the election inspectors.
* Keep conversation and activity to a minimum.
* Refrain from using cell phones for calls or photography inside the polling place.
* Silent texting is allowed, but discouraged because it can be difficult to distinguish from audio and video recording.

**4. Record Observations and Report Issues Appropriately**

* Bring a notepad and writing utensils. Do not use audio recording or any form of camera.
* Observe and record the consistency with which election clerks confirm registrations, verify eligibility, and maintain the poll logs.  
* Observe and record the consistency with which election clerks respect and safeguard voter privacy.
* Observe and record how elections officials provide ballot access, support, and resources for persons with special needs.
* Observe and record how elections officials address unusual behavior of others in or near the polling place.
   * Examples include intimidation, cameras or audio recording in or outside the polling place, attempts to directly observe the qualification, registration, or eligibility verification of other voters for the purpose of influencing or intimidating or dissuading voters, attempts to directly observe the completion or submission of ballots, and or promoting candidates, parties, policies, or ballot initiatives.
      * Some of these activities can be allowable, after all, you're there as an observer. Use good judgement.
   * Patriotism is not electioneering. If someone comes in red white and blue from head to toe, just be happy they're wearing clothes and are having a good day.
* Direct any questions or concerns to the chief inspector immediately, but in a manner that does not disrupt their responsibilities.
* If you believe a voter is ineligible, you may bring it to the attention of the chief inspector, but as an observer you do not directly challenge voters.
* If you believe an eligible voter is being wrongfully denied the ability to cast their ballot, you may bring it to the attention of the chief inspector.

**5. Election Observers may not:**

* Engage in electioneering
* Video and still cameras are not allowed
* Handle official election documents
* Have conversations about candidates, parties, referenda, or ballot questions
* Make calls / use cell phones for voice calls inside the polling area (texting or other silent usage is acceptable if it is not disruptive)
* Wear clothing or buttons related to candidates, parties or referenda that is intended to influence the election
* Interact with voters, except when requested.
* View confidential information on the poll list.
* Enter vehicles of curbside voters.

**6. In the Event That a Voter’s Eligibility Is Challenged**

* An~~yone can ask the inspector to~~  inspector may challenge the right of someone else to cast a ballot if they sincerely believe that the person does not meet the rules to vote on the basis that: they aren’t a U.S. citizen, not at least 18 years old, haven't lived in the polling area for at least 10 days, have a felony and haven’t gotten their rights back, have been judged unable to vote, or if they already voted in this election. The inspector has absolute discretion to disregard individual requests to do so. 
* As an observer, you may ask the inspector for and record the name of the individual raising the issue of a challenge. If the challenge is for the wrong reasons, the person making the challenge can face civil penalties.
* The process is detailed more thoroughly in the link to the legislative code below. 
* The inspector shall then ask only those of the following questions which are appropriate to test the person's qualifications based on the cause for the challenge:
   * (a) Are you a United States citizen?
   * (b) Are you at least 18 years of age?
   * (c) For at least the 10 days before this election, have you resided in, or been a resident of, the ward or election district from which you seek to vote?
   * (d) Are you currently disqualified from voting for any of the following reasons:
      * A felony conviction for which you are still serving probation or are on parole or extended supervision?
      * A judge's ruling that you are incapable of voting?
      * Having made a bet or wager on this election?
      * Having voted previously in this election?
   * If someone is challenged, they are required to answer the questions about their qualifications, and if they refuse to take an oath affirming their responses or to answer the questions, they won’t get a ballot. However, if they meet all the rules after answering the questions and taking an oath, they should be allowed to vote.
* The inspector should conduct the verification interview away from other voters whenever possible.
* Record everything you observe.

**7. Remain Neutral**

* Do not wear anything supporting a candidate, political party, or ballot issue.
* Your role is to observe and document the process impartially, not to influence or promote any side.

**8. You do not have to register as an election observer to observe, report, and record unusual practices and behavior at the polls.**

* You may ask for the Inspector and report any concerns you have.
* Record everything you observe and report.

By following these guidelines, you can help promote a fair and transparent election process in Wisconsin.

"Howdy, Janesville native here; lived here for about 28 of my 35 years on this planet.

I purchased my home here about 3 years ago. East side which is generally considered the nicer part of town. 280k for a 3 bed / 3 bath, 2 car garage, fenced in back yard on about 1/3rd acre, quiet street with a greenbelt for dog walks is across the street, parks within walking distance. 

Homes can vary here from million dollar, to 150k. Again, East side is generally considered the nicer part of town, but each area has its perks. 

It’s known locally as chainsville because the majority of restarts are chains unlike bigger cities; but we do have plenty of local places as well (mostly bar and grill or Mexican)

The ice age trail is well maintained and a generally nice place for hiking / biking. 

Downtown area has made some really good strides the last few years. (Farmers market, holiday events, wine walks / bar crawls)

If politics are your thing, I’d say it’s a mix, but generally leans more Dem. 

Lastly, your 25 min from the Illinois border, 40 min from Madison, and a little over an hour to Milwaukee. I include this, because Janesville is generally seen as pretty boring. Loved living in Milwaukee, but I’d much rather have the home / lot size, and peace of mind that I get here.

I had a friend introduce me to Kebab and Grill on Washington. They moved a few years ago and I think they’re near Ann street, across from where Schmidt music used to be. Wonderful Indian/Pakistani food, and the guys are so friendly too. 

Red onion at monument square is good too, I always used to go there and get soup and breakfast. 

I remember once I told a coworker at UPS that I wanted to go to sugar shack that day. He was from lake Geneva and was shocked I was going there. Then he asked if it was in Racine and I said yeah it’s the candy store downtown, not the other place in lake Geneva.",reddit,downtown

That and seeing this post finally motivated me to see if I could find an independent pharmacy to switch to.

"I quit Walgreens when a pharmacy tech, without me knowing, called my doc to say I was trying to get controlled meds illegally.


 Why? Because my friend showed up while I was in line waiting. My script was being challenged for being too early. My friend also takes gabapentin and was picking his up as well. So, after I left with him, as I was done fucking with Walgreens to get it done after 3 hours trying. 
She told my primary care I was buying scripts from people.


Now, I have to sign controlled substance forms at primary care. No big deal. But, the fucking embarrassment and violation of HIPPA was the end.


I use HyVee and couldn't be happier. Rarely any line. Always have my stuff. Nicer staff, probably because they are less stressed out at a smaller volume pharmacy.
OP  I commiserate, my dude!",reddit,general madison

"Moved here from West Palm Beach in 2015, own a home in East Towne area and I can say it’s not really as bad as some make it out to be. 

If you’ve lived elsewhere, crime here might be shockingly low in comparison to where you come from.    

This city lost its mind over I think it was 5 homicides the year I moved here, but the week I left West Palm Beach, a gang war broke out downtown and killed 7 people. 

It’s really not that bad, other than the occasional people speeding on East Washington.",reddit,downtown

"I grew up in Racine, left for college, and came back to be with family and raise one of my own. 

Racine is its own city with its own history, but it is basically a suburb of Milwaukee and Chicago. I work in Milwaukee and have neighbors who work in Racine, Milwaukee, and Chicago. Proximity to both larger cities has its benefits and drawbacks.

Having grown up here in a diverse area in house built by my great-grandfather, I’ll say I feel safe anywhere in the city. I can see how the sight of areas can make some people unfamiliar with Racine feel/seem unsafe. We built a house in a newer neighborhood and had the “Kia Boys” come through the neighborhood and steal a couple cars, something that never happened in our starter home right in Racine.

I travel a lot for work and use Mitchell (15 minute drive) as much as I can because it’s SO much more convenient than O’Hare. That said, it’s really nice to have the option of O’Hare (which is only 60 min away) pricewise and for the number of flights. 

I love winter and Racine (lately) is not cold enough or snowy enough for me. It really depends on the winter - some winters are very long and cold and snowy. Last year we had 1-2 weeks of cold (below 10° for a high) and the rest of the winter was upper 30s. Being on the west side of Lake Michigan, Racine gets warmer winters and cooler springs, similar to Chicago but maybe a little colder and more snowy. There is no spring here because of the wind off of the Lake. It’s 40-50° until mid/late June and then BAM, it’s 85° and humid as hell. 

We aren’t that into restaurants due to our super picky children, and I can see how someone into restaurants would be bored here. That said, there are some old local places I love from growing up and a few new places. Again, you’re 20 minutes drive from Downtown Milwaukee and an hour train ride from Downtown Chicago. 

Not a huge golfer myself anymore but there are plenty of nice courses within an hour drive with Whistling Straights, Blackwolf Run, Erin Hills and more within an hour and a half. Again proximity to Milwaukee and Chicago…

Schools… I went to Catholic school, which are worse than when I was growing up, but a lot friends went to public schools, which are all diverse and scare people. Public schools seem to be better than when I grew up. I have friends who went to public school and ended up at Harvard and Columbia and I know kids who went to private school and ended up in prison. 

The outdoors are great. Lakefront and beaches in Racine are amazing for 2 months we get to use them. Proximity to WI state parks is amazing. 

Having grown up here I probably think it’s better than it is, and coming from outside you may think it’s worse. There is only one other Racine native in my new neighborhood, everyone else is from Milwaukee or Chicagoland. 

Look at houses more towards 94 to make the trips to Milwaukee and Chicago better, look at houses north of the Racine Zoo for a nice neighborhood feel.",reddit,downtown
"As a cyclist in this city, though I don't think it has anything to do with bike access. I would probably take Mifflin if I had to get to that neighborhood, or cut over from the east path. Although I definitely agree that the bike lanes on Johnson are total shite and you're running the gauntlet of death with them as people don't IME drive slow on Johnson. 

Flipping them with the parking would help but then also only giving access to one side is another problem. Making it two way probably fixes a lot of the traffic issues but then drivers will absolutely lose their shit at slowing a route that allows them to avoid Washington. Same would apply to Gorham too though although slowing/reducing traffic on Gorham would be a godsend for access to Madison park. But I think those two streets are too relied upon as one way for game day campus access, so game day would get interesting. 

TBH though there really isn't a whole lot in the neighborhood to draw me to it AND the traffic on Johnson/Gorham is pretty insane and constant so it's further encouragement to avoid it. In the decade I've lived here I've only been over there a couple of times, mostly to meet friends at the Caribou. 

IMO those two reasons are the reasons I don't go to that neighborhood. So it might be reasonable to think others are like minded. Which then means businesses have to depend on locals and that neighborhood is pretty heavily off campus housing so that may be another part of the problem. 🤷🏻‍♂️",reddit,campus
"HyVee pharmacy is nice, and they can deliver your meds to you.",reddit,general madison
I used to be on that at max dosage - like 1600mg 3x/day 🤨 - getting my refills by the large bottles the pharmacy get for their 'stock' (instead of the smaller 'prescription' bottles) for years.,reddit,general madison

"I’m not really defending it, just saying my experience is vastly different. I’m also ignorant to any scummy shit corporate does, so I’m happy to learn whatever I can.

"Agreed!  The only benefits they have are hours (which are not consistent anymore, though) and fun things to shop for, lol. 

As an RN, I've dealt with many pharmacies/pharmacists on behalf of patients. And I will always tell patients to AVOID Walgreens and CVS.  I've known some very nice staff at those places, but their company polices set up dangerous situations for staff and patients. Use ANY smaller pharmacy. I don't know what side of Madison you are on, but there are numerous Hometown Pharmacy locations, any of the clinic based pharmacies are good (GHC, Dean, UW - check your insurance plan because I found out when I had Dean insurance, I could use a GHC pharmacy that was super convenient based on my work location), Fitchburg Family Pharmacy, O'Connell Pharmacy - those are just the ones off the top of my head.  Many of them will mail deliver meds too which has been fantastic for our household!",reddit,fitchburg
"I hate the Electoral College, but this is one of the rare benefits, in a national popular vote system, you'd be able to just rack up the score wherever you wanted. Essentially looking for cheaters anywhere and everywhere. A fuckup somewhere fucks it up everywhere.

With this system, you only have to check a few close calls that matter.

The ethical way to have the best of both worlds would be to give each state its weight in population, and split the EV's proportionately.  Let's say 1 million equals 2 EVs (pretty close to current ratio)

So CA just has 33M votes. And then it splits based on the % of the turnout.

Biden 11.1M Actual Votes 63.48%  would yield 20.9M ""electoral"" votes. 41.8 EVs  
Trump 6M Actual Votes 34.32% Would give 12.1M ""electoral"" votes. 24.2 Evs

So even if you manage to say, counterfeit 1M votes for Trump.  
In that scenario, Biden's now %61.3 is 20.2M votes. 40.4 EVs.  
Trumps now 38.7% is 12.7M votes, or 25.2 EVs.

So fabricating a million votes only gains 2.4 EVs since it's not winner take all, and all the damage is contained in one state.

It's like failsafe doors in a sinking ship or something.

"Look at the near East side, along East Washington Avenue, for high-rises near downtown and nightlife.

Both streets are on major bus and bike routes.",reddit,downtown
"OP, June in Madison is paradise. Book your room wherever you can, but I recommend putting yourself on a cancelation list for any downtown hotels whose rates you can stomach (they'll be crazy expensive). Talk directly to the hotel agent, and lean on your daughter's birthday! Odds are long, but it's worth it if you can get something. Being downtown that time of year is really special, the closer to the Capitol Square the better.

Also: You can call Union Cab for transport if you'd rather not Uber. You can order a timed pickup on the way to the show, and they can help you figure out the best approach for afterward.",reddit,downtown
"Suggestion: She lives in a dorm the first year. You get a 1 BR apartment on the near East Side of downtown Madison. 

I suggest you look at 1- the high-rise buildings along East Washington Avenue (aka East Wash) a few blocks from the Capital Square, or 2- the high-rise buildings overlooking Lake Monona just off the Capital Square, or 3- for a slightly funkier ambiance, places on Williamson Street (aka Willy St), which will be within 1/4 - 3/4 mile of the Capital Square. All of these are close to fun activities, cafes, bars, parks, lakes, on bus routes and bike paths.

These places are about 1/2 to 1-1/2 miles from the eastern end of campus. Great places to live that will also give your daughter space from you while she integrates into the college experience and makes friends.

"Same with Community Pharmacy. They can even coordinate  refills so you don't have to pick up as often. Sometimes they'll tell they have to order meds, but the meds are always there on the day they say they will be.

"I used Walgreens my entire life until they wanted to charge me $2,500+ for a medication with my good insurance. I went to Walmart pharmacy, which I had never used in my life, and it was $22.

Walking from further East up to the Capitol square- these few blocks seems so out of place and like they were dropped into the heart of Madison from somewhere else. It’s so strange,reddit,downtown

If you’re in town over the weekend, definitely check out the farmer’s market on the square on Saturday morning. You can picnic on the lawn at the capitol building, other good parks would be James Madison, Olbrich, and Brittigham. Search the sub for some good food recs. 

There’s a cool exhibit at the MMoCA right now of real vibrant and interesting sculptures; admission is free. 

You can rent a b-cycle and check out plenty of bike paths. The Lake Monona Loop is always nice.

* Williamson St. (lots of good restaurants--I like Ahan and Pig in a Fur Coat, also good thrift stores--St. Vincent's if you're a digger or Stillgoods for more curated but pricier stuff)

* If you head further down Williamson St, it'll turn into Atwood Ave. (Forward Coffee, A Room of One's Own books, lots of restaurants)

* King St. and the Capitol Square (King St. has lots of restaurants, the square has the Saturday morning farmer's market and you can see the city from the capitol observation deck, and just off the square has Bradbury's for coffee and crepes). You can also stroll down State Street from there, which is the college shopping and bar district.

I say sorry, I don’t carry cash. Start to walk away. 

Then he gets hostile. Goes, “really, you can’t even go to an ATM and get 8 bucks out for me? Everyone else helped?” Like what??? Why is this guy now piece-mealing an Uber fare?

"For food I'd probably do Vintage in Prairie du Sac. It's a short drive if you exit the park on Ski High Road and take a left on 12. It's not particularly local but I enjoy their food, and they have good craft beers as well.

When it comes to Devil's Lake, it's always packed on the weekends. I'd straight up avoid the beach unless I see it is particularly empty from the bluffs.

East bluff has probably the best views of the park, and if it's your first time I'd do that.

Park at the CCC lot at the south east corner of the park and hike up the CCC trail. This segment of the trail is the most grueling in my opinion so you get it out of the way when you're fresh. Continue along the trail and be sure to pop down and see Devil's Doorway, one of the main natural features of the park. If you're feeling adventurous and want to climb up it, just know that getting down is far more heady than getting up it, and people have died falling there in the past. 

Next up make your way along the trail to Balanced Rock, another one of the main features of the park.

From here you have a decision to make. Head down the path from Balanced Rock and make your way back to the South Shore and then hike the lower trail through the woods back to the CCC lot or head back up to the East Bluff trail and continue along the rest of the bluff. The rest of the East Bluff trail has some decent views and a few neat geological features along the way. It will end in a mostly mellow down hill hike through the woods and deposit you on the North Shore. From here you can either hike the railroad tracks along the lake back to the South Shore or head to the west side of the lake and hike the paved and more scenic Tumbled Rocks Trail along the west side of the lake to the boat landing then follow the road back to the South Shore.

Depending on the shape you're in, it can be a lot of hiking to do both bluffs, but if you're up to I'd at least do Tumbled rocks after the East bluff or even hike the top of the West bluff as well. The west bluff is a lower grade incline on the up from the north than it is from the south. You'd also get the opportunity to see Cleopatra's Needle this way if you have a keen eye.",reddit,west side

There are places on the west side with violent crime too. There absolutely are neighborhoods that are better than others but there is little random crime that isn't a crime of opportunity (unlocked cars, porch pirates, etc). In all of Madison violent crime is targeted. Though of course there are a few incidents of gun crimes and wreckless behavior in cars that it maybe just a matter of time until the next tragedy.

"Bartending wages in Madison  Hi all, 

Hoping to gain some insight into wages for bartenders in Madison. My best friend has worked in the service industry for many years. She started out as a server and moved into bartending &amp; was a bar manager at her last job. She’s an exceptional human &amp; employee with an impeccable resume, stellar references, incredibly personality/charisma and experience in some impressive spots, both in Madison &amp; other states. 

Anyway, she stated a new bartending job fairly recently at an upscale place in the general downtown area (I don’t want to get more specific). She loves her job except the pay is abysmal. I think something seems off. 

She’s really discouraged so I thought I’d see if any bartenders or friends/family members or bartenders in Madison would be up for weighing in on this discussion. 

How much do you average a shift (weekday, weekend, brunch)? Do you get tipped out by the servers (if so, is it in cash or does it just get added to your check)? What type place do you work at (dive bar, sports bar, fine dining, upscale fine dining, busy neighborhood spot?). Not asking for specifics on the establishment but just hoping for a general sense of how our hardworking bartenders of Madison are being paid! 

Any additional info, questions or comments are greatly appreciated! Just looking to help a friend and support the hardworking service industry badasses in town!",reddit,downtown

First time I’ve seen 5G is when I went to Milwaukee for summer fest which is crazy to me since it was such a crowded area! I have an unlimited plan so I don’t know if that could have something to do with it. Wondering if people have had the same experience recently. Thanks!",reddit,downtown
"Happy Easter and thanks for your patience. It’s true that Grothman has won every race since 2014 and even further back for previous elected offices (31 years in politics!!). But I’m not here to run the same traditional campaigns that previous Democrats have run. I would know, I worked on Mark Harris’s campaign, and volunteered on Dan Kohl and Jess King’s campaigns against Grothman. I’ve seen what works well and where we missed opportunities to win key voters.  
  
Here’s the truth: I won’t win with Dem votes alone. I need to win Independents and flip some Republican voters as well. That doesn’t mean I will compromise my values or beliefs but it means I will have to meet and treat all voters like human beings and authentically listen to their concerns. Coming from non-partisan office I know how to do that and have done that. I’ve had many people on different parts of the ideological spectrum vote for me in past elections because despite disagreeing on some issues, they know that I mean well and honestly care about improving people’s lives. (My partner's 73 year old traditional Republican grandfather told me he’s voting for me because he’s “just tired of what’s going on and wants to get rid of these people.”)  
  
I, like so many are tired of seeing career politicians like Grothman, break campaign promises (limit of 5 terms in Congress), purchasing stocks in Congress, having blind loyalty to party (In 2015, he was ranked the most partisan member of Congress and in 2020 was ranked the number one Trump loyalist- voting with Trump 94% of the time). That’s why I’ve made my pledges to not buy stocks while in office, say no to corporate PAC money, and host a town hall every month. This isn’t about me, it’s about giving our district a real voice, whether you’re a factory worker in Sheboygan, a farmer in Dodge County, or a student in Oshkosh. I think this will resonate with voters of all ideologies who are fed up with politics as usual.  
  
What gives me hope is what’s been happening in Wisconsin lately. Susan Crawford’s win despite Musk throwing millions against her. Over 2.3 million people voting, which was huge for a spring election, almost 70% of last year’s presidential turnout. Democrats showed up big time, and will again for the Spring 2026 election and again in Fall for the statewide elections. There’s a lot at stake in 2026!  
  
Without giving too much away to the opposition, we know where we have to pick up votes: urban Democrats, working-class voters, suburban women, rural discontents like farmers, and GOP defectors/moderates who supported Evers but not Grothman, Trump/Crawford, and those uneasy with the current admin.  
  
Couple last things. Leaning huge into social media and unconventional marketing to bring attention to this race (which hasn’t been done in previous elections because of older generation of candidates), excitement for a young progressive candidate, and just being more present (lots of public events TBA). We will need a lot of resources so please consider donating if that's financially possible for you! Thanks!",reddit,general madison

"I can’t speak for Appleton, but,

When I first moved to Madison around 2001 there were very few Asian grocery stores.  The ones I remember from that time were one medium sized Asian grocery downtown near Meriter Hospital and a small Hmong grocery on Fish Hatchery Road which has a great selection of jasmine rice.  Both still exist, and I still get my rice at the Hmong grocery because it is the only store that sells my favorite brand.  

There were probably a few others and I remember there being an Indian market either already existing or opening up soon after. 

These days there are quite a few decent sized Asian markets.  On the NE side of town there is a fairly large market connected to a food court which is almost all Asian foods.  Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Hmong, etc.  

State Street used to be mostly small local stores.  Many of them shut down in 2020 and were replaced by Asian restaurants and a small Asian grocery catering mostly to foreign students from Asia.  (Others were replaced by the 420 variety of shops but that is a different story).  

And, there are cultural groups specific to various Asian cultures.   Hmong, Tibetan, Nepalese, etc.  

I know little of Appleton. What I do know is Madison has a large number of Asians due partly to a few refugee groups such as Hmong and Tibetan, but also due to having a large research university in town.",reddit,downtown
"I grew up in south central PA, moved to SC for ten years, and then moved to WI for the last 17 years.  You are welcome to send me a DM with any specific questions.  But I will put some of the basics here:  

--The heat and humidity in SC are no joke.  From March to October, you sweat just walking to the mailbox.  It gets just as hot and humid in WI as it does in SC, but it only last two weeks or so at the most.  I prefer four seasons, especially a real fall and a real winter.  So WI wins in that category for me.  

--Both states have wonderful food cultures.  They are just very different.  When my wife and I talk about SC, the first thing we always mention missing the most is the fresh seafood.  Sitting in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant on a coastal island and pointing to the boat right next to the restaurant saying, ""I want what's coming off that boat right now,"" is second to none.  

--Taxes are much lower in SC.  When we moved there in 1998, vehicle insurance in SC was triple what it was in PA.  SC has the highest number of uninsured drivers and the highest number of attorneys per capita in the country.  

--Fall and winter in WI are distinct seasons.  Very postcard-ish.  Fall in SC is just an extension of summer.  Winter is brown and damp with temps in the 40s.  Not cold enough to have snow, not warm or dry enough to do much outside.  I much prefer the cold and snow for the variety of activities.  

--The other thing we miss a lot is the beach.  We lived two hours from the beach and two hours from the mountains.  Both were nice day trips.  In WI, the word ""beach"" has a much different meaning.  It's a lakeside or riverside strip of sand.  No waves, no unique creatures, no beach culture.  And the closest mountains to us are about 8 hours away.  

--If you're into history, SC far exceeds WI.  

--The political climates are very different.  

--The people of SC are super friendly.  ""Southern hospitality"" is the real deal.  The people of WI are great as well, but it's harder to get ""in.""  If you live in a rural part of SC, it will take a long time to feel like you're fully welcomed.  (They'll have you over for sweet tea and will be as nice as can be.  But you won't get into any deep friendships for a long time.)  WI relationships are more genuine but you won't have the initial sweetness.  You have to earn it.  Just as an illustration, we've lived in the same house for almost 17 years.  We still have neighbors two-doors down that we've never officially met even though we've hosted multiple street parties.  That would never happen in the south.  You'll know all your neighbors--at least on the surface--immediately.  

I could go on and on.  I can't speak to living in a WI city larger than 50,000.  And I can't speak to living in a SC city larger than 200,000.  But feel free to ask anything you'd like to know.

Edit: Would someone care to explain the downvote? I simply shared my personal experiences.",reddit,general madison
"This is not an issue caused by employees or usually even the business. Most tap to pay hospitality establishments use a system called Toast. Toast automatically tags that question onto the end of every sale to complete the function. Unless you’re at a restaurant, the owners of the establishment (ie, at an event) don’t know that people are being asked to tip and are not allocating tips accordingly. I suspect many managers pocket them.

THAT SAID, this doesn’t apply to restaurants/coffee shops; they know where the money goes and you are directly paying the employees- who depend on tips and do not set the price of goods or dictate inflation :)",reddit,general madison
"Great point. The solution to the exponential rise in fast food restaurants isn't to give them more money, it's to go to them way less or not at all.

"I’m going to have some brutal honesty about this city that others may not be willing to disclose. It’s not to talk you out of anything it’s simply so you have all the possible information. 

This is coming from someone who is originally from the state line and have lived in Chicago, Salt Lake, and a very small town near Port Townsend. 

The job market here is kind of bleak unless you work in healthcare or law. If you’re looking at working for Epic know that their turnover rate is high. We have the second lowest vacancy rate in the country. Only being beaten by NYC. Meaning NYC is the only place with a more competitive housing market than we do. Rents are high and going higher. Seattle is still more expensive but jobs pay more there. If you don’t drink, and I mean to the point of having a problem- it’ll be a little hard to make friends here. Wisconsin is the drunkest state in the union and this college town is no exception. You are not prepared for the heat and cold you will feel here. If extreme temperature changes doesn’t bother you then hell yeah! Making friends here is difficult, or can be. I don’t know what your politics are- I’m assuming at least left leaning. We need more true progressives here but it’s a fight. There’s a lot of uneducated racists here. We get yt supremacists marching here. We also have protests here as a good chunk cares about social issues. Others will stay at home and blindly listen to the news though and not care to have their minds changed. Our past decade or so we’ve had high stakes elections as we are a swing state and both parties try to take as much as possible. We need good people coming here dedicated to making it what it tries to be. But that’s going to come with a lot of work. There’s plenty of orgs and whatnot here that are trying their hardest and doing excellent work. This is not a place for someone who is burnt out from it or wants to ignore things though. Things will be much more difficult for you if you are Black or brown. Things will be more difficult if you’re queer. There’s community here for both but lots of people whom are both have been fleeing this city to a safer one like Minneapolis or Chicago. Public transit is also not recommended to rely on. There’s buses, sure. It is still not set up in a way that’s cohesive and accessible for the whole city. I know it’s made a bunch of lists of “happiest cities to live in” and I couldn’t disagree more. There’s some great stuff here don’t get me wrong! I don’t feel like I need to go over that because everyone else in the comment section already has. I want to point out the ugly stuff that people won’t open up about. Lastly, if you do move here, please do not move here in August. Finding an apartment around then is not going to be fun and you will want to slam your head into a wall with the stress 😅😅 (college move in) 

I’m sorry it’s so long and yes I’m really going in on the city here- I’ve got my own beef with this place and I recognize that. I just want you to have as much information as possible before making that 30/40 hour drive or whatever it is (did it myself about six years ago)",reddit,general madison
"Also worked there. They don't throw away the ""vast majority"" of donations but they do discard a lot of stuff that can't be sold, often due to health or legal reasons because a lot of people donate their literal trash instead of anything useful that can actually be used or resold. Things like soiled clothing, broken goods and electronics, medical supplies, mattresses, old CRT monitors, etc. There are people whose entire job is to sort through everything that is donated.

And no, they don't give things away. They never have. Their purpose is not to provide free or cheap goods. They sell items in their thrift stores to raise money for services that assist people with disabilities and provide job services to people with life challenges.

If you had actually worked there, you'd know that.

It wasn't the best place to work for a number of reasons, but they are a legit nonprofit.

I can't tell you how many times I've gotten caught through 2-3 light changes because the person at the front of the line is waiting for there to be an opportunity to turn left against a flashing yellow and the oncoming traffic just does not stop.  If people don't creep out to claim it, they're simply *never* going to be able to take that turn.  Since I doubt the city would be *that* to stupid to drop an unprotected left onto a section of roadway where there would never be an opportunity to take a left *at all*, I would assume that they expect people to claim the intersection and at least get 1 or 2 people through on the yellow versus none at all.


But...maybe they are that stupid, I don't know, I'm not a traffic engineer.  What I *do* know is, this kind of stuff is a perfect example of how ""Midwest Nice While Driving"" isn't always the best course of action.  Though not as egregious as some of the other stuff I see regularly, like coming to a dead stop in a 45 4-lane road to wave a pedestrian across thats nowhere near a crosswalk and expecting everyone in the adjacent lanes to read your mind, somebody that's afraid to pull up a car length and take a left on a yellow, or thinks it's rude for some reason, could more or less eliminate the ability for anyone to take that perfectly legal left on a yellow.",reddit,general madison

🧠 Take time to orient before coming in. Everyone has a different approach towards mindfulness, but level heads will create our power as a crowd.

❤️‍🩹 **Prepare to be patient with other people.** We all have different causes, different things in our “backpack” that bring us onto this journey. Listen, feel, share - and let’s be a safe space for each other. Remember to DEFUSE.

"They are the lowest paying pharmacy around, and that means only people with no experience work there.   Anyone who has experience will find another place and those that do work at Walgreens will leave as soon as something better opens up and they get their experience.   

With this, since Walgreens doesn’t care about its employees, they don’t care about their jobs (obviously I’m exaggerating and being hyperbolic), they care less about the customer, and hence the Walgreens we see today.

I stopped going there completely years ago when they were out of stock on my medication but waited until I went to pick it up to tell me.   They wouldn’t call around for me and when I called other Walgreens, they’d say they can’t tell me if they gave it in stock or not until my doctor calls it in, so he’d call and then they’d tell me no they don’t have it…. Rinse and repeat a few times and I swore I was done with them, and haven’t looked back.",reddit,general madison

That may vary by country or currency though.

With UWCU you can also get a basic credit card tied to your account. I don't recommend going through BOA. There aren't any in Wisconsin and I've had a credit card with then since I was in high school. On top of the monthly interest they're charging 1% of the balance.

"So I grew up about 45 minutes from Madison, but lived in Seattle for 11 years before moving back to Wisconsin in 2015 - so I lived in Seattle through a lot of the worst of the Amazon boom, and I go back frequently to visit.  I love the PNW, but Seattle is too dang corporate now.  I do see a lot of the same trends happening here (tech-bro-ification via Epic and the associated housing bullshit that comes with it) but hopefully we manage to change things a little bit (it's also nowhere near as bad yet).  

Anyway, skeeters will really only be bad in like, parks, camping, walking through wetland trails, that sort of thing. Though reports will differ, because mosquitos like some people more than others.  So, you might be ignored while the person next to you is eaten alive.  It's BANANAS.  The summer green is WAY more intense but winter is even more grey with fewer evergreens, and it just plain lasts longer.  Despite more sun, it's cold so if you are outside you're mostly covered, so that really does perpetuate the SADS for a lot of folks.  But despite the growing season being shorter, summer is fucking spectacular (I hate being hot and sweaty, but grilling, swimming, cold beer, and fantastic produce really help with that), and the hotter (on average) weather means things like tomatoes do WAY better here than Seattle.  Thunderstorms are a true thing of beauty also not often seen in the Seattle area!  

A lot has been covered, but... while Madison is very liberal as a college/tech town, much of the outside area is yeah, purple at best, and VERY church-ey.  Like you will see abortion and 1-800-JESUS-SAVES billboards on the side of the road... many times next to a sex toy/porno store.  In more rural areas, being at least vaguely christian will be just like, generally assumed, and I didn't realize how pervasive it was until I left it.  It's a pretty big cultural change, but in the actual Madison area (and some other liberal enclaves in the state - some of them being surprising, like Ashland way up on lake superior) it's going to be much more similar to Seattle. 

Overall, while I would move back to western Washington, I don't think I could actually live in Seattle... like I would have to be out of commuting range.  It's just too damn busy!  Madison is big enough to have the stuff I need (like indie queer bookstores!), but also small enough that I keep running into people who are connected to people I know.... and I'm not an outgoing, involved person in the community.  I missed the seasons, and the Weather.  And, like, the food scene here is amazing, and still affordable.  Every time my bestie visits they're like ""IT SO GOOD, BUT SO CHEAP, WTF.""  There's also still like, an actual community feel here.  There's lots of transplants, but lots of old timers too, and things like neighborhood street festivals and community garage sale days and shit like that.  Sometimes people walking by stop to chat while we're sitting on our porch, because they knew the last folks who were here for almost 40 years, etc.",reddit,general madison

"I come from a small town in KY. There’s a prudishness about drinking and people tend to hide their drinking. Here in Fort Atkinson we have a smorgasbord of venues. 
There’s Paddy’s Irish Pub for good drinks with dinner.
Bienfang’s for cheap beer and old fashioneds(tight knit cops/firefighters/municipal workers)
Cafe Carpe for the granola crowd who enjoy drinks with talented musicians and like minded yuppies. 
1062 is a hole in the wall where everyone knows your name and they probably have some crockpots with food to share.
Fat Boyz is Biker themed with good fried food.
Proof Speakeasy has an upscale vibe and a good date night spot (splurge).
Brock’s Riverwalk Tavern turns into a dance spot late in the evening.
Paddyshavk has a family atmosphere with games for kids and golf simulators.
My personal favorite for cheap drinks and the best view of the river for summer sunsets is the American Legion.

Having lived here for 14 years, I can’t go into any of these places without seeing at least one person I know. 

There’s probably a dozen more bars, but the ones I listed are densely located. 

Another fun aspect to the bar culture is the 50/50 raffles, Meat Raffles, Pull Tabs, and there are theme nights featuring games and trivia. 

Finally, I think a lot of the bar culture is in part due to the cold climate. People want to gather, but it’s so darned cold 2/3rds of the year, so we drink together.",reddit,general madison

"Be careful to submit your loan/grant/scholarship well in advance of every semester if you plan on relying on that money. There is some law (at least for loans) that the loan companies are required to wait about 2 weeks from when the loan is finalized to when they can send out the loan, plus any extra time the school needs to confirm the money. So if your loan is finalized on August 26th because you didn't start the loan process until August 16th, your loan won't reach the school until September 4th, and you wont get the money until September 6th. I am speaking from experience here, but luckily I also have a job to support myself with. Also there is an earliest date they can send it out, which I think is around a week before school. I usually got my refund around August 31st.

Also the amount of money I said earlier was wrong, it was $9400 this year. I was thinking of last year.

Just a fair warning, don't play around with this money, especially if you don't have a job. It is against state law for your loan provider (if you have one) to give you any more money through your loan then what the college sets. That is why UW-Madison sets the living cost so high: it lets you get the amount of money they think you need to live for the semester and nothing more. If you run out of money: it's might get tough for you.

Also if you do have a loan provider, this IS money you HAVE to pay back eventually. If you can instead be one of the lucky people who gets a $30/hour+ job and live off of that instead of the e-refund and just pay back the e-refund they give you instantly, do that instead. You can not get rid of student loans easily, and they get even more expensive as time goes on. I recommend going for scholarships as best you can to avoid any loan provider hassle. If you only have loans through the US government instead of private lenders, or pay for school entirely through scholarship/grants, you can mostly ignore this advice (you should still get a high paying job if you can though).",reddit,general madison

Both are nice size cities that aren't huge or over crowded, plenty of the things you're looking for and finding a house with an acre or so within your budget should be doable, although likely more expensive than Eau Claire.

"I was! Although I prefer the term mormon, as that is how most people know it (including those of us in the church during their ""I am a mormon campaign""). They do wish to be called LDS now, some would say so fewer people will associate them with their controversial past.

I can only speak to my own lived experience and those in my life who have shared their stories with me, but I would highly highly highly recommend checking out the r/exmormon subreddit for more experiences both inside and outside of Utah. 

Isolating members and penalizing them for leaving

We were taught that while we should be friendly to nonmembers (with the goal of conversion), it was ill advised to become close friends with them and recommended to try to associate only with other righteous members of the church whenever possible. They did not want you to closely associate with anyone who leaves the church, unless it's in an effort to convert. When I left the church, many of my friends and extended family stopped talking with me. When I go back to visit my parents they will ""forget they also happened to invite the missionaries that day"" who will try to monopolize my time that I wanted to spend with my younger siblings. I will get nonstop emails and texts from my dad trying to get me back into the fold. They'll be nice but distant to make you want to come back, but once you go back there is nothing but shame and guilt for not following their strict (and often irrational) rules.

Seeking inappropriate loyalty to their leaders

If you do not ""sustain"" your church leaders, you cannot receive the blessings of the temple. Even when what you think they are doing is wrong. Leaders of the church are constantly in the news for rape and other inappropriate behavior towards minors in closed door bishops interviews, and the church pays for their defense and refuses to put into place any policy that will require another adult in the room during these interviews (which, if you haven't been to one, can be an interrogation depending on what bishop you happen to get).

Dishonoring the family unit

We are taught to put the religion above all else, and while the church claims families are foundational to their beliefs, they must make difficult decisions when their family goes against their beliefs. Children of gay couples cannot be baptized unless they disavow their parents' lifestyle. Nonmembers cannot watch their mormon family members get married, they must wait outside and greet them when it's over. Trans family members must have a guardian clear out the church bathrooms and wait inside the bathroom for them. Gay members cannot get married.

Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability.

Honestly I could go on for days about this one but its getting a bit long. A good example is the sexual abuse perpetuated by church leaders and covered up by the church. If you get high enough in their ranks (think stake president or higher), there is a secret ritual called the second annointing. After you receive this ritual, you are incapable of doing any wrong in the eyes of the church, including murder.

No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.

If you asked any controversial questions or made any critical statements against the church, you would be scolded or further disciplined, even excommunicated. A recent example of this you can Google is Nemo The Mormon (who advocates for accountability in the church for sexual abuse committed by leadership), or John Delin (the founder of Mormon Stories). They do not teach you the church's full history when you are in the church. I never learned about the wives of Joseph Smith (minors as young as 14, sisters, and even mother-daughter pairs 🤢). They do not teach you about how they burned a printing press in Nauvoo, IL for speaking critically of the church. They do not teach you about the Mountain Meadows Massacre. I would recommend checking out CESLetter.Org to learn more about what we weren't taught as mormons. We were also taught to only seek truth from pro-mormon sources, and any other sources were anti-mormin lies.

No meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget, expenses such as an independently audited financial statements.

The church does not disclose how it uses tithing dollars. It was recently fined by the feds for hiding a $32 billion investment fund behind shell companies.

Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies, and persecutions.

LDS is short for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Emphasis on Latter-Day, they believe we are in the last days. Many have been told in patriarchal blessings that they will be alive when the second coming of christ happens. Mormons are advised to keep at least 2 months of food storage to be prepared for the apocalypse. This is why doomsday preppers like Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell feel encouraged to go to the extremes they did.

There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil.

Anyone who leaves the true church, and especially those who speak against it go to a place called outer darkness to live in misery with the other wicked spirits that followed Lucifer in the premortal existence. This is where I will be going ✌️

Followers feel they can never be ""good enough"".

Everything is a sin in the mormon church, even having the wrong thoughts. If you listen to the Mormon Stories Podcast, a common theme from true believing followers is what is known as scrupulocity (sp?), a form of religious OCD where they have to be absolutely perfect. 

The group/leader is always right.

Their core belief is that the prophet of the church speaks directly for God and is not to be questioned and must be sustained by members to participate in certain church activities. Questioning a prophet can even lead to excommunication. In hindsight when prophets say something that a future prophet contradicts, well then they were just ""acting as a man"" in those moments (bur we only say that after they're dead and no longer in power).

The group/leader is the exclusive means of knowing ""truth"" or receiving validation, no other process of discovery is really acceptable or credible.

This is the same as the last point, but I'll add that they believe that only the (male) prophet can receive direct revelation from God surrounding the church, a (male) area authority is the only one who can receive revelation from God for their area unless the prophet says otherwise, a (male) bishop is the only one who can receive revelation for their ward unless the prophet or area authority says otherwise, and a father is the only one who can receive direct revelation for his family unless the prophet, area authority, or bishop say otherwise. If a mother were to receive direct revelation from God for her family, it would not be credible.

That seems to mean after each game someone has to leave and go find another group to play with somehow. Since we always bring 4-8 of us, we’re really just looking for a court to ourselves. I tried looking up the court rules somewhere, but can’t find any rules or general pickleball etiquette on whether we can just keep playing in a court or not. City of Madison’s site just says it’s first come first serve except for league reservations. Is there anywhere that formally states when or what the rules are for how long someone can play for or if we have to rotate in other people outside our group? I’ve seen some people answer with online pickleball scheduling sites, but those don’t seem to be reservations, more just resources to find other players if you need someone to play with.

"I Experienced Racial Discrimination at UW-Madison, and the School Is Doing Nothing Hello everyone,

I'm a Asian international student at UW–Madison, and I want to share an incident that has left me extremely frustrated and stressed.

On October 22nd at around 6:10 PM, I was waiting for a friend on state street when two men approached me. They started making monkey noises at me and took videos, even holding the camera close to my face without my consent. This went on for about fifteen seconds. At first, I didn't understand what was happening .. I just stared at them. By the time I realized that this was racial discrimination, they had already walked away.

Fortunately, two bystanders witnessed the whole incident. They caught up to them and took clear photos of their faces, and they are willing to be witnesses. Using these photos, I asked around and managed to identify one of them—he is an undergraduate student here.

I called UWPD to report the incident, but they only said they would investigate it. I also reached out to the Office of Student Assistance and Support. However, they told me that all they could do was invite the student to a VOLUNTARY conversation.

I can't even believe this is real. It's like something I'd never dream of happening .. like being robbed in the library. I feel extremely helpless. There are witnesses, there are photos, I even identified one of the individuals, everything seems to be perfectly aligned to take action, yet the university is nott taking this seriously.

Is this what it means to be an Asian student here? To stand on the street and be subjected to ridicule, to be treated like a monkey, to have a camera shoved in my face without my consent, and for the school to think they don't need to do anything???

I'm sharing this here because I don't know what else to do.. Has anyone else experienced something similar? What steps can I take to ensure the university addresses this issue?

"One of the no-good, horrible &amp; sh.tty arguments we keep hearing is that it would be devastating to the economy because the entire healthcare insurance industry hires/employs a ton of people but even that is complete BS because it could easily be phased out over time, many people could switch over to working for the Universal Healthcare Administration &amp;/or you could just create a Public/Private Hybrid insurance system like France, Germany, Switzerland the UK &amp; a bunch of other countries.


I'm a Swiss-French Expat in the US.
My only experiences with Health insurance before moving to the US were dealing with the French Systems.
France has a Hybrid insurance system. Public insurance keeps you alive &amp; healthy.
Private insurance is supplemental &amp; gets you access to more/better services.

Not that the Public option is bad, but you get whatever service is considered to be the most affordable/cheapest.
Need glasses? You get the least expensive frames available. Need something done that might be considered to be cosmetic? Not happening unless it's considered to be something that might affect your ability to work or get a job.
Private Clinics charge more than Public hospitals &amp; Public insurance will only cover the costs that they would cover at a Public Hospital.
Private Clinics tend to treat you faster &amp; private insurance usually cover the difference, so if you have it, it's worth it. Public Hospital service could take several hours, depending on the urgency of the issue. Private Clinics will treat you within 30 minutes to an hour.


If you have a job, you'll most likely be provided with private/supplemental insurance &amp; get all the fancy higher quality services.


French Public Healthcare Services are still amazing, but that sweet private insurance really kicks it up a notch.


Employers want private supplemental insurance because it usually means that their employees won't be out of work nearly as long &amp; get back to work faster if it's just simple appointments or injuries.
Win-Win.


If you're unemployed, you can afford to wait longer to get treated if it's not an urgent issue. As far as I'm aware, Accommodations are made for people who genuinely can't work/are severely disabled.
It's not perfect &amp; I know that the system has its issues, but it's undeniably better than what we currently have in the US.


Last time we visited France, My SO got sick &amp; needed to see the doctor.
23 Euros out of pocket for that visit &amp; 10-ish Euros for the meds at the pharmacy. We had travel insurance but it wasn't even worth the time &amp; effort to make a claim.

The pharmacist told me it was going to be expensive because they were out of the Generic. I asked her how bad &amp; laughed when she told me. She looked at me weird &amp; I explained to her why I laughed. She was horrified.
I looked up the price of those meds in the US. $80 per pill for a Generic. We paid less than 10 Euros for a pack of 10 of the Brand-Name stuff.


Healthcare in France is somewhat of a Hot Topic because it's often argued that it's going broke &amp; needs reforms, but there has to be some kind of middle-ground.",reddit,general madison

"The biggest factor in this is roommates.

If you **need** a newer one bedroom apartment with nice amenities, underground parking, etc etc then you need at least 60k. A lot of people pretend their preferences are their needs and it’s annoying tbh.

$60k in Madison sharing a 3 bedroom house you could get as low as like, $800/mo and that’s living very comfortably. A 1br apartment, you’re going to start being stretched because those are ~1,300 starting rate.

Anywhere else in the state with roommates you could be looking at only $400/mo with roommates.

Now if you’ve got kids and thus can’t have roommates, you’ve either got to make more money or move somewhere cheaper because a two bed in Madison is running ~$2,000 or more and a 3 bedroom anywhere north of $2,500. At which point you need to be making almost $100k to get to the 30% of income on housing threshold.",reddit,general madison

"Very few people in their late teens ever consider opportunity cost; that is, what am I losing by making a particular decision. But it’s a critical parameter to consider when making the “what college should I go to?” decision. You’re getting a lot of “Madison better, go there,” responses, but the decision isn’t nearly so clear. 

In terms of prestige: it doesn’t matter. School districts need teachers, and they’ll gladly accept anyone with drive, passion, and the appropriate certification. You will never find yourself in a position where a principal or superintendent says, “well, I have only one slot to fill, and so I’m going to take the Madison grad over the Whitewater one.” It just won’t happen. Nor will it increase the likelihood that you’ll get paid more. So don’t worry about the brand name. 

In terms of academic quality: it matters less than you think. There is a massive oversupply of PhDs in every field and high quality professors are everywhere now. The professors at a regional school like Whitewater are there because they *want* to be there, not because they couldn’t hack it in the Big Leagues and got demoted. They opted for a career where they would have more direct interactions with students instead of a place where students are often considered a distraction. 

In terms of cost: hoo boy, this is where the distinction is huge. You’re going to be a teacher, which you’re obviously not doing for the glamour or salary. How much more will four years at Madison cost? Not just tuition dollars, but housing, food, wear and tear on your car, everything? All that will run into at least $20k over four years. Elsewhere you say you’re from Janesville. Would you live at home if you went to Whitewater? If so, you could more than double your savings by going to UWW. 

Intangibles: obviously, if you want to watch big time football or party on State Street, there’s an unambiguous winner. And that’s an important part of the college experience. But is that worth the opportunity cost of starting out with $20,000+ less than you would have if you went to Whitewater instead? That’s basically half the salary of a first year teacher.

"Music Festival at UW-Madison Hi all,

I am currently a senior strategic communications major at UW-Madison. After researching for a project in my journalism class about the local music scene in Madison during my sophomore year, I came across details about the Revelry Music and Arts Festival. I was instantly hooked. I spent hours looking for more information about this event and discovered a few articles and social media pages, subsequently realizing that the festival had been officially canceled and discontinued back in 2014. Long story short, my friend and I jokingly proposed that we should try to revive the idea of a festival right in the heart of Madison. 

  
After scheduling meetings with 4-5 members of the previous festival and gathering helpful information on why it was/wasn't successful, we met with the school and the Wisconsin Union Directorate (WUD), but had no luck. The committee didn't believe in our idea and immediately shut it down, even after asking for a pitch deck, marketing plan, and confirmed sponsorships across campus (we had already established over 15 State Street sponsorships at this point).  

Honestly, I don't know why I am sharing this, but I hope to receive some feedback on the idea and/or hear from underclassmen who could be interested in reviving it, as we only have one semester left! It is something truly missing at UW-Madison.

"I split time between SW WI (west of Madison) and IL (Chicago). In terms of taxes, this will depend greatly on which county in IL you’re comparing to (property taxes go to the county).

I like WI better as a place to live. Better natural surroundings, on the whole (at least in my area) people seem to look out for each other a bit more than in most places in IL. There’s not a lot of diversity in WI (I’m not white so I notice), but that’s true for the majority of IL too.

Politics in WI have been dominated so greatly by the far right in the recent past that the services you get for your tax money (other than amazing parks) are pretty minimal. WI ranks next to last in the nation in relation to public arts funding, has very little support for kids/people with special needs, and so forth. They outlawed abortion until the public said fuck that shit and elected a left-leaning judge to the Supreme Court to overturn it. These things may not matter or apply to you, but they should give you some sense on the overall values of the state (at least as determined by political bodies). But I have to say my rare dealings with government here (DNR and DMV mostly) have been some of the most pleasant I’ve had in my 50 years on this space rock.

If you’re left—leaning, look at the Madison surrounding areas; they are some of the most progressive areas in the Midwest if not the country. It’s not too far from the IL border either (maybe an hour depending on where you’re going—and IMO it’s better to have some separation from family than free babysitting or whatever). The landscape in the Driftless Area is incredible and the lack of megahuge farms creates local economies that are resilient and wonderful. Some areas in and outside Milwaukee have the same, though outside Milwaukee are some of the most right-leaning places in the state.

If you’re right-leaning or center there is plenty of WI for you. Not that politics is the end all be all but these days politics seem to define communities of people, at least a lot more so than they did when I was growing up. If you like the packers, Green Bay and areas on the Lake Michigan coast can be really nice.",reddit,general madison
"Registering salvage vehicle questions We moved to this beautiful state recently and we are having a terrible time getting our vehicle registered. Based on what the inspector is telling us we have a $15k paperweight. I can’t imagine this is accurate, but maybe you guys can help. We bought a vehicle, 2016 Honda Fit, in our previous state (South Dakota) that had a salvaged title, but had been repaired. From what I know, the repair was from at least 2 sellers ago. We bought it from a seller who had bought it from a dealer. We have owned several salvaged vehicles and repaired several ourselves- but this one was already fixed. I think there was some damage to the front quarter panel, but we are able to thoroughly look over the vehicle to the point we didn’t ask for details on the damage. We moved to Wisconsin and transferred the title, but they couldn’t register it without an inspection. Ok- not something that happens in SD (no inspections at all), but no problem. We received our new WI title and began trying to schedule an inspection. It took weeks and numerous phone calls to get “the right” inspector on the phone and he told us he can’t do an inspection without pictures of the damage and a parts list with serial numbers. This is literally impossible for us to provide and we explained why. He told us we were SOL basically and got really mad when we asked to speak to someone higher. He would not give us a name or number to find out what we can do if we have no access to this information. I really can’t imagine we are the first people to move to WI with a vehicle that was repaired before they owned it. I plan to reach out to someone at the state or a state legislator to find out where to turn next, but maybe you guys have some insight before business hours tomorrow!

However, I did end up walking to Sencha and was looking very cunt doing so in my cheap lil pointy sunglasses. While sauntering on through the crowd, a very slick and mischievous man reached out to fist bump me. With a confused smile reciprocated. Alas, he pulled away and slicked back his hair with an arrogant smirk. Very uncouth behaviour.

My feelings were hurt and the blow to my ego was immeasurable. I can never go back, I'm transferring elsewhere immediately.",reddit,downtown

"what would be my best option for working during the school year? option a: CNA. pros: good pay, good to gain experience in my desired field. cons: would have to commute to a hospital via bus, likely not flexible hours, would be kinda draining

option b: waitressing. pros: lots of locations/options, good pay, walkable. cons: hard work, likely not ideal hours for students

option c: chipotle. pros: free food, money back for tuition (i believe its a bit over $5000 annually), walkable, likely flexible schedule. cons: fast food, would have to work about 260 hours a semester to qualify, haven't heard great things about the location on state street

"general dorm selection advice This is somewhat late, but here is some dorming advice from someone who dormed this year! i am in southeast with many, many friends in lakeshore so I know a lot about both parts.

Tip 1 - staying in lakeshore is really not that bad. in my opinion, not really that far. You have a dining hall and a library close to you. The 80/82 run every 5 minutes so you can just bus to other parts of campus if necessary and when the weather's good the 20 minute (at best) walk isn't bad at all. I ended up walking to lakeshore more than I needed to as a lakeshore resident to see my friends and it's not bad at all. I actually think the worst dorm in terms of location is Smith, as it's isolated from the rest of campus and I've always found its location to be a bit annoying.

Tip 2 - Southeast dorms are very hit or miss. Yes, can be very fun and social, but there's usually a 50% chance of that happening. What I mean by this is if you don't click with the people living near you or get into that friend group at the start of the year then it really doesn't matter. It can be annoying because they do end up taking up a lot of the common areas of the dorm but overall not really a problem. Some parts of southeast are chill and quiet, as southeast is a mix of people who are actually social and want to be social. This can be nice, you will not enjoy your Thursday-Saturday nights sometimes if you live in a floor/area of your dorm that is loud.

Tip 3 - I'm definitely biased but in my opinion my favorite dorms are Chad and Waters. Locations are amazing, both have a dining hall (while I think Liz's Market is vastly inferior to Rheta's), are going to be close to your classes (if you're doing gen eds it's almost guaranteed you'll be up the hill anyways), generally are a good location and close to state street and all. The dorms themselves are also fine. The plus side to Chad over Waters is AC, which can be a big deal when it's hot out but really only a problem in the very start of the year when it's really warm. I think being able to control temperature is big, which Chad has. Waters has muchhhh bigger dorms. Chad is much smaller, but honestly you get used to it. I've had my own big room my whole life and moved into a double in Chad and struggled with it a bit at first but it's really not that bad after a bit. Chad also has flamingo run which is really nice. Overall, I think Chad takes first place but with those 2 being on top.

Tip 4 - If you're struggling to deal with your roommate, don't be hesitant to get a room switch. It can be annoying to move, but definitely going to be worth it for you. It's very unlikely you'll be in a tough situation in your next room assignment.

If I think of anything else I'll add it but just some basic things I guess",reddit,downtown

"Wisconsin's Big Economic Opportunity -- ADVOCATE FOR IT!!!!! I know that the recent news cycle for us is filled with the August 13 partisan primary and the upcoming November election -- all politically important events -- but I am hoping to convince you there is a third economically and politically important thing that you should be paying attention to. So important that I believe you should call your representatives and senators in the legislature to advocate for it. 

What is it that I am talking about? I am talking about the opportunity (and possibility!) that exists for us to build a strong economic hub like that of the Research Triangle in North Carolina, Austin's ""Silicon Hills"" or tech hub, and California's infamous Silicon Valley. Now that isn't to say that we have the possibility to recreate silicon valley here in Wisconsin -- or recreate any of those economic hubs that I mentioned -- but we have the opportunity to create something similar. I am not so good at writing, but I hope you can give me some time to explain this opportunity that I see for our state.

To take a few steps back, I have been recently looking at why there are certain regions that are so economically productive and how it is they were created. I focused exclusively on American economic, so (statistically speaking) I am more than likely biased in my conclusion, and I noticed that many economic hubs in our country (Silicon Valley, Austin's tech hub, and the Research Triangle) have three things going for them: A symbiotic relationship of a sprit of entrepreneurship, strong STEM research universities, and industry collaboration -- with government incentives/aid throughout these three forces. They achieved this symbiotic relationship differently and started with varying strengths in those three aspects, but the thing I noticed is that fundamentally those are the three forces -- and again there may be something I am missing because my research is limited to these three examples --  that produce a strong and productive economic hub. The creation of these hubs has brought these areas not just jobs but high paying jobs, higher tax revenue, created new industries to replace the old ones, and more. 

Now I want to get to Wisconsin. As you may have read about recently, Wisconsin is the recipient of 49 million dollars from U.S. Economic Development Administration to build a Biotech/Personal Healthcare hub in the Madison-Milwaukee area; additionally, we have gotten $7.5 million dollars in state funding and $24 million dollars in industry commitments for creating this hub as well. You might think that this is enough, and that we are already creating a economic hub of sorts. I disagree. We need to strike more boldly and commit ourselves more. I think we can do better given our state's financial condition and social condition. In my opinion, our aim should not just be to create a biotech/personal healthcare hub languidly, but rather to create a strong STEM focused hub with the biotech/personal healthcare hub at it core. 

So what am I talking about when it comes to our financial and social condition? Well, I am talking about the financial fact that our state has had a budget surplus last year. Big enough that even with using this surplus over the next two years -- saving for a rainy day, tax cuts, etc -- we still will have some money left (projected around 4 billion I believe). But our social condition -- though I am wholeheartedly optimistic about Wisconsin's future -- doesn't look so well.   From UW System Facts and Trends, Wisconsin is facing a decline in the number of high school students going to college, we are projected to face a net-outward migration all the while we have an aging population with declining birth rates, state spending per student is lagging tremendously behind our neighbors (growing only 1.3% from 2011-21), funding per student in our four-year campuses is ranked 43rd nationally, campuses have many buildings that haven’t had their things related to their buildings (electrical, HVAC, plumbing, etc) replaced or repaired, and more. Meaning that we are not investing into our colleges as much as other states are, nor are we trying our best to maintain a workforce that is highly learned and talented for all the new developments in industries that are happening due to falling enrollments, outward migration, declining birth rates, and the rest mentioned above. But most importantly of all, all of this will more than likely negatively impact Wisconsin's economy and our state's future. 

Now comes my belief. In my eyes, I see that we have great universities, are in a strong financial position, have gotten a start from the federal government to build our economic hub, and have all our strengths, but we are not committed to it. We should be, at the very least, matching the federal government's 49 million dollars of funding for the economic hub because we have a surplus that allows us to do so. We should match that 49 million dollars (or more) to go towards helping our universities build up their STEM research/rigor, incentivizing the entrepreneurship spirit by bridging STEM with business in our colleges, and fund the biotech/personal healthcare hub idea. What I am getting at is that we should strike boldly – not languidly like we are right now. 

Why? When you think about it, biotechnology/personal healthcare doesn't just happen in a vacuum of the biological sciences – you need physicists, engineers of all types, mathematicians, and computer scientists to create new healthcare devices or medicines. But more than that, for companies to be located in Wisconsin to bring not only jobs but well paying jobs, Wisconsin must develop our human capital by our STEM programs. Having an abundance of Wisconsinites that are knowledgeable in STEM fields – or developing our state’s human capital – is crucial for luring industries to move here and for them to bring not just jobs but high paying jobs that are associated with the STEM fields. It also means that Wisconsin entrepreneurs don’t have to seek their ideas in other places where there is lesser scarcity of STEM graduates. Some commitment like the one above would be a commitment to our state’s youth that they don’t have to go out of the state to be in the best university, conduct research, or find jobs: it is right here – right at our home state. Am I wrong in saying that people would move or be incentivized to build a family in a state where they know an economic virtuous cycle is going on? Success attracts, so we must aim to make the future of our state successful. 

So I want you, if you have the time to do so, to call (or leave a message to) your representatives and senators to ask for a bill that would provide the funding to the ideas mentioned above. Tell them that you want to see more commitment to developing STEM research/rigor in Wisconsin, tell them you want to see our colleges foster a relationship between STEM programs and business programs/learning, and tell them that we should not be lazy in our commitment to building the Biotech/Personal Healthcare hub. Did you know that Massachusetts is also a strong Biotech/Personal Healthcare hub? So it should not be taken that we won't face competition when creating our own Biotech/Personal healthcare hub. The stronger our commitment, the stronger our chance of success.

I know post like mine are supposed to have an ending, so I will try my best: We Wisconsinites, long ago made a tryst with an ideal known as the Wisconsin idea – using our state's universities to benefit our society – but we have stepped out of the path. We must return to it. We must do so by boldly declaring – through legislative action – our commitment to our universities so that they may do the same to benefit Wisconsin. This comes, in its most basic form, by funding our universities more and planting within the minds of the youths that go there buds of business and entrepreneurship.  

TL;DR: Funding our universities' STEM departments for doing more research and being more rigorous, creating a bridge between the stem departments and the business departments in our colleges to foster entrepreneurship, and committing more to creating the planned biotech/personal healthcare hub in Wisconsin would lead to Wisconsin developing a strong STEM based economic hub that would bring lots of high paying jobs, newer industries, tax money, and generally benefit our state's economy long term. This idea of funding STEM research is bipartisan -- it passed Congress with bipartisan support like seen in the CHIPS and Science ACT, so it can most definitely pass ours! So, call your representatives and senators to pass a bill  to do so.",reddit,campus

"The Growing Tick Population Problem in WI! Hey fellow Wisconsinites! If you're an avid outdoors enthusiast, dog owner, or just generally noticed the growing problem with ticks over the last few years you've also probably wondered why there haven't been *any* sort of community action towards controlling their growing population. This is especially concerning as ticks have grown more resilient to pesticides and continue to be a vector of harmful bacteria and disease.

Using ChatGPT as a backbone for organization and further ideas, it came up with what I feel is a very strong plan of action you and your neighboors can enact to keep your pets and family safe from these pesky blood suckers. I'd like to share this plan in an effort to control the boom we've seen in ticks over the last 5-10 years.

Community Tick Control Action Plan

Objective:
Reduce local tick populations and lower the risk of tick-borne diseases through coordinated education, habitat management, and monitoring.

Phase 1: Organization and Planning

Form a Task Force:

Include members from local government, public health departments, parks and recreation, environmental groups, hunters, and concerned citizens.

Assign Roles:

Education Coordinator, Field Management Leader, Data Manager, Community Outreach Leader, etc.

Secure Funding:

Apply for local/state grants, fundraise, or partner with local businesses.

Phase 2: Public Education Campaign

Host Workshops:

Teach residents how to make their yards less tick-friendly.

Demonstrate proper tick removal and personal protection methods.

Develop Materials:

Flyers, online posts, and signage in parks and trails (""Stay on trails,"" ""Check for ticks after hiking,"" etc.).

School Programs:

Implement tick-awareness programs in schools.

Phase 3: Habitat Management

Organize Community Clean-up Days:

Volunteers help remove leaf litter, mow tall grass, and clear brush in public areas.

Create Tick-Safe Zones:

Use mulch or gravel barriers around fields and parks.

Deer Management:

Install deer-exclusion fencing or discuss humane deer population control strategies with wildlife agencies.

Phase 4: Targeted Pest Management

Pilot Programs:

Deploy rodent bait boxes treated with acaricides in key areas.

Biocontrol Trials:

Release beneficial nematodes or fungi in heavily infested areas (in coordination with local environmental scientists).

Phase 5: Monitoring and Research

Citizen Science Program:

Train volunteers to collect ticks at regular intervals and record locations.

Data Analysis:

Monitor changes in tick density and disease reports.

Annual Report:

Share progress and challenges with the community; adjust strategies as needed.

Phase 6: Policy Advocacy

Promote Tick-Safe Development:

Encourage developers to consider landscaping that discourages tick habitats.

Lobby for Support:

Advocate for sustainable tick control funding at the county or state level.

Timeline Example:

January: Form task force, begin education material creation

February: Launch education campaign, apply for grants

March: habitat management begins

April: Bait box deployment, biocontrol trials

May - September: Monitor ticks, public education continues

October: Analyze results, community feedback session

Key Principles:

Focus on sustainable, eco-friendly methods.

Emphasize community participation — no one homeowner or group can solve the problem alone.

Adjust based on real-world monitoring data, not assumptions.

Protect Our Community from Ticks!

Ticks Populations are on the rise — but together, we can fight back!

Join us in creating a safer, healthier environment for everyone.
Learn how YOU can help reduce ticks and the diseases they spread.

What You Can Do:

Tidy Up Yards:
Remove tall grass, leaf piles, and brush where ticks hide.

Create a Tick-Safe Zone:
Use mulch or gravel barriers between woods and play areas.

Protect Yourself:
Wear long sleeves, tuck pants into socks, and use insect repellent.

Check for Ticks Daily:
Especially after hiking, gardening, or playing outdoors.

"The parking at UW is THE ABSOLUTE WORST. Everybody saying “carpool” or “take a bus” are not listening to the actual problem. It supinely be this inconvenient to physically get to my place of employment. That’s bullshit. The bus is rarely on time and none of my neighbors work at UW, so carpooling is out of the question. The only way for many people to get to work at a consistent time everyday is driving.

If parking wasn’t bad enough, they tore down a huge garage near state street, then are partially closing other lots all in the same year. This caused a HUGE disruption in permit availability and it adds 30 minutes to my commute every single day. Now they are also asking many permit holders to leave their very expensive spot early for game days and other campus events.
Not only is the parking scarce, but now I have to drive through campus to get home. Driving through campus is my absolutely nightmare, people walking, biking and driving however they want to. It’s dangerous and it’s incredibly frustrating.

To everyone who must drive to work at UW: yes. It sucks but I also don’t see it ever improving because their lottery system is so weird.",reddit,downtown

"I transferred last year and couldn’t find any apartments I could afford near campus. I ended up moving to Sun Prairie, about 30 minutes from campus. I don’t love commuting, and the driving can be stressful sometimes, but at the end of the day I’m saving tons of money. You’ll never get a parking pass realistically, so plan for that. I park in the parking garage on Frances and State street, I’ve never had a problem finding a spot, especially in the mornings. My advice if you decide to commute is strategically plan your schedule. Take as many classes in a day as you realistically can without it being too much. I’ve managed to have no classes Fridays and only one on Wednesday this semester and it’s a blessing. I pay about $12 a day with classes from 9:30-3:45, it’s not cheap but if you’re not paying rent it could be worth it. At first I use to drive about 15 minutes to a bus stop and rode in from there, it took 45-60 minutes and I decided it wasn’t worth it to me and I’d rather drive.

Private apartment buildings send freshman and parents, especially those living out of state into a panic in Sept/Oct of first year.

I was a Bio major and don’t think I had many classes in the CALS area for the first few years (lots of chem, bio, physics all along University ave).  I was in Chadbourne and the location was centrally located between many classes, on the major bus lines, and near Helen C Library, State Street, Union, and Langdon St (what’s freshman year without a few frat parties?).  I also appreciated that they a had a dining hall, but was still very close to Southeast dorms for socializing, dining halls, and the Nick (rec center).

"No worries about the rant haha, I enjoy reading your perspective. Definitely too much to respond to everything but there’s a few general points I’ll add my perspective on…

&gt;I'd rather a kid raised by a single parent, than have to live in a household with abuse.  My grandmother was in that exact situation (alcoholic and abusive husband) and left my grandfather to protect their two kids, and she was ostracized from her parish for it.  

We’re in complete agreement on this, and every Catholic I know would also be in agreement on this. Any Catholic priest would encourage a wife who is in an abusive marriage to get out of that marriage. It’s likely it would qualify for an annulment by the church as well. I’m sorry thay happened to your grandmother, it should not have been that way. I would have to think it had more to do with strict standards of society in general at the time though and not to do with any time of Catholic doctrine. I would assume if she were Lutheran or Baptist the same situation would have occurred… not that that makes it ok that it did happen. 

&gt;Sex is supposed to be ""for"" procreation, therefore masturbation or gay sex or even just garden variety non-married sex are perversions of the natural act, diverting it away from it's teleological purpose of creating life. 

You’re misunderstanding the teaching on this a bit. The Catholic teaching on sex is that it should occur only within marriage (and marriage is an institution created by Christ between one man and one woman) and that has two aspects that must be met - the *unitive* and the *procreative*. If *either* of these aspects is missing, then it is a perversion of the intended meaning of sex and is therefore sinful. So having sex “just for procreation” is considered sinful. If there isn’t the intention to express deep love and commitment, it’s just as sinful as if there is an intention to unnaturally avoid pregnancy.  

&gt;There's anti-scientific sexism: this notion that the gender difference between men and women has some cosmic significance that means women can't be priests for example. Why not? ""Because Jesus was a man"" is what people tell me, but... so what? 

It’s not just that, but Jesus only chose men for his 12 apostles. We know that He had women among his followers, and was criticized by the Jewish establishment for it. He was already very progressive in that regard, and there’s no reason to think that if women were meant to be priests, he wouldn’t have selected women among the apostles for fear of the social standards at the time as He was already shirking them. Women already have special abilities granted by God that men do not have, chiefly the ability to create new life. A woman cannot become a priest just as a man cannot become a mother. 

&gt;Jesus was also a middle-eastern Jew, yet we let people of other races and ethnicities be priests, so clearly one doesn't have be exactly the same as Jesus to fill the role. Why would racial phenotypes not matter at all, but gender phenotypes are all-important? 

There’s a much larger difference between a man and a woman than between people of different ethnicities. 

&gt;it does sadden me that the Church would seemingly rather dwindle into an insignificant sect (at least in the US, I know it's strong internationally) than tolerate modern cultural attitudes about sex.

I really don’t think this is happening though…",reddit,general madison
"How many people were personally involved in all of those incidents combined?  100?  200?  How big is Baraboo?  14,000+.

It is basic math.  By your math/logic, Madison is a GOP stronghold because there is an active College Republicans chapter at UW Madison.  

Yes I'm going to take it personal when you resort to personal attacks about my reading comprehension skills, who I vote for (yes you still implied I voted for Trump - not 42 times, but c'mon that's implying that I support the man), and imply that I drive a F-150 without a Trump flag and am complicit in racism.  I find all of that very offensive.  I never got personal with you.

ALL of this just because you can't admit that Baraboo is no more racist than probably every other town in WI.  Baraboo can have racist people, but it isn't exclusive to them.  We need to make changes everywhere.

YES - what has happened is awful and needs to be called out, but people don't have to attack the whole community.  We can call out the bad actors and replace people in positions of power that are complicit.  THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING.  We have a majorly revamped school board and superintendent all AFTER the high school prom incident and the federal lawsuit started.  We have been so, so close to removing the Sauk County sheriff the past few elections.

Why can't both be true?  Baraboo has racist PEOPLE but the majority of Baraboo residents are good people.

"I'm not ducking anything, you're essentially, it seems, making a claim that highways are the pinnacle of transpiration financial self sufficiency that all other modes of transportation need to measure up to. Focusing on roads being funded by 50% user fees while ignoring all of the other hidden expenses put on the user as if those aren't hard earned dollars being spent too. Does it matter if you save 90$ on tax to rail networks but spend $500 on new tires, parking garage, insurance? Do you see my point? The goal is to allow for more accessible transportation options for everyone, not just those who can afford a car. It is not feasible to keep expanding highways, especially in more densely populated regions...like the upper Midwest and south central Wisconsin. Look at the Katy ""freeway"" in Houston and let me know if that is what you aspire Milwaukee or Madison to build. 

The routes that are being discussed aren't just made up fun ideas that haven't had years of careful consideration, town meetings and planning with local leaders, business owners and analysists, developers ect. Its not connecting two random towns, its the largest populations in the region. Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay, Eau Claire, Twin Cities. Millions of people. Look at the Hiawatha and Borealis with multiple daily trips and high ridership, the demand is there.

Sitting in traffic is an expense on worker productivity and quality of life. Expanding an 8 lane highway to 12 lanes and Eminent domaining 3 miles of property tax generating neighborhoods and businesses has a cost. These are all costs you aren't acknowledging in your argument. And as far as personal responsibility being crucial, it does not negate the structural problems with the system. Single vehicle crashes are often a result of infrastructure issues like bad road design, poorly maintained infrastructure, and traffic congestion. Not all accidents are preventable by personal behavior. Driver fatigue, other drivers’ mistakes, and unpredictable weather will always kill when the majority of the population is forced to drive.

 1% might seem small to you but it results in tens of thousands of lives a year because so many people are on congested roads. If we  expand another safer alternative, like rail, and we would bring that number down. But if our goal as a country is focusing on funding percentages and tax sources over human lives, this debate is going nowhere. In our society, I thought, human lives were most important, not marginal tax differences. I'm probably wrong. 

The hard numbers you are looking for and basing your argument on are...    ""**In commuter rail systems, fares typically cover about 30-50% of operating costs, with the rest subsidized by taxpayers. In light rail systems, fares cover a smaller portion, often around 20-40%, with the rest coming from subsidies. For intercity rail (like Amtrak), about 40-50% of operating costs are covered by passenger fares, with the remainder coming from government subsidies.""**

So what is the issue? Both roads and rail require tax subsidies. It's not a reason to hold back Wisconsin, or any other state who has majority support and favorability from voters, to expand transit in the form of efficient, on time, reliable regional rail networks for everyone.  

 The expectation that rail should cover 50% of its costs through fares is unrealistic, especially when considering that road networks are heavily subsidized and still don't pay for their full cost. Rail should be seen as an investment in the future of a more sustainable and less dangerous transportation system. We need a balance of maintained roads, safe airports, and efficient on time rail networks. If you want to highlight wasteful subsidies, I suggest you look at how much goes to oil and gas companies, or why we subsidize Walmart's low pay with taxpayer support to its workers. Stop looking at rail as a waste and instead what it is, a crucial transportation need for a strong economy.",reddit,general madison

"Okay, if no one else will say it, I’ll say it… Madison has an absolutely horrible business climate for development. Much of the effort and money spent by the city and county is most directly applied to making it harder for developers to put up housing that people actually want. 

So it’s much more complicated than simple low supply and high demand, this isn’t a free and open market. This is high and increasing demand with government intervention that has an absolute chokehold on supply. When you add in historically high building supply and labor prices also hampering supply, it’s a wonder anyone is building anything. You are correct that a lot of what has been built has been targeting students and at top of market prices, the current conditions that I described make that the only kind of development that makes financial sense. That same phenomenon has been going on for decades. If you ask alums from different eras, they will tell you it was The Embassy, The Aberdeen, the State Street Towers, etc. in their time. 

The other truth of the matter is that many students are not footing the bill for their housing, or are blissfully unaware of how much interest they are going to be paying on their Plus loans in order to live it up as undergrads. And that’s far from a new phenomenon too.",reddit,downtown

2.) You’ll call MPD and the dispatcher will ask you dumbass questions like “Well why exactly were you on state street?” “Why did it take you an hour to call.” 

3.) They’ll say “we’ll  investigate it,” hang up on you, and then go back to watching Netflix. All while many other police will be sitting around your location on their computers and phones ignoring everything around them.

4.) You will never get a call back. So you call. Your case doesn’t exist because the person you originally spoke to never documented it.

Lots of people will carry pepper spray on their keychains - because it’s always better to be safe than sorry. So I would recommend considering that and/or one of those alarms that you can carry on your keychain that when you pull it the alarm blares and a light flashes. 

In terms of places to avoid at night, I’d echo what someone else said - do not take the Lakeshore Path (no light), do not take the Bike Path (not well populated), be cautious on State Street, and stick to lit/busier areas. 

Overall, Madison feels pretty safe, but crimes do still happen here - as with anywhere else, so please be careful and take precautions.",reddit,downtown
"Hi! Recent grad here who worked at the Multicultural Student Center (MSC) Since you are a Posse scholar I wouldn’t worry too much about finding community with other POC in campus, ik a lot of posse scholars and they all really found their place thanks to posse and it being housed in the Red Gym/MSC. 

Definitely check out and connect with the Black Cultural Center downstairs from the posse office if you do apply. And attend MCOR/ the student org fair to connect with black student orgs. there are a lot of them plus multicultural Greek life if that’s something you might be interested in. Working at the MSC is honestly the best job I’ve ever had and also helps you connect a lot with other POC. 

That being said, you will most definitely feel the difference in lived experiences and cultural competency throughout your class discussions since most of your peers will be white and more often than not middle class to upper middle class. Some people (and unfortunately professors) here are just ignorant and others do a good job at hiding their racism/prejudice.

As a POC who got the global health certificate, classes were tolerable, some were really interesting. I’ll never forget my experience in Pop Health 370 as a freshman being the only POC in my discussion group of 14 white people (TA included) We would talk about health equity all the time but no one would bring up racial/ethnic health disparities besides me, I definitely felt a little pressured to represent my community and other POC as a whole in that class and many others. People in class  won’t actively exclude you. But in my experience it will feel alienating outside of the pockets of POC you will find, especially if you’re coming from a predominantly black/POC school.",reddit,campus

SYNOPSIS: Ian Cuypers was taken into custody for WI SS 946.41 Resisting or

Obstructing an officer following a high risk traffic stop in the 2000 block of John

Ave. Cuypers was not following officer commands and displayed furtive movements

during the stop. A Conducted Energy Weapon (Taser) was subsequently used to take

Cuypers into custody. Cuypers was transported to Douglas County Jail, then brought

back to his vehicle and released from custody. Citations for City Ordinance 102-1

Resist or Obstruct an Officer and WI SS 346.04(2) Driving Against Traffic (One Way

Street) have been placed into the records department outgoing mailbox.

NARRATIVE:

On 2/28/2024, at approximately 2216 hours, I, Officer Taylor, observed a dark

colored Pontiac traveling northbound on Tower Ave in the 2700 block at what appeared

to be a high rate of speed compared to other traffic on the roadway going the same

direction.

I was on duty as a Police Officer in the City of Superior, Douglas County, WI, in

full police uniform, operating marked squad 33.

I attempted to catch up with the vehicle, which turned eastbound onto N 23rd St, and

then northbound onto Ogden Ave before turning eastbound on N 21st St. The vehicle

came to a complete stop in the 1600 block of N 21st St, and then turned north onto

John Ave going against one way traffic. I initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle

for this offense. The vehicle, bearing MN NLN435, stopped in the 2000 block of John

Ave.

After the vehicle stopped, I observed a lot of movement inside of the vehicle by the

driver. Specifically, the driver was reaching over to the passenger side of the

vehicle, and ducked down several times. This led me to believe the driver may be

reaching for a weapon, or attempting to conceal something. Due to this, I requested

additional officers to respond. I took up a position on the rear passenger side of

my squad car and maintained a visual of the vehicle. The driver continued to reach

around the vehicle while I waiting of officers to arrive.

02/29/24

Sgt Brown arrived on scene first, followed by Ofc Gaard, Ofc Moen, and Ofc Crist. We

set up to conduct a high risk stop on the driver due to his furtive movement. I was

on the passenger side of my squad car with Ofc Gaard and Ofc Moen. I drew my

department issued firearm to provide lethal cover. I gave loud verbal commands to

the driver, directing him to step out of the vehicle with his hands up, facing away

from officers. I had to tell the driver to face away from officers multiple times,

as well as keep his hands up on his head due to him dropping his hands several

times. I directed the driver to walk backwards towards officers, again having to

repeat commands several times due to the driver speaking over my commands. The

suspect walked backwards very quickly, I directed him to slow down and keep facing

away from officers. Once the male reached the front driver's side of my squad car,

Sgt Brown took over commands as he was closer to the suspect. The suspect was

directed multiple times to go to his knees to enter into a compliant position to be

handcuffed. The male did not, and attempted to look back towards officers and

dropped his hands from his head, even taking the bandanna on his head off and

throwing it away from himself. Ofc Gaard deployed her Conducted Energy Weapon

(Taser) to the suspect's back area with two cartridges, causing neuromuscular

incapacitation which then caused him to fall to the ground onto his stomach. Ofc

Moen and I applied handcuffs to the suspect's wrists behind his back (cfdl) while he

was on the ground. I conducted a pat down for weapons on the suspect, not finding

any.

While officers were directing the suspect into a position to bring him to his feet,

the suspect said something to his effect of ""I can't feel my legs."" When asked if he

needed medical attention, he would not give an answer of yes or no and instead

asked about the cost for that service. The suspect was then assisted to his feet by

myself and Officer Moen by lifting him up. While we were lifting the suspect, my

body worn camera became dislodged and fell to the ground. Officers then moved the

suspect behind my squad car to remove the Taser probes. The Taser probes penetrated

the skin of the suspect's mid back, lower back, and the rear of his left leg above

the knee. The probes were removed by Ofc Gaard. The probe barbs were intact, and the

probes and wires were collected by Ofc Gaard.

Sgt Brown very directly asked the suspect if he required medical attention. The

suspect then said ""nah, no.""

I then conducted a search incident to lawful arrest, finding nothing of evidentiary

value. The entry wound on the suspect's mid back was photographed. The other entry

wounds were not photographed due to being in locations which would unnecessarily

expose the suspect.

The suspect gave other officers consent to enter his vehicle to locate his ID. While

officers were looking for that, I escorted the suspect to the rear passenger seat

of my squad car (33) with the interior camera activated. At the request of Sgt

Brown, I asked the suspect if he wanted his wallet or just the ID, which he wanted

the entire wallet. The suspect was then identified by MN DL as Ian Cuypers. Sgt

Brown gained consent from the suspect to turn his vehicle off and lock it, after the

suspect requested the vehicle be parked where it was. I then took custody of the

suspect's car keys, wallet, and the bandanna. While other officers were clearing,

Cuypers noticed a light was still on inside of his vehicle. I gathered his consent

to enter his vehicle to turn the light off.

I then transported Cuypers to the Douglas County Jail. When I arrived at the jail,

Sgt Brown spoke with me about Cuypers' lack of criminal history. Due to this, I made

the decision to not lodge Cuypers into jail, and instead issue citations instead. I

escorted him into the pre-booking room to complete the associated citations. Due to

Tracs not working on the computer in pre-booking, I was unable to complete the

citations in person. I informed Cuypers he would be receiving two citations the

mail. I walked Cuypers back to my squad car after I gathered his contact

information. I then transported him back to his vehicle in the 2000 block of John

Ave, where I had Ofc Collins meet me for officer safety. Cuypers was taken out of

custody, and his property was given back to him.

Tracs citation BJ272090 and 6Z8056RQ7W have been placed in the police records

department outgoing mailbox.

OFFICER: Taylor 4545

This is MY report of the occasion.

Time: 10:15 PM

Ian takes a left turn, going the wrong way down a one way, mistaking it for the proper street on the map.

On my way to 2101 John Ave. Superior , Wisconsin, 54880, US , 2 minutes away.

Officer Taylor Turns on his lights, Ian begins to look for his insurance, going through papers in the glovebox. Multiple more squad cars surround Pontiac G6 with Ian inside.

Ian rolls down his window to greet officers, hears the order “Show me your hands” Ian puts his head and hands outside the window to comply. Ian hears orders “Keep your hands outside the vehicle , open it from the outside.” Ian responds “My door is locked” Ian is afraid of moving his hands to unlock the door. As they must be held up.

Officer gives order “unlock your door” Ian unlocks his door and exits vehicle, hands up. Officers order Ian to place hands on head and walk backwards, he is not under arrest. Ian asks ‘What did I do?”While hands are on his head and his back is facing the officers. Ian receives the order to place his hands on his head for a second time, his hands are already on his head and he is walking backwards. Ian replies “they are on my head, what did I do?” “Why are there so many officers?”

Ian once again receives the orders to place hands on head and walk backwards for the third time, making him question what else he can do to convey compliance. “I just want to know what’s going on.” He has his hands above his head and his back turned. He receives the order that if he does not comply he will be tased. He is immediately tased following the command. Ian falls to the ground, convulsing and screaming in pain and several officers get on top of him and restrain him, grab his limbs and place him in handcuffs. While this was happening Ian stated. “I am going to die, what did I do?”

Ian was asked if he needed any medical aid, Ian said “Can I get medical help? What does that mean?” One responded that they call in ambulance in such a case, Ian can not afford an ambulance. The officers place ian against the police car to search him.

Ian has no weapons, Ian is asked by one officer if there is anyone else in the car. Ian says “No” Another officer yells at the car “We know you’re in there, exit the vehicle” Ian is told by another officer he needs to give a more clear answer. After it is established no one is in Ian’s car Ian says “Look I really don’t know what this is all about I am trying to be compliant” A female officer tells Ian he is not trying to be compliant. This is followed by Ian asking “Can someone tell me what this is for? Am I under arrest?” One officer said yes to me, another officer corrected him. They said “No, he’s not under arrest yet.” Another officer responds to me that they would tell me what this was about later.

After that, all five police officers placed me on the back door of their squad car and gathered to look at the tase marks they left on Ian’s back. The sergeant was educating them about the effects it had on Ian’s skin. Their sergeant is there and tells them they all handled the situation properly. Ian was looking into the sergeants body camera at this point. This happened a moment before they put Ian in the back of their squad car.

The officers then asked if Ian gave consent to go into his car, to retrieve his wallet and phone to bring to the jailhouse with him. He consented and asked if he was under arrest, two officers gave a definite yes. Officer Taylor was one of them. Ian was brought to the jailhouse where after a long conversation with his superior, officer Taylor took me out of the squad car and into the interrogation/jail room, where Ian asked if he could use the bathroom and his request was denied. He was sat there in handcuffs for about 20 minutes while Officer Taylor explained he was not going to put Ian in jail but instead issue a citation. Ian asked about the Taser wounds and Officer Taylor explained that usually they have to take pictures of taser marks but he wanted to get Ian out of there so he wasn’t going to push it. Ian requested that pictures do be taken, in case his wounds become infected. And his request was brushed off. Before leaving the police station Ian asked about his phone, which he requested be brought to the jail with him. To which Officer Taylor replied it was still in Ian’s possession. Ian was escorted back into the back of the squad car where he received a ride back to the arrest site. At the site he was instructed that we had to wait for another squad car to arrive before they could let me loose. After another Officer arrived Ian was allowed to exit his handcuffs and was given back his wallet, keys, and bandana. He was left alone when he realized he did not have his phone. He had to find the local police station at around 11 at night, when everything is closed, and he couldn’t get directions. He got his phone back but the officers had lost it first.

And I wrote that after I got back home that night. I have proof. It doesn't match the video exactly because I was very shaken up and couldn't remember everything as it was very confusing, and I think I got a concussion. 

I have pictures of my wounds and my chin was bruised and my wrists were scuffed up.",reddit,general madison
"All depends on what you're used to. If you're an only child who grew up in the middle of nowhere, you might be uncomfortable.

"As a graduate student, McBurney has been amazing for me. However, everyone’s disabilities, histories, and degrees/ majors can vary wildly. UW is a big school (with even online degrees, masters, PhDs, undergrad, and probably programs/ departments I did not know existed. Additionally, professors have a lot of say with the democratic policies they have (which are innovative imo). Those democratic policies, like everything, will have their pluses and minuses. 

My suggestion is that you talk to each disability resource center and search the internet for posts like this for every school you are considering. Then see what accommodations, etc look like. Ask for examples, talk to departments, understand how they will handle professor disagreements, ask to speak with current students (doesn’t have to be disabled, you just need a read on the faculty), and their general policies.

Then do a pro/cons chart to help you decide.

Ultimately, there is no way to be sure. Disability resource centers and departments vary too widely to know how each case will go down. However, if you stay transparent (which seems like you are), keep good documentation, try to plan ahead (like you probably already do), come up with plans for how to word emails and navigate things related to self advocacy- you will be successful many places. 

Best of luck!",reddit,general madison
"I wouldn't recommend taking more than 6 credits during the standard 8 week term. There are a bunch of different terms, but the vast majority of classes take place from the middle of June through the middle of August. It would be weird if you did all of the terms since a few of them overlap and you'd have no breaks at all during the summer. The courses are roughly twice the speed of regular courses, though it can feel faster than that since you won't get as much practice material in addition to covering all the main topics in just over half the time. 

I haven't dormed over the summer, nor have I picked up a sublease. Campus is pretty dead compared to the rest of the year, but there are still people.

"OP didn't ask for advice about swimming in moving water. Knowing how to do something and knowing well enough to teach over a reddit comment are way different. Try again. 

  
I didn't claim lakes are terrifying as a universality. I shared that, as someone who grew up without exposure to lakes, they terrify me, specifically, in particular, because of the lack of access when I was learning to swim. Swing and a miss. 

  
The relevancy is that, in a flat water dominated state, swimming knowledge is generally flat water, not rivers. The point being, I'll happily evaluate moving water for myself because I'm familiar. I won't do that in still water because,  even having lived here a long time, i don't understand lakes all that well. Spring fed and temperature gradients and all. Yeah,  I'll need a guide for that.

"&gt; Well what characteristics would you generally associate with someone you would perceive as a man? What are those characteristics in someone you would perceive as a woman?

They would be physical traits, of the sexes. Broad shoulders, large hand/foot size, Adam's apple, masculine facial structure, hip/torso makeup, hairy arms/legs, etc. for males. Breasts, feminine facial structure, hip/torso makeup, narrow shoulders, smoother skin, walking gait  etc. This is perception, not declaration. Children of the age of two can discern between male and female faces. Wrong assumptions can be made. And these are generalizations as a category, not to define individuals by. It's not that hairy arms make someone a man. But that men typically have hairy arms compared to women.

And this same view is adopted by many transgender people that demand such physical changes to be what ""affirms"" their gender identity. I would just claim that the categories are based on natural development, not medical alteration. In the same manner skin color may help use discern race, but a unnatural alteration to such wouldn't alter one's race.

Or if ""presentation"" is so desired to adopt such new perception and language,  then focus on the SOCIAL function of that, rather than still diverting back to self-ID as to be inclusive of even those that simply claim it.

This is a binary classification, not a means of expressing your unique and complex individual identity. 

&gt; We are exposed to societal messaging from a young age that informs our understanding of gender and how it relates to our self

Again, gender norms don't inform gender identity. Effeminate gay males that only have female friends, love shopping, and cry often are not women. 

Sure, a small boy may STRUGGLE being outside such a norm, but such challenging of their IDENTITY seems like such a toxic response.

Me hating the color pink as a young boy was a DUMB schema I adopted that I grew out of. I wasn't a boy because I didn't like pink. I was DECLARED a boy and thus based my perspective on that. I never identified as a boy, it was simply what I was deemed. Accepting that doesn't make one cis. It's an ideological application to respond in that way as a form of identity.

&gt; We all make assumptions based on presentation everyday. That's not bias. That's us gaining an understanding of how people behave in society through observation as we grow up.

I'm not challenging that one can observe how men are normally treated and desire the same. I'm arguing that such a preference shouldn't inform yourself to BE a man. Opposing the idea to think you can simply declare to be a man to be treated like such rather than recognized as a man by others so they treat you in that way. Or, by simply requesting others treat you in that way, without demanding they associate you to a classification.

There's a huge difference between observing a norm, compared to then applying it as if a rule. 

Also, I'm  a bit confused on how you are assuming other's gender identities to make declarations based on gender rather than perceiving their sex. 

&gt; You don't know your co-workers chromosomes. You probably don't even know your own. 

And you don't know your co-workers gender identity, yet you freely make assumptions of what this collective is. My point is that society treats those they perceive as, or know are, a specific SEX a certain way. Not based on how they identify.

If you wanted to be treated like a girl, fine. My objection is to identifying as a girl based on such. It seems fully narcissistic to me to declare a self-ID to such societal classifiers. I would enjoy having some sweet ""girl time"" with a group of girls. But simply identifying as a girl, seems an underhanded way of acheiving such an accomodation from women. I simply oppose the idea that a self-ID should change how others perceive me. Altering myself to appear as a female, still seems a bizarre way to acheive that, but at least may attempt an actual social mechanism. But still seems improper to assume anything. I should need affirmation from all, not impose anything on others.

I *don't* know my own chromosomes. That doesn't matter. Like I've been arguing, my identity is SOCIAL. I don't claim to be a man, I'm declared to be a man. I accept the concept that man presents my *supposed* male sex. If you consider ""man"" to be a gender identity. Conveying something that is not from my sex, then I would favor not being referred to as a man by you. At least until we can agree on what you are desiring to say about me. These classifers are not for me to claim, but to utilize to convey understanding. 

&gt; But that does not invalidate trans people

I'm not invalidating them. Im questioning the application of a personal identity to a concept of gender being imposed on as a social identity. If you wish to perceive it it that way, please state I'm invalidating the many more people who identify as cisgender. Because they are a group I don't understand either. At least transgender people have the excuse of trying to understand such a grave disconnect through any means they can.

I just think it's toxic to abuse self identity to group classifiers in this way. You can have you PERSONAL desires. To challenge gender norms. To have sex based body dysmorphia. To wish to be perceived differently, and setting on answers around societal norms. But social labels are societal, to be administered, not be self-claimed. To be checked and given the allowance to deny. That's just my fundemental perspective.",reddit,general madison

She had a heart attack when she was 51, and the costs set her and my dad back (ambulance ride to the local hospital (half an hour away), another ambulance to Duluth (almost two hours) because the local hospital couldn't handle heart attack patients, stent surgery and stay at the hospital in Duluth, after care and medication with her local GP). She went back to work on light duty within a week and ""light duty"" became regular duty just because they were short staffed. She retired the day she turned 65 because she was again taken to the hospital by ambulance for heart problems the week before that, and she couldn't have a gap in pay between when she retired and when Social Security kicked in. 

This is one of the things that's not factored in when we discuss a salary to ""live comfortably."" Just trying to **live** can be in the hundreds of thousands or - for some unfortunate families - millions of dollars because of their health care needs on top of the usual food, rent, heat, electric, etc. My parents live in a crappy house in a tiny, dying village in the boonies, so their ""costs"" aren't as high as Madison or Milwaukee, or even Eau Claire. They're still just barely squeaking by when you ignore their medical debt. Anyone can say, ""Oh, I'm healthy, I don't drink or do drugs, so I'm good to go on $40K a year"" and then suddenly find themself in a car accident they weren't at fault in, or with cancer, or with a baby in NICU. If you're truly ""living comfortably,"" you have enough to cover those things, and most Wisconsinites (or Americans, for that matter) frankly don't.",reddit,general madison

"rapid fire: 

if its the only full ride you got, take it (from someone who also got a full ride here). diversity isn't stellar but its far from awful. you will find your people and racism happens everywhere but theres tons of cultural clubs and places to connect with you community. many things on campus are inclusive, some are not. 

the campus thrives around the lake, football games are nice, party culture is good, and tons to do in the city. housing is mostly doubles/triples with one bathroom for the hall or a shared bathroom for a few rooms. also hard to get housing after freshman year, most get apartments. you don't really get your top pick. switching majors depends on the program. some are quite competitive. kpop fans are around you might just have to look. dining hall food isn't awesome but it's edible and tasty enough. plenty of study abroad opportunities both through your major or other opportunities, locations vary on those. not hard to make friends if you dont party, but it is popular. 

it does feel very big at times but you will adjust, if you need alone time there are nature trails and meditation spots at one of the gyms, but sometimes just being alone in your room is  enough. there are only a handful of dance crews that accept real beginners, most of the competitive ones require auditions. im surprised you dont know how good the school is academically if you applied but yes, its no harvard but its very reputable and rigorous, although major impacts this somewhat. it is harder to find jobs/internships outside of wisconsin while attending. staff and school have a lot of opportunities, but you have to actually seize them. easy to find part time jobs, some suck more than others. good luck!",reddit,campus

"Illegal cicada poaching on mass scale happening at Big Foot Beach State Park in Lake Geneva **This is my account from speaking directly with State Park staff witnesses who want our help**

Hi everyone, I'm a first-time visitor to your state. Like many others I came to Wisconsin and Big Foot Beach State Park for the cicadas. In fact, it was the friendly folks in this particular subreddit that recommended the park.

Big Foot Beach State Park is home to all three of the 17 year periodical cicada species Magicicada cassini, septendecula, and septendecim. **All 3 species are listed on the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened**, and it's expected that since the last population count 17 years ago they've declined further due to habitat loss. This is important and will become even more so as you read on.

On June 17th 2024 I met 3 staff members at on site at Big Foot Beach State Park in Lake Geneva Wisconsin, who told me that for the past 3 weeks illegal killing / poaching has been occurring on the property at a mass scale, and it is not being stopped or addressed by their assigned DNR Conservation Warden (Law Enforcement Southeast Region &gt; Waukesha Walworth Team).

The three Big Foot Beach staff members I spoke with approached me because they are also big fans of the cicadas. They are all naturalists and scientists who are well aware of the important ecological role of periodical cicadas. They are also incredibly upset because every morning there are people showing up who are ripping the wings off of the cicadas, throwing them in 5 gallon buckets, and leaving the park to sell them for a profit at wet markets in Milwaukee and Chicago. They come in groups, several in a car. They said they started coming at the beginning of the emergence about 3 ago and they come every morning, leaving with multiple 5 gallon buckets full of the mutilated cicadas.

This happens every morning, and has been ongoing since the Cicadas first emerged 3 weeks ago. The staff said that people started killing them as soon as they emerged, before the insects were able to find mates, and every day since. They believe the future generations are already severely compromised by the killings that have already occurred.

The 3 staff members I spoke with said they are very distressed about this but when they and their manager have tried to address it, they've been unsupported by the DNR Conservation Warden. For reference, the DNR Conservation Warden is THE person staff calls if there is illegal activity in the park.

I asked the employees why no one is stopping the people killing the cicadas. They said that they were told there was nothing that could be done about it because their assigned Conservation Warden said they are ""nuisances”. They said they feel totally powerless, and that they are deeply upset to see carloads of people come every day to kill the cicadas, while families who have brought their children to see and learn about them are also there seeing them do it. They admitted that the only people who had asked the poachers to stop killing the cicadas were guests of the park who had come with their families–not any staff or the DNR Conservation Warden. What a horrible position to be put in.

I told Park staff that this “nuisance” response from the Conservation Warden didn't sound right to me, and that every state has rules and laws against taking natural materials and animals from state lands. I asked them if they knew how to access those laws. They did not, so I showed them and we talked about it. They said they thought their Warden's job was to address problems like this and they didn't know why he wasn't listening to them or helping.

Wisconsin DNR and extensions do give guidelines to the public about specific ""nuisance animals"", but cicadas are not among them. I believe the language is being grievously misused here. In all documentation disseminated by the DNR, periodical cicadas are not listed as nuisance animals. And even for animals that **are** listed, there is nothing permitting the public to show up and kill them on state park land without a license or written permission.

See [this DNR resource](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/WildlifeHabitat/damage) and [this extension resource](https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/periodical-cicadas/). 

In fact, is illegal for anyone to take wildlife out of a state park without a permit, or explicit written permission.

The state laws are [here](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/nr/001/45/04) (page takes some time to load).

The relevant sections are NR 45.04 General Rules, State Property:

NR 45.04  General rules.
(1)  State property.
(a) No person may destroy, molest, deface, **remove** or attempt to remove any natural growth or **natural or archaeological feature** except as follows: (specific growths and features made explicit) 
(f) No person may transplant, **relocate**, stock or release any plant or **animal**, domesticated or wild, **without written permission from the department**.

I personally made a call to the confidential DNR violation hotline at 1-800-847-9367, press 2.

I told the park staff I did and they were glad I called it in. 

Wisconsin Reddit, I may be a visitor but I care a lot about your parks and the people who work there. They are feeling really unsupported by DNR right now, the very organization with people with titles like **Conservation** Warden who are supposed to be helping protect your precious natural resources. 

And as I mentioned before, all three species in the park are *already* vulnerable and declining. I know some days it probably seems like we have an endless supply of the cicadas, but we really don't, and their habitat shrinks every year. 

Can y'all help and call DNR? They want to ignore us and say it doesn't matter because they're “just bugs”. It is a violation according to state law, and they need to enforce the law. They want to claim that there are no rules or provisions that protect insects, but there are also no explicit rules or provisions that protect any mammals, fish, or birds. Instead, the law just uses the word ""animal"", and insects are animals. We even have many insects that are protected by the Endangered Species Act.

And you *know* if someone showed up at Big Foot tomorrow and just started shooting every mammal they saw, action would be taken right away! In fact, action would even be taken right away if people showed up and started digging up the flowers.

Please call the Wisconsin DNR Violation hotline and report a violation. Even though they are claiming it is not a violation please remind them 1) of the law and 2) that the law does not have any specific rules or provisions for mammals, birds, or fish either, the law only states that *animals*, which include insects, may not be removed without explicit written permission.

Violation Hotline:  1-800-847-9367, press 2

Thanks so much for reading and helping.

Personally, my first-time visit to Wisconsin and Big Foot went quickly from a dream to a nightmare, but I really am hoping some good can come out of this. Thanks again.",reddit,park street
"Open Letter Regarding Public School Funding Open Letter Regarding Public School Funding, emailed to the recipients today on a day I took off work:

Dear Representative  Ellen L. Schutt and Senator Steve Nass  

I am a constituent of State Congressional District 31 and State Senate District 11, living in the town of La Grange, Wisconsin with a child in the Elkhorn Area School District. I am writing to you to urge you to introduce and/or support any legislation that returns state funding to Wisconsin school districts and schools.  Funding quality education for our children without forcing districts to seek referendums and/or raise property taxes shouldn't be controversial or political. It is the correct, moral and practical solution to apply the surplus to education. Especially when the state already has the means to do so, but the legislature just chooses not to.  

We moved to Elkhorn from West Allis just before the 2022 - 2023 school year. The schools here are an amazing improvement because they have been better funded and managed than our previous school district. The teachers and schools provide excellent communication and follow up. They provide a vast array of subjects and opportunities that the West Allis-West Milwaukee School District simply didn't have the resources to provide. While I may occasionally take issue with some district policy, my daughter's principle Ryan McBurney has always been responsive to our questions or concerns about our daughter's education, and her teachers both last year and this year have genuine interest in seeing her succeed especially her English Teacher last year Courtney Dopke, her Science Teacher this year Linda Frakenberg, and her Choir Teacher (and musical director) Matthew Remus. Ms. Dopke connected with our daughter, Grace, because of a shared love of reading; and even outside of class work Ms. Dopke and Grace would give each other book recommendations. Grace likes to call Ms. Frankenberg the ""school mom"" to the whole cohort. She is emotionally invested in seeing each and every one of her students succeed.  Mr. Remus is always running because he teaches both at the High School and Middle School, as well as directs the Middle School Honors Choir, Middle School Jazz Ensemble and Middle School Musical after school. He pushes his students to do their best, and it paid off in his student's progress. The Jazz Ensemble recently received the highest score possible (I\*) at WSMA competition and will be competing in the state WSMA competition. I could go on singing the praises of Grace's other teachers at Elkhorn, really I could because they all have earned my respect and admiration.  

Sadly, the Elkhorn Area School District currently faces a shortfall of $1.2 million dollars. The last election cycle they placed a referendum asking the citizens who live in the district to raise property tax to make up the difference. The referendum failed, because the district has a lot of older residents and a lot of people who are unwilling to pay higher property taxes (which have been going up, because property values have been going up, partially because the school district is good). Just before we left West Allis-West Milwaukee they also had two school budget referendums fail. They have not had the money to properly pay teachers, or perform much needed renovations on their aging buildings. Part of their solution for the last decade to their budget issues has included ""right sizing"" and not rehiring some valuable positions, replacing teachers retiring, leaving the district and/or leaving the profession with new teachers who they could pay less money to. The result of that policy in the long term is that the district has trouble attracting teachers, and an even harder time retaining them. Often, the best new teachers they did get would leave after getting their ""2 years experience"" that other higher-paying districts were looking for. These are the same solutions the Elkhorn Area School District is being forced into considering. It saddens me that when Linda Frakenberg retires at the end of the year, after giving the district 35 years, that she might be replaced by the cheapest candidate instead of the best candidate for the job. I am sure no one wants that, but those might be the fiscal realities -- not just in Elkhorn, but across the state. You, the Wisconsin State Assembly and Wisconsin Senate have the power and the resources to fix this problem without raising taxes.  

In the last two years, there have been 248 referendums school districts have placed on ballots (that includes 92 referenda on the ballot in just a few weeks). The sheer number of referenda indicate that this isn't about a failing in those districts, but a failing of the state to fund education. It is an indictment of the legislature and their inability or unwillingness to invest in the next generation.  The state limits the methods available to districts to raise funds themselves, and requires them to seek these referenda. The current referendums total $1.4 billion and that is on top of $2 billion that was asked for in fall of 2022. Meanwhile the state sits on a surplus of $7.1 billion last year and an estimated $6.6 billion. Our schools need money for the maintenance, equipment, and labor costs associated with providing children with an education. The state has the money, without raising taxes, but continues to defund education to the detriment of our children. The math works out that the state could fully fund the shortfalls of all the school districts in the state, and still have surplus. To not invest in the public education of children of Wisconsin is unconscionable and immoral, especially as the state legislature is pushing to spend more taxpayer money on private (sometimes for-profit, and often religious) education.  

I don't feel like I should have to explain why education is important, but I fear that a small reminder is necessary in the current environment. Even citizens who don't have children benefit from living in society with free access to quality education. Studies indicate that higher access to educational opportunities, the better quality of education, and higher educational attainment are all causally associated with lower poverty rate, the lower crime and violent crime rates, the higher median incomes, and higher the standards of living in the area. The states that top the list for highest crime rates and most poverty are also the states that have the lowest investments in education and lowest educational outcomes. Those states also lead the nation in maternal and infant mortality, teen pregnancy rates, and have the lowest life expectancies in the nation. It isn't the people that live there that cause those statistics to be true, it is the sustained decision of the state governments not to fund public goods, like and especially education, that has a clear negative impact on the lives of citizens.  

This letter, and eventually your carefully considered responses, will be posted publicly. I urge any and all Wisconsin citizens who care about the quality of public education, crime rates, poverty rate or their property tax bill to contact their state representative and senator expressing your desire for the state to reinvest in education. Anyone interested can find your representative's contact information at [https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/legislators/assembly](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2023/legislators/assembly) \-- and if you need to find out who your state representative and senator are you find out at [https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/My-Elected-Officials](https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/My-Elected-Officials) .

"I can't speak to your academic goals/program or to what UW is like as an undergrad but I can speak to the benefit of the financial offer you're receiving here. I went to a very mid state school for undergrad in the middle of nowhere because I was offered $36,000 in scholarships and received more later in my academic career. I have very modest student loan debt now because of that decision (as well as working three jobs). If I had decided to aim for a more prestigious school I would have been paying way more and it would have been out of pocket. My parents didn't have college savings so I'd have substantial debt while making garbage pay in grad school. I also ended up with a lot of academic opportunities (all of my jobs and a bunch of really random experience in my major and other leadership positions) because I went to a less prestigious school. ""Big fish, small pond"" instead of ""medium fish, huge pond"". 

I have a couple questions that hopefully are helpful. With the caveat that I didn't need the networking component that you will need for your chosen field of study so if that weighs more heavily, absolutely center that priority. 

1) do you have money to pay for those more prestigious schools? Or will you be saddled with loans after graduating? If so, how much of a burden will that be to pay back on your career path?

2) is it typical with IR that you will have to get a graduate degree after? If so, bear in mind that the prestige of your graduate school usually has a higher impact on your career path than your undergrad. 

3) are you aware that UW is actually decently prestigious? It's what's considered a public ivy. Funnily enough, a disproportionate amount of professors in the US come from UW and a handful of other schools. 

4) did you visit campus at all? Did you like it? Can you see yourself living here for 4 years? 

5) is there any benefit to being in the state capitol for your career path? Cause well, that's where we are lol 

In the end, you are the one who will have to go to the school you pick. Not your family, not you guidance counselor, not anybody else who has these preconceived expectations about you. Choose a school where you are safe (physically and financially), where you are well provided for, and where your academic needs are met. If I were in your position, UW would have been that school for me and 4.5 years after undergrad I don't regret choosing a school that was ""cheap"" for me.

"Kronshage - Conover I felt it my duty to come on here and talk about my experience in Kronshage during the 23-24 school year. I am an out of state student and literally never saw the campus until I moved in and picked random dorms for my preferred list. Yet, Kronshage was not one of them and I still got placed in Conover. I was actually so upset cause it seemed like it was gonna be a sucky dorm. But I knew I couldn’t change it so I sucked it up and moved in. And after living there for a school year I can say I would not want to live in any other dorm. Things I loved Kronshage: the rooms are huge and you only have to share it with one other person, the bathrooms are communal but updated and clean 90% of the time AND I never had to wait to use any of the bathroom things, being right on the lakeshore path was so nice, being right next to the Bakke is ever nicer, Carson’s and Four Lakes are good dinning halls, being a 3 minute walk from a bus stop, study spaces were empty 70% of the time, the kitchen was super nice, and the laundry was in my basement. I could go on I really did enjoy my dorm experience and I believe no matter where you are on campus you’ll find it to be good. 

The only thing I feel can make or break a dorm situation is your roommate/s. I was lucky and had a great random roommate but I could understand if your roommate is a nightmare you may not like the dorm. So to all the people that are going to be a roommate PLEASE be considerate, the world does not revolve around you and you will have to make sacrifices. Being a roommate doesn’t have to suck so please always think about the people you are living with.

"It’s naive to think everyone here that is saying “aLl LaNeS aRe FoR tHe SpEeD lImIt” drive the speed limit 100% of the time so stop with that.  It’s really pretty simple when you look at Wisconsin law: 

346.05(3) “Any vehicle proceeding upon a roadway at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available for traffic, or as close as practicable to the right-hand edge or curb of the roadway”

If you more thoroughly read [346.05](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/346/ii/05) it is referencing the flow of traffic and not even the speed limit which leaves open to interpretation the circumstances of traffic in real time.

[“Driving in the left lane for anything other than passing is not only illegal in a growing number of states it’s unsafe and results in thousands of accidents annually, according to a study by the Traffic Operations and Safety Laboratory within the engineering department at UW Madison”](https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SLOWER-TRAFFIC-KEEP-RIGHT.pdf)

Like what else needs to be argued?  They’re clearly standardizing the slow lane so that everyone going relatively slower keeps right to avoid backups and safety issues through uniformity.  You can get where you’re going safely going 78 or 70 but impeding the flow of traffic because you’re trying to prove a point you are also by definition breaking the law, a safety risk and part of the problem.",reddit,general madison

WISCONSIN
Nearly 10% of hospital jobs in Wisconsin are vacant, report says
PeterMarch 11, 2024

Nearly 10% of Wisconsin hospital jobs are vacant, nearly double the rate since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a workforce shortage that remains critical as an aging population demands more attention, according to a Monday report from the Wisconsin Hospital Association.

Licensed practical nurses have the highest vacancy rate at 18%, followed by certified registered nurse anesthetists at 14% and certified nursing assistants, or CNAs, at more than 12%.

The state’s vacancy rate for registered nurses, who make up half of the hospital workforce, is 10%, higher than in previous years but lower than the national rate of 16%.

People are also reading…

“Wisconsin hospitals are working hard to grow, recruit, retain and support the health care workforce necessary to maintain the high-quality health care that Wisconsinites expect and deserve,” said Ann Zenk, senior vice president of WHA. , it’s a statement. “But even with intense effort, it is unlikely that the healthcare workforce can grow fast enough to meet the growing demand for healthcare from an aging population.”







University of Washington Hospital
UW Health is planning expansions for University Hospital, pictured above, on Madison’s west side and East Madison Hospital, citing “dramatic increases” in demand for services. The proposed expansion for UW Hospital would include 22 emergency rooms, 22 flexible care beds and 48 inpatient rooms.

The report, which primarily uses data from September 2022, the most recent period available, comes after Gov. Tony Evers announced a health care workforce task force in January, with Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, a nurse. titled, as president. Members of the task force, announced in February, include leaders from state health agencies and state-level health care organizations, along with administrators from some hospitals, such as Shawn Lerch, CEO of Sauk Prairie Healthcare, and Sharon Cox, director of nursing at Beloit Health System.

In January, Hospital Sisters Health System, based in Springfield, Illinois, said it would close HSHS St. Joseph Hospital in Chippewa Falls and HSHS Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire. Physician partner Prevea Health said it would also close its locations in Chippewa Valley in western Wisconsin.

The Chippewa Falls hospital is expected to close on March 22 and the Eau Claire hospital is expected to close on April 21. HSHS cited “prolonged operational and financial stress related to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, inflation, workforce limitations, local market challenges, and other industry issues.” broad trends.

The WHA report calls the HSHS closures “unthinkable.”

“Staffing shortages are part of a cascade of challenges: a vicious cycle that includes rising workforce costs without concomitant increases in reimbursements, financial and workforce limits on capacity and services, and even unthinkable: the first hospital closures in Wisconsin in more than a decade. ”says the report.

“Hospitals and health systems must be helped to break this treacherous feedback loop,” the report says.

The overall hospital vacancy rate in September 2022 was 9.9%, the same as the previous year and up from 5.3% in September 2020 and 5.7% in September 2019.

SSM Health will build a clinic in Verona

Data for September 2023 is not available. Zenk said hospitals are less reliant on staffing agencies, which could indicate a decline in the vacancy rate. But retirements, competition for workers and increased demand for care continue to present challenges, he said.

CNAs have the lowest share of workers age 55 and older among the 18 professions analyzed in the report. But they also have the highest job turnover rate, with more than 35% changing jobs in 2022. Laboratory and pharmacy technicians also have high turnover rates.

The number of licensed registered nurses in Wisconsin grew 14% between 2020 and 2022, to nearly 119,000, which the WHA attributes to expanding opportunities at nursing schools and employers. The number of advanced practice nurses increased by 41%, to around 10,800.

But the rebound includes retired nurses. The annual growth of 2,666 active nurses is “far from the projected annual growth of 4,000 needed to meet demand over the next decade,” the report says.

UW Health and Meriter to build rehabilitation hospital in Fitchburg

WHA has started a So Many Options campaign to increase interest in healthcare careers. He recommends expanding training opportunities, such as a nursing apprenticeship program started last year by UW Health and Madison Area Technical College.

The report says a declining number of nursing home beds and nursing home staffing shortages are putting pressure on hospital staff because patients who are ready to be discharged to nursing homes end up staying in the nursing homes. hospitals for longer while they wait for beds.

A bill that passed the state Senate health committee last week aims to improve the discharge bottleneck by providing grants for hospital-nursing home partnerships for patients with complex needs.

The measure, which previously passed the Assembly, would create an alternative to guardianship by allowing a patient representative to consent to admission to a nursing home from a hospital.

Use your resources and make connections early so you can build a network that helps you succeed. Most people will not feel like they know the job until 8-10 months in, then at about a year, year and a half, you realize you know so much less than you thought lol. That’s normal, you know more than you think at that point, just keep doing your best and you should be fine. 

3. Find something outside of work that you enjoy. If you don’t have commitments outside of work, it’s really easy to end up doing 12 hour days on the regular. Join a sport league, pickup a new hobby, commit to a gym schedule, find something that will make you leave work, and will make sure you have social time not related to the job. You’ll probably find someone else from the company there anyway, but doing outside things is really important for folks not from Madison. 

4. Enjoy the perks of the job - I don’t do this myself, but flying into new places can be really fun, and you can chain trips before/after a week of onsite work to help lower flight costs (gone to visit friends in other states for free airfare before cause of this). 

5. This isn’t college. No one is going to be giving you do-overs on a missed assignment, there is no “they’re just kids” attitude. It may feel like that because our hiring classes are primarily recent college grads, but I guarantee 9/10 of the people that start and treat it like it’s college (but now you make a lot of money) end up leaving before the year mark. If you want to go out and party, have at it, Madison has an excellent night life (it is a party college town after all), but just know if you need to get stuff done, that’s on you to figure out how to balance it all, or at least knowing to ask for help to do it. 

Lastly - the job may not feel like it right away, but it is very rewarding. You’re typically improving healthcare and the access to it by working with organizations that serve thousands to millions of people. People in high positions will trust you cause they know you were smart enough to get hired here. Have confidence in that fact.

"If you're sick, don't come to class!/Wear a mask As I'm sure many of you are aware, a lot of people are sick right now (Influenza A, Covid, possibly norovirus still, etc). In my class today there was quite a lot of sniffling and coughing, but no one other than I and the professor was wearing a mask. If you're sick, PLEASE stay home! If you have to go out in public, use what we learned through the pandemic and wear a mask! Coughing/sneezing all over the place unmasked is just going to end up getting more people sick, and with bird flu lurking in the background, we need to do what we can to prevent another massive outbreak",reddit,general madison

Oh CFD, that's interesting, CFD is something I have done, and will be using extensively over the next year for my research. It's something I've been meaning to get more exposure in. I'm currently going through the lab websites, trying to find PI's to mail. Is there any that you might recommend I look into, any groups or PI's who have this sort of multidisciplinary approach with people from different backgrounds. No worries if you can't share! 

That's a good idea, I'll ask Sara regarding funding related questions and also if internationals need to have an advisor secured before applying. 

It's good that it worked out for you in the end though haha, but yea I agree, I'm looking all around for different universities and different advisors, have spent the last 4 months doing this. I'll aim to apply to at least 5 places. I'm just afraid that I have too many interests, like I want to do renewable energy research but I also saw really cool research on space solar at caltech and space systems and then in nuclear energy as well.

"Youll find a much easier/cheaper time getting off campus (not UW Affiliated) parking. Some city parking have monthly passes you can get. Theres also options on cragslist or facebook marketplace. Some apartments may also lease parking to non-residents. Reach out to landlords and ask if they do that. Youll have to do a bit of walking, but if you really want a car its the better/cheaper solution. 

As others have said, you very likely wont be eligible to even apply for campus lot parking. 

My first 2 years i parked about a 12 minute walk south from Union South, and I lived in Phillips and then Lowell Center. I used the bus most times to get to my car and back. It was still worth it for me because it was cheaper for me to have a car to go grocery shopping, out for fun, or go to my hometown. Badger bus tickets are $22-26 a trip, so $50 for a round trip. To refill my tank after a round trip i only spend $20, and its overal cheaper than an uber for what i use my car for. So i definitely understanding wanting to keep a car. I live at an apartment rn and have a parking lot behind my building.  Just wanted to add this since i know some people on here are very strong opposers to keeping cars. I definitely dont think its worth the hassle if you arent really using it, but if its going to make your nessesary commutes easier and save you money from ubers/busses, i stand by having a car. 

Your closest options to campus will probably be on the southeast side. State Street Garage doesnt do monthly passes, but i think the one by Fresh Market might? There are also lots of apartments that have garages/lots in the area, so you might have some luck. Some people who own houses kind of off of Univeristy may also rent out parking spots.

"As someone who was born in a deep red county, isn't it interesting how they have all the answers to everything, yet its those big ""violent"" blue cities that people actually choose to live in? 

Nearly one in every five Wisconsin residents lives in Milwaukee County. Places like Downtown and the Third Ward have more people than most entire counties in Wisconsin. Yet ask most people in those counties why so many people choose to live somewhere that's so violent and dangerous and scary and they'll look at you like you just told them you came from Mars.

This is what Scott Walker and the idiots who voted for them wanted. A pointless one-sided culture war fought by people who lacked the ambition and initiative to experiences or understand anything of the world beyond their hometown bar. So now that they don't understand how anything works, or even know anyone they didn't go to high school with, they think liberal boogeymen from the big cities are trying to control how they live.

Let's be honest about how many places in Wisconsin that could describe. Suffice to say, there's a reason I haven't been back to my town since my grandparents passed.

Because other than election season when rural voting patterns can and often do affect the rights of every citizen, those big city liberals really couldn't care less what people choose to do in rural Wisconsin. The only exception is those of us who got a taste of that life in our formative years and moved to to the city because we wanted nothing to do with it. 

I wish it didn't have to be like this. But I'm sick and damn tired of rural Wisconsin spewing hate at places like Madison, Milwaukee, Chicago, etc. and not being held accountable when they're the ones who started this idiotic culture war.",reddit,downtown
"Nope, the carbonation makes drinks markedly worse for your teeth due to the chemical reaction between CO2 and water, especially under pressure. Check the pH rating of various carbonated drinks. If you drink citrus flavored drinks it's worse. Sugar is also bad, but you can mitigate some of the damage by using artificial sweeteners since bacteria can't process it.

As for Indian food, I haven't found a dish I like yet. It's either too sloppy of a consistency (curries in particular.

"Any insight on delayed reporting? A woman in a local group (a group that claims to be about community information but often just posts MAGA political posts and the comments are full of rants from MAGAs, only posts Fox 6 articles…you know the type) posted these photos this morning with the same time stamp and was wondering why all counties were reporting the Republican numbers, while many smaller counties hadn’t posted the Democratic returns. I checked the site myself and saw the same. Does anyone have an insight as to why they would have waited to report? I’m sure there is a logical explanation for this, but the comments were full of the typical “they needed to find how many votes they’d need to make the number bigger” or “they needed to gather illegal ballots” or “they had to find a sack of ballots”. I’m just genuinely curious if anyone knows. 

Last night when the results were coming in and the amendments failed a Fox 6 article was posted and captioned “not good” and there was a bit of a meltdown in the comments section, with comments like “we’ll see what happens when we have a Republican governor! They won’t like it then!” or “They worded it so confusing and no one understood” or “if they’re Dems get in they’d do the same!” All that kind of nonsense. I hardly see any community information anymore, and I didn’t know they were so overtly political when I joined awhile ago (the group description just said we do support police, which it typical of a page that posts about local crime, so wasn’t surprising to see). I stay in to see the meltdowns now, and to see who hearts posts like the one about the amendments failing, to know that I’m not alone in that group—there are others with sense there. 

Sorry for the long post—again, just curious if anyone knows more about the county reporting. I obviously do not think there is anything nefarious behind it. And by 3 PM almost all counties had reported the Dem numbers.",reddit,general madison

"Hey there! I was in a similar situation in my first semester, couldn't get myself out of bed in the mornings, cried myself to sleep most nights, I've always had a lot of panic attacks (once or twice a month) and I actually got so anxious I *stopped* having panic attacks and instead was just stressed all the time, started avoiding public places, the whole shebang. My parents knew about it all and were understanding and supportive (had depression in high school and got therapy then, dad also has panic disorder/anxiety) - they scheduled an appointment for me with my regular doctor over winter break and I got a prescription for antianxiety/antidepressants. The difference between before antidepressants and after was literally lifechanging.

What helped me cope was skills I learned in therapy. A lot of cognitive behavioral therapy for me boiled down into: if I'm anxious about something, do I want to not be anxious about it? -&gt; if yes, then analyze the anxiety -&gt; what is making me anxious -&gt; why does it make me feel anxious -&gt; is that reason valuable and reasonable to me -&gt; if yes, then it is good anxiety and I need to stop worrying about it; if no, then there is no reason to be anxious and I need to take deep breaths to reduce the physical response now that I've addressed the mental response.

Another great coping skill is exercise - my dad once told me that aerobic exercise 4 times a week for 30 minutes each time will fix my brain. I don't actually hit that goal, usually it's like 3 times a week for 20 minutes each time, but it does help a lot because it adjusts your brain chemistry similar to an antidepressant.

If coping skills start to fail, or you can't get yourself to start using the skills, I think it's time for medication. The way I decided was, normally I'm very in control of my brain, and if I feel like I'm losing control, then I needed medication. Medication will give you back the control, it'll give you the little chemical boost you need to be able to start making those decisions to use the skills.

  
Also, as someone who's always gotten a lot of panic attacks - my biggest tip for getting through them is *don't freak out.* A panic attack definitely feels scary. That's the whole point, your brain is super scared. But the reality is you're not in any actual danger. (This gets a lot easier to understand/deal with when you're on your 50th, 60th, 70th panic attack 😂.) The best thing you can do for yourself when you're having a panic attack is move yourself into a lower-stress situation - if you're moving around or in a busy place, find a quiet corner or step outside, sit down, close your eyes for a bit. Whatver you need to do to gather yourself. You can function through a panic attack, I've done it for hours before, so even though it feels terrifying and world-ending, you can rest assured you will survive. Just do whatever you need to do to stay calm and then keep going about your business as usual. Highly recommend adding a nap into your day after a panic attack, too. They take a lot out of you.",reddit,general madison

"It really depends on what time of year you’re going, how much time you have, and what your family likes.

When our family made this drive a year or so ago with our kid is a little older than your oldest just went straight through to Niagara Falls to get the haul out of the way. 

There’s stuff in Cleveland. You pass by plenty of cities with minor league baseball teams (Toledo, Erie, Buffalo).  Buffalo seems to have a naval museum that I wish I had known about when we were there because my kid would have gotten a kick out of the big ships.

In Niagara, don’t sleep on Fort Niagara. It’s a little bit north of everything right on Lake Ontario. If you’re lucky, they’ll be doing some living history demonstrations when you’re there and you’ll get to see some cannon firing demos. It’s a very neat place away from all the hubbub of Niagara Falls. 

Also, Buzzy’s Pizza in Niagara Falls is pretty great. Kid friendly. They don’t deliver to the touristy hotels, but I had a local recommend it to me.  Was excellent. 

I wouldn’t bother with Cedar Point, OH. We stayed there on our way back. Mileage may vary, but the hotel was way overpriced and worn out - leaking ceilings, musty smells, just low-rent motel vibes and much much higher price. Parking was miserable. The little beach area on the lake was so dirty with trash and dead fish.  Maybe the coasters are so much fun that people can overlook the negatives, but I hated my experience.

A few hours later, he gets a call from the owner saying that he's been fired for leaving. I don't understand, he was told to leave? I think that there's been some miscommunication or maybe the owner isn't aware of why my friend left, but unfortunately isn't answering texts about it.

"Owner of Crawfish Junction in Johnson Creek severely beaten on Mother’s Day (post copied from Facebook) I have some really bad news to share today. Please take some time to read this post in its entirety, and please, please share.
By now some of you know what took place at Crawfish Junction just over a week ago, the evening of Mother's Day. After an absolutely awesome day with our brunch, (which was only possible by an enormous and awesome effort by our staff who are the best at what they do!), our day took a turn for the worst in the evening. After our brunch at 2pm, we closed for the day. Around 7:30pm, a group of people left another area bar and came to Crawfish Junction, entering the back parking lot. As we were closed following our brunch, one of the people in this group decided to take a leak on our food truck which was parked out back, in view of our connected apartment which was occupied by our tenant and her children. Our chef and co-owner, Nate Moralez, was still on the property and confronted this individual (first by offering to let him come inside to use our bathroom), and then he asked the group to leave when the individual became hostile. They appeared to have been drinking, and we do not fully know what their intentions were. Nate was subsequently attacked, knocked over a parking block and jumped. On the ground, he took some very serious blows and kicks from this person. Death threats were made towards Nate, and the group then left. Nate went to the Emergency room that night with multiple broken bones in his face, busted up ribs and a major concussion. He obviously has been unable to work, as well as being very sensitive to light and activity since then. He has had to return to the hospital again due to the severity of his injuries, and may still need surgery. He is currently at home resting and recovering, a process that could take 3 weeks at least. 
We are appalled, and sickened, by what happened. I have no words to describe not only how bad and unnecessary this was, how twisted, but also the severity of the injuries inflicted to Nate, who by size and nature isn't a person to pick a fight. I am hoping beyond hope that this person can be found to face the justice they deserve. I am hoping you can help by sharing this post. Some information and clarifications:

1. Yes there is an open police investigation with felony charges pending. 

2. Yes there are some leads, and leads that the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office are following with success. However the process with the county has been cloudy and slower than we would like, so we are hoping to help more by posting. 

3. We have camera footage that has already been sent to the detectives. This occurred between two vehicles in our parking lot. We are aware of at least one place the group was at prior, and the sheriffs are pursuing those leads, hoping for more camera footage from there. (We are adding a number of cameras this week to our own property too).

4. The vehicles in question were a maroon Chevy truck with a spare tire on the front passenger side, there was at least one female and one male in the truck, a sport bike driven by a woman and a motorcycle with distinct handlebars driven by a man. I have attached pictures of them entering. 

5. How can you help? Please share this post. Please contact the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office detectives division at 920-674-7316 and pass along any information that you think would help the investigation. This occurred two Sundays ago in Milford.

6. Why didn't we post sooner? I am not going to lie, this is probably the most absurd, shocking thing I have experienced in my 12 years here. Nate is in pretty rough shape, but he is on the mend. But this entire process and losing a main part of our crew has set us back, and we have been struggling to catch back up. We are down in the kitchen until then with Becca and I both helping to fill in (on top of her trying to assist Nate at home), and our amazing team is picking up as much of the work as they can. Please be patient and understanding as you visit our restaurant these next few weeks. We appreciate you all so much and hope you can understand. 

The Crawfish Junction I know and love, the one I bought into 8 years ago now, is supposed to be somewhere fun, somewhere happy, somewhere everyone can feel welcome, and this has been so against what we want here, that it has taken a little time to work through and process. But I want you to know that we appreciate each and every one of our supporters, and all you have done and continue to do for us. Your support is what drives us. Thanks for your time.

"Immigration program pause causes Green Bay couple to lose their jobs When 25-year-old Tetiana Chukhniai came to the Fox Valley two years ago with her husband and son under the Uniting for Ukraine program, she thought she had found a safe haven for her family to rebuild their life.

But now the family’s dreams have been crushed after certain immigration programs were suspended last week. Unable to get their work visas renewed, she and her husband, Ivan, lost their jobs. 

The couple face uncertainty in how they will stay afloat in a foreign country and support their 6-year-old son without employment, and whether their temporary parole status, which allows them to stay in the U.S., could be revoked.

In Ukraine, the family owned a condominium in Kyiv. Tetiana has a master’s degree in international law and represented clients in court. Ivan, who is 32, has a bachelor’s degree and owned a business as a clothing designer.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Kyiv became a focus of the conflict. The family left the country with only $200 and drove to Germany where they stayed for a year before arriving in the U.S. in 2023 under Uniting for Ukraine, an immigration initiative implemented by the previous administration that provided a lawful, streamlined way for Ukrainian citizens to temporarily stay in the U.S. for urgent humanitarian reasons. 

The program required Ukrainians to find a U.S. sponsor to provide support while in the country. Tetiana commented in a Facebook group to find a sponsor family and connected with a Wisconsin couple in their 60s. 

A few months later, the family flew to Chicago to meet their sponsors, Shirley and John Jauquet of Green Bay. They lived with the Jauquet family for about 16 months until they were able to move into a place of their own. 

Shirley Jauquet said the Chukhniai family was welcomed by the community and quickly adjusted to the new environment. 
“I mean, they're doing everything the right way, and they're the kind of people you want in America; you want them as new citizens,” she said.

Their son, Makarii, has flourished, becoming fluent in English and adjusting well to his new school.

“He's a remarkable child, and I understand that because he's got two very smart parents,” Jauquet said. “They would just be the perfect immigrants to come to America and you know, start their own business. They're just number one with us. We love them and we don't want them to leave.”

Tetiana found part time employment as a paralegal at firms in Green Bay and Appleton, and last September moved on to a full-time position at Brehmer Law in Neenah.

Ivan cared for their son and started a limited liability company for his clothing business, shipping his products worldwide, and recently began working as a delivery driver for Amazon. 

They filled a need in the workforce, with 8 million open jobs nationwide last month, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that over the next eight years, there will be an estimated 37,300 job openings for paralegals and legal assistants, and 96,300 openings for light truck delivery drivers nationally each year.

The Chukhniai family doesn’t fit the negative stereotypes portrayed by anti-immigration sentiments. They arrived in the U.S. legally, are not drug users, have no criminal record and don’t rely on government assistance. 

“We rent a home here and have always tried to contribute positively to our community,” Tetiana said. “In 2024, we successfully paid our taxes and intend to do so again this year.”

They’ve enjoyed celebrating American holidays, visiting the Green Bay Packers’ Lambeau Field and spending time at Lake Michigan in Manitowoc and Sheboygan. During a visit to the lake last summer, Ivan is credited with saving a child from drowning. 

Tetiana keeps a copy of the Sheboygan police report on hand in the event it could help sway any support in their efforts to stay in this country.

Migrants who arrive in the U.S. on humanitarian parole can apply for temporary protected status (TPS), which allows them to avoid deportation for a designated time and apply for extensions if their country is unsafe to return to. The couple applied for TPS a year ago and are awaiting approval. 

In December, Tetiana and Ivan applied for re-parole and work authorization renewals, following the proper steps and timelines, but approval was delayed. Then last week, the Department of Homeland Security issued an internal memo that has not been made public, indefinitely freezing the issuance of new immigration benefits for several programs. 

CBS News reported receiving a statement Feb. 19 from the Department of Homeland Security confirming that immigration program applications would be on hold indefinitely ""pending the completion of additional vetting to identify any fraud, public safety, or national security concerns.""

This impacted Uniting for Ukraine, the CHNV process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to remain in the country on a temporary basis, and the Family Reunification Process for nationals from Colombia, Ecuador, Haiti and Cuba, enabling them to stay in the U.S. while awaiting family-sponsored green cards.
With immigration programs paused, Tetiana and Ivan’s work authorizations expired last week and their employers were required to terminate them. 

Matt Brehmer of Brehmer Law said he would “absolutely” rehire Tetiana if she were able to obtain a valid work permit.
""The integrity that she has in doing right by herself and her family is very admirable,” he said. “Although she has been through an unimaginable experience, she fights every day to show up for her family and does what she can to provide the best life for them.”

Jennie Murray, president and chief executive of the National Immigration Forum, said the immigration program freeze that went into effect last week will remove 3 million authorized workers from the workforce. 

“To take any authorized worker from the system hurts American businesses and hurts individual Americans, because it will only impact our supply-chain issues and our inflation,” Murray said.

She pointed to polling that indicates voters want the administration to only prioritize removing violent criminals and not individuals who are contributing to society, “and they certainly don't want to see families separated,” she said.

The Chukhniai and Jauquet families have contacted their local representatives and congressmen about the matter. 

“I'm embarrassed that our government puts them through these hoops because they are such good people,” Jauquet said.
The situation has taken a heavy emotional and financial toll on the Chukhniai family, who are now facing the prospect of having to move back in with their sponsor family or potentially leave the U.S. altogether.

“I don't know if I would have enough patience to keep going here and trying to survive, or in the end, we have to, again, pack all of our life into three suitcases and leave; we don't know,” Tetiana said.

Without the ability to work, the family won’t be able to afford basic necessities like food, let alone rent and other bills. 

“We need to tell people what’s going on and it’s worse than you can imagine,” she said. “It’s not happening on television somewhere, it’s right here, and it’s closer than they can even imagine.”

But she doesn’t place blame on the current administration. As a non-citizen who can't vote, Tetiana said it would be wrong to choose a side. With the country so divisive, she instead asked for unity. 

“If we could let people know what’s going on and even one person would change their mind, or would think more about that, or would pray, that’s worth it,” she said.

The family’s situation is not unique. Immigration attorney Molly Smiltneek of Oshkosh said she’s heard from other Ukrainians living in Wisconsin who entered the U.S. legally under the previous administration and are now facing similar challenges.

“Looking at it from their perspective, they're trying to figure out ways that they could stay and continue rebuilding their lives in the United States, or return to war in Ukraine, or a war-torn country that, you know, their homes may or may not exist anymore, that might not be safe for them in any way,” she said.

President Trump signed an executive order in January targeting immigration programs, promising to “terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States,” implemented under the Biden administration. 

Smiltneek said if that happens, humanitarian parolees like the Chukhniai family would be considered “out of status” and could be targeted for deportation and removal from the U.S. under an expedited process. 

Currently, the only pathway for migrants who came to the U.S. temporarily under the programs to obtain a green card and be granted permanent residency is to apply for asylum, a process that is also being significantly restricted under the new executive orders, making it inaccessible for many. 

“I think the administration at the time assumed that Congress would take action for both Ukrainians and Afghans to give them a path to stay once they were here, to support our allies, and that never happened,” Smiltneek said.

She added that the people who came to the U.S. under the programs, and the host families who supported them, feel betrayed.

“We made promises to them, and we said that you would be safe here, and we aren't keeping those promises, and I think it is a terrible example of our broken immigration system,” Smiltneek said. “I'm saddened that so many people who thought they at least had some security are now incredibly and rightfully fearful of deportation and removal, and that doesn't serve us, or serve our country, or serve humanity well.”

She warned that the country is entering a dark time for immigration and asked that people provide direct support to immigrants, donate to or volunteer for organizations who work with immigrants, and advocate and stand up for them.

“Those of us who have the privilege to, need to hold our elected representatives responsible, and tell them what this means to you and why it's important that we treat human beings with dignity and respect,” Smiltneek said.

Up until they lost their jobs last week, Tetiana and Ivan were making plans to purchase a house. That – like many things – is now on hold. 

Tetiana had always heard the U.S. was founded on principles of independence, justice and fairness, and would like her family to have a chance at the American dream.

“I used to represent clients’ rights in the court in front of the justice,” she said, “and now I try to find this justice here.”

"when i had a roommate like this i got so angry i told her i no longer want to live with her and that she was messing up the dynamic and she had to leave. she obviously refused so for the rest of the year i just sucked it up and avoided her at all costs. 

it’s really terrible to have to feel so angry and tense when you’re at home but at the end of the day you can’t really control them. it sounds like you have confronted him and told him exactly what he’s doing that is making you upset and he didn’t give a fuck. 

if you can find an incentive to get him to move out i’d suggest doing that and just tell him straight up “living with you is a nightmare”

otherwise you can only control yourself. try to make your room your safe place and do self care. this will all be over in 10 months and you will be able to tell the story of your horrific roommate just like me.",reddit,general madison
"I worked for the university for years as staff and am now a student here, so I think I have more perspective on this than most members of this sub. I also worked at other universities prior to coming here, and I think the problems I saw are pretty common across higher education.

**TL;DR:** This is probably a good thing, in the long term, because it will force people interested in making the school a more inclusive place to be creative and to try things with real measurable impact. In principle, it is also a good thing for the school, as a wing of the state government, to treat all citizens the same, regardless of their race, sex, etc.. Further, it does no good to alarm people by saying that campus is ""explicitly unsafe for LGBTQ+ and BIPOC folks.""

**The long version:** I spent years working for the school, and over the course of my employment, I sat through probably dozens of hours of DEI-related content. This was found both in DEI-specific workshops (Lunch and Learns, Inclusive Leadership trainings, etc.), and in the regular mandatory trainings I had to take for things like FERPA, sexual assault reporting requirements, etc.. In general, all of this DEI content had two things in common: first, the level of academic or professional rigor was consistently low; and second, the content was frequently explicitly ideological. 

When I say that the level of academic rigor was low, I am referring to the fact that training leaders and presenters were not ""expert"" in any way that met basic levels of professionalism. They would say things like, ""McKinsey did a study that showed that inclusive companies were more than 20% more profitable."" But if you asked the presenter how the study categorized companies as ""inclusive"" or ""not inclusive,"" or what specific actions the companies took that made the biggest impact, the speakers wouldn't know, because they had not themselves read the study. (This particular study was cited in at least four presentations that I can think of off top of head, and actually made no effort to determine causality, so it could just as easily have proved that very profitable companies implement DEI measures because they have the spare cash to do so.) Consistently, the people preparing this content for us were just *bad*, and unprofessional, and yet, would get hired again and again to do the same lazy half-assed presentations.

As for ideology, the DEI content I was fed was uniformly from a very specific ideological perspective. You can [call this ideology whatever you want](https://web.archive.org/web/20211108155321/https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/please-just-fucking-tell-me-what)\--""wokeness,"" progressive identitarianism, the identity synthesis--but, like Justice  Stewart and pornography, I know it when I see it. Much of the content simply assumed that it is unjust to treat people the same, regardless of their skin color, but I, and I think most other Americans, disagree! I think it is a laudable goal to try and treat others the same, regardless of their immutable demographic characteristics; people will fail to do this, but when we fail, we should correct ourselves and try again, but that does not mean the goal is a bad one. If a government-run educational institution is forcing students and staff to learn ideological content, then the ideological nature of that content should be subject to democratic influence and oversight, not snuck in the back door by ideologues from unaccountable offices. I think most parents would approve of their kids being taught that voting is good and democracy is a good way of picking leaders (which is an ideological position); I do not think that most Americans would approve of their kids being taught that the only remedy to past discrimination is current discrimination.

In addition to the generally poor quality and lax standards for DEI content, it was also tainted by who was *not* included. The posture and behavior of DEI offices across campus make it fairly clear that their bailiwick is the retention of *under-represented minority* (i.e. primarily Black, secondarily Hispanic, and maybe the two dozen Native) students, and nobody else. East or South Asian students, Jews, and other ""over-represented minorities"" were (and *are*) routinely ignored by the DEI teams. The Multicultural Center runs a Middle Eastern Heritage Month with no reference to Jews or Israel at all, and nobody on staff seems to think this is a problem. Can you *imagine* if the History department did an American Heritage Month and did not even mention Black Americans? The hypocrisy is obvious to everyone.

I also want to address your comment about how campus is now ""unsafe"" for LGBTQ+ and BIPOC people. I am gay, and it is hard to tell what is more absurd: that campus is not currently safe for LGBTQ people, or that the Gender and Sexuality Campus Center is some kind of anti-hate beacon preventing anyone outside the center from hating gay people. My experience with the GSCC as a staff member was that Warren and per gaggle of Mean Enbies were rude, cliquish, and self-important. I very much doubt the majority of students are even aware of the GSCC's existence; the idea that it makes any meaningful effect on non-LGBTQ students is laughable.

Finally, my biggest complaint is that DEI positions are *unaccountable*. There are no KPIs by which their performance is measured. They *literally cannot fail their jobs*. When I worked for the school, if I took no appointments and the objective measure by which I was being judged dropped below some threshold, *I would be fired*. But at the business school, we have a DEI office with at least 3 full-time employees whose entire workload is, as far as I can tell, organizing 1-2 events a semester. And if anyone says, ""hey, uh, why aren't you actually doing anything,"" they accuse you of being a white supremacist or something.

I think it's important to add that this university is an arm of the state government of Wisconsin. Citizens in a multi-ethnic, multiracial society be treated equally by our shared government. Once we start doling out resources (whether that is access to enrollment-limited programs, physical space on campus, scholarship money, etc.) on the basis of people's immutable demographic characteristics, then we are no better than Yugoslavia or other countries riven apart by ethnic strife.",reddit,campus

"1. Bus and Engr programs get you for more $$$ at many schools as they have higher expected salaries when students are outcoming.
2. No need for car as a frosh. Many get by without one for entire time there - some combo of bus, walking, bike, uber. Some get one later on, especially if living further off campus or have jobs/internships further away. But parking on campus generally is terrible (scarce and expensive).
3. Suggest dorms first year - everything walkable, easy food/laundry, meet tons of people, get the lay of the land. Then let your child steer, whether staying in dorms another year, going off-campus, sorority life, etc. She’ll figure out what she wants after acclimating to the city. Some off-campus places are spendy, others not so much (typically further from campus and/or older)

"well… starting off, there is absolutely no guarantee that you will get the dorm you want. none at all. my first year i ranked the dorm i ended up getting near the bottom of my choices—it was ONLY on my list because i wanted to be in the learning community and i didn’t even get put on the LC’s floor. 

i’d say in general try to avoid cole, sullivan, bradley, and phillips (UNLESS you want to be involved in a learning community in any of those dorms and are fine taking a chance with not being placed into it) just because they’re un-renovated and have that brutalist, prison-like aura inside and out that is pretty miserable. if you’re prone to depressive episodes i wouldn’t recommend living there. plus they have no air conditioning, but that only matters in september usually. that being said, they are some of the cheapest dorms to live in, very close to the lakeshore dining halls, and, like all lakeshore dorms, in relatively close proximity to most of the STEM buildings (but farther from the buildings were humanities and gen eds are typically held). other cheap dorms are the ones that are even older (jorns, kronsage, merit, barnard, etc.), they aren’t renovated but they are at least somewhat charming/cozy. 

basically any of the newer dorms (dejope, smith, ogg, leopold) or recently renovated ones (witte/sellery) will give you a similar experience and are generally very comparable/nice to live in. and as others have said, chadbourne is very central, very large, and very community-centered. it’s un-renovated, but has a lot of pros to living there (one being that it is directly connected to one of the dining halls). 

this is all my opinion as someone who has lived in both cole and ogg, so i have had both the southeast and lakeshore dorm experience. i am also a STEM major, so to me southeast is great for freshmen, horrible
if you are majoring in pretty much any of the biological sciences or engineering (unless you enjoy walking). lakeshore is prettier and much quieter, but far from the classes you’ll be taking as a freshman. all that said, take my opinion with a grain of salt. there are 20 dorms here and each one has pros and cons.",reddit,general madison
"I taught at JMU and currently teach at UW. These are very different schools in very different places, but both have their strengths. 

UW is a well known engineering school with a long track record of graduate success. This will help in terms of getting the foot in the door in terms of interviews. UW has a relatively well built system of support for students, but the size of the school and program mean you will have to go out of your way to be noticed by your instructors early on (and your early instructors may be staff or grad students, not research faculty). The metro area is about half a million people and growing rapidly, and the university is right in the middle of downtown, which leads to issues in terms of housing availability and affordability, but also means that it is in a very energetic and vibrant part of the city.

JMU is a growing school and the engineering program is less well known, but the size has advantages in terms of standing out in your introductory classes. There were no “pit” freshmen classes a few years ago (almost all classes are 40 people or smaller), so you can get to know your professors right away. Harrisonburg is about 55,000 and housing has not been a significant problem. The city has some nice amenities for it size, but it is a much smaller city. It is in the heart of the Shenandoah valley, so if you hike to relax, that is  point in its favor.

My rough recommendation is: if you are a well skilled student with a specialization in mind, UW is a great choice; if you are interested in a relaxed place that is more likely to have opportunities to work with faculty early on, JMU is a great choice. In the end, the best choice is the one where you put in the work after you’ve made the choice.",reddit,downtown
"I am not good at the whole ""quote"" people on here. Just an old guy with a vested interest in UW Madison. I placed your comments below preceded by *** with my response below. 


***The Israeli government has achieved this as portraying Palestinians as violent, antisemetic terrorist sympathizers

Palestinians are the ones chanting for the end of Isreal. By that action alone, that makes them anti-semetic. 


***describing their legitimate acts of resistance (before october 7th as attacks, not for the liberation of their peoples, but as an act against jews. 

You lose me here - shooting rockets into cities is not legitimate acts of resistance. They are acts of war and should be resolved to on kind and with overwhelming force. 


***But this is because a Zionist state is perpetrating violence against their peoples in the name of judaism. 

They perpetrate violence in response to Palestinian acts of war. See above. 


***Under persecution, you can see that Gazans have been in a prison for many years, with no ability to leave Gaza, no access to water salianation plants (meaning their water is toxic), no access to enough food, not enough jobs, poverty. 

The amount of aid that has been given to the Palestinian people over the years that has been wasted by the leaders of Hamas is a crime in itself. The people have fiddled away time and resources while the aid was used to fortify Gaza. 


***The resistance attack on october 7th, which was unprecedented and unnacceptable in terms of the civilian casualties, and should be called out as terrrorism

It was not a resistance attack when you murder babies in cold blood, decapitate elderly women and video the attack on civilians. Not military camps, but neighborhoods. Not bases, but concerts. That's not resistance, that's terrorism that can not be redeemed by saying ""no Mas"" once the Israeli military bombs you into the 3rd century. 


***And students have the right to protest and call for their university stop funding a country which is committing these acts.

Yes, students do have this right. As I (and others) have a right to think it's completely BS that universities allow it to happen. I hope all universities take the same action that Columbia took today in suspending these people.

"You know this bill was to provide more people with jobs right? Yeah we have a underpaid workers issue, but we also just have a plain old worker shortage also.  So much crap intertwined.  For example 54% of the nation illiterate.  Madison Memorial High has 30% not attending school regularly. How did those things happen?? Frankly it likely led to last election voting.  So suggesting these kids should be studying, having fun, maybe they should be allowed a job and a sense of work ethic, maybe even a place of normalcy, or a feeling of belonging somewhere. Until 11p does seem nutty mostly because they need to get home, either by bus, a parent, or walking.  There probably is a reason this is all happening.  Shitty parenting, imagine being at school to learn but you're illiterate and in high school. Perhaps families are struggling so they have a child working either providing daycare, or actually working.  I know my youngest sister worked to put food on the table, because her only other parent was doing his best but fell short at times.  He refused to use any programs.  My sister went on to being valedictorian, has a Master's degree, and teaches at a college. She found time to be very active in school, have a job, and cook dinner.  For me at least it gives a family some options.  I know I trailed away a bit but that's because this is just not a yes or no issue.  There's just so much more to it.

"Before I start my actual thoughts I will say, any comparison that involves Obama’s win in 2008 is not valid. That was such a unique election that is not happening again for a long long time. 

I don’t disagree with your premise as a larger aspirational goal. But on a practical sense for statewide races we don’t NEED to win the Driftless area (outside La Crosse Co.) but we do need to lose it well. The reason I say this is there is a delicate balance that needs to be done for democrats in Wisconsin between the interests of four large groups, Dane Co. Milwaukee Co, The Fox Valley, and the rest of the state. 

One of the things Ben Wickler did so well was focus campaigns on that balance. If we win Dane and Milwaukee Counties like we should and have in most races, we don’t NEED to win the Fox Valley or upstate, but we do have to lose it well. 

The issue is when you try to win upstate as a Democrat you start to alienate those groups in Dane and Milwaukee counties. We did a ton of that through the Mike Tate and especially the Maratha Lanning eras of the party. And you saw leftists independent candidates running in core Madison assembly and senate seats, turnout in Madison was down, Milwaukee elected Scott Walker as the county executive and David Clarke as sheriff. 

All of those things would be unthinkable now, why, because Madison and Milwaukee are the core of democrats message. 

But what does that mean for the rest of the state. It means we need to accept that we are not winning 72 counties. We need to look at how do we help win races. I grew up both in real life and politics in Clark County, Republican as they come, one of the birthplaces of the Posse Comitatis movement that would morph into Soverign Citizens. Taking out 2008, Clark Co had not voted even 45% democratic in my lifetime. But when we did well statewide we got 40% not 33-35%. 

Now on the local level I think there are winnable seats down there in the assembly and senate. But it will take finding the right candidate who can build a winning coalition, which might have to include appealing to moderate voters *gasp*.",reddit,general madison

"Stop using cis. Stop assuming other's gender identity when simply refering to the average populace of a certain sex. 

The *rate of development* is reduced. It's not an immediate shut off valve. You nitpicking over the ignorance of a reduction being needed to acheive a stop is ridiculous.

My point was to highlight that ""high"", is stopped, until ""normal"" is acheive. That ""safe"" is acheiving the norm. That they are specifically intervening to prevent ""abnormal levels"", deeming such unhealthy.

But transgender children seek to achieve these ""unhealthy levels"". You can't simply say ""it's SAFE"", when we are discussing different use cases. Especially when they flat out contradict one another. 

Sure, it can certainly be proper care for transgender children. But if that's the case, we need to STOP assuming the alternative is the proper care for everyone else. If the flexibility exists that ""abnormal"" can be perfectly fine, then it needs to stop being common medical practice to force children into the norm.

&gt; Also, it's very clear you're trying to (badly) troll

I'm not. It's annoying people think this way just because they are being called out for so blatantly misgendering others because it helps frame the entire structure of the ideology. But it violates the very principle of gender identity itself as a personal choice. Literally just adhere to the concept and stop imposing your interpretation of gender identity on others. You literally award that grace to everyone who deems themself trans or is questioning, yet demand anyone who objects to it as being ""blind"" to their own gender identity. It's just so tiresome.

&gt; but cis simply stated that one identifies with one's gender assigned at birth, which the vast majority of the population do.

How are you claiming that? Based on what decrees from others are you establishing their gender identity? A male simply going by man/he may simply have ACCEPTED a societal label that conveys their SEX, without consideration to a distinct concept of gender. A cisgender identity requires the same as a transgender identity. Concluding a gender identity, and then simply relating that to one's assigned gender at birth. 

Having an identity to sex can be a distinct thing from having an identity to gender. Stop forcing it on people as if a requirement. Literally this is a huge part of the disconnect. Transgender people wish to be identified by their gender as opposed to their sex. While many others wish to have a social identity structure based on sex, as it's what their own sense of identity is based upon. Thus the conflict.

When ""science"" declares that children form their gender identity at the age of three they are simply refering to the the ability to form SCHEMAS has begun. And schemas can be attributed to anything. ""I have a penis, I'm a boy"" is not a cisgender identity. It wasn't a function of acheiving a distinct concept of gender that one could identify toward. Because if that existed for everyone, NO ONE would be trans. 

So in recognizing transgender people exist, that ""gender"" is a DISTINCT concept from sex to observe and identify to, that same allowance needs to be granted to everyone. You can't simply claim that other's use of gender pronouns conveys their gender identity. Because you don't  know what the basis of that language was to them, what the schema was based upon.

""Identify as the gender assigned at birth"" is a MADE UP CONCEPT. It doesn't mean anything objectively, but perceived by people to mean something. I don't believe I was assigned a gender at birth. I believe people observed my sex and set gender stereotypes and labels upon that sex. There's nothing for my personal identity to ""align"" with. I just recognize that. I can be gender nonconforming without it influencing this sense of identity.

Personally, I've considered a preference to be the opposite sex. To ""pass"" as a girl amongst other girls. But I can recognize I'm male. And that for most of society, ""man"", conveys I'm male. So even if a desperately wanted to be female, I'd  be male, and thus a man. I find it offensive that the idea that a ""man"" would be something one would personally identify to. I would need to make assumptions and stereotypes of what that ""means"" rather than just being male. To deem what this group consisted of to claim myself amongst them. That all seems deeply illogical and morally offensive to me.

The DSM-5 criterion for gender dysphoria itself is full of gender stereotypes, contradictory usage of sex/gender, and biased personal opinions of what the opposite gender ""feels"" and ""desires"". It allows you to make such stereotypes and biases to form your own association. It's  such a gross use of deeming someone viable for such sexual transition.

This isn't me ""trolling"". If you can't discern such a critique  from ""trolling"", you aren't opening up to ever allow a disagreeing opinion.",reddit,general madison
"&gt; If you have an alternative term, use it

Refer the group by their sex. Or if you must, non-trans. I'm simply asking not to misgender people.

&gt; because science has established most people identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. 

No it hasn't. Gender identity is a personal claim. It can't be perceived in another. 

&gt; Again, normal based on what? 

You used the term yourself. Scientific observation observes the norms of members of the sex, while acknowledging variance levels, only intervening when such is at ""extreme"" enough levels to offer the concerns that the medical field has identifies as issues.

&gt; Blocking puberty until that age falls perfectly into the realm of normal 

So would it be best for all children to be placed on puberty blockers? Let them ALL make that decision? I'm  honestly asking. Is there a reason to oppose that?

&gt; just because it hurts your feelings and scares you doesn't make it abnormal. Normal does not always equal to ""average,"" and averages change. 

You've used the term normal interchangeably as well. We know what we are referencing. You're the only one that seems to want to place a negative connotation on abnormal.

&gt; The ""cure"" for most people regarding what?

Them seeking medical intervention. To cure an ailment. Stop trying to read offensive in basic statements. 

&gt; I have ""high"" testosterone levels despite having every other female sex characteristic  — no one's offered me any treatment and I'm getting by just fine with that.

Okay. To an extreme level? It's been mentioned to you, so in what context? ...But you don't need to divulge. I don't  really see how this addresses any part of this discussion. I'm not arguing that people need to seek something.

&gt; They're old enough to get the concept of ""gender"" and ""sex,"" even if you don't.

Please define gender for me as a condition of identity. What makes man distinct from woman. Please don't use regressive stereotypes, that reduces feminine to the gender of ""woman"". Keep in mind that gender presentation is distinct from gender identity. That many transgender people don't  wish to physically transition.

&gt; Also, because sex and gender are closely intertwined for most of the population.

Gender as in feminine and masculine are intertwined with sex as such literally defined the norms of the sexes. But again, being feminine doesn't make you a woman. People don't identify as woman because they are feminine, they largely simply ACCEPT that are men/women based on sex and then DEAL with gender norms pressures that they can choose to agree with or challenge. They largely DEAL with bodies that they can just accept or not in various ways that aren't even based on sex. 

&gt; Why are you comparing a surgery to a reversible medical intervention? 

Surgery can be reversible, especially when it's an addition rather than a removal. Also, blockers STUNT maximum growth. Prolonging puberty alters the trajectory. It's not some reservoir that will maintain the same effect as if the interruption wasn't made. Aspect of the rest of the body continue and they will interact differently once it's  ""running again"" than it would have without the pause.",reddit,general madison

~ Food ~
Madison has a ton of amazing coffee/breakfast spots which you could do solo, my favorites are Black Locust, Indie Coffee, and Lazy Jane’s. 

For dinner, I’d highly recommend Nattspil, Bar Corallini, and Settle Down Tavern. 

~ Daytime Sights ~
I second the terrace at Memorial Union and capitol square (Saturday farmer’s market, if possible). I also loved walking or biking (you can rent e-bikes throughout the city) near the lakes — there are amazing paved trails and my favorite route was from the Brittingham Beach area past the Monona Terrace to the Williamson Street area and then cut back downtown through the capitol square.

~ Nightlife ~
Madison has a great selection of cocktail bars if you’re into that. I really like the Robin Room, Eno Vino (SO to their espresso martini &amp; beautiful capitol views), and Mint Mark. 

Honorable mention to Paul’s Club, which doesn’t have as good of drinks, but is closer to the State street area and has a cool ambiance with a tree inside. 

Madison also has a nice comedy club with fun drink options!

For more casual bars, my friend group liked going dancing on the top floor of Chaser’s (DJ) or to Red Rock Saloon (sometimes they have live country music). 

After bars, I love going to Paul’s Pelmeni — they have Russian dumplings (get “The Works” = all toppings) and are open until ~2am on the weekends.

"Wisconsin social studies teachers face restrictions, complaints for teaching elections [https://www.wpr.org/news/wisconsin-social-studies-teachers-restrictions-complaints-teaching-elections](https://www.wpr.org/news/wisconsin-social-studies-teachers-restrictions-complaints-teaching-elections)

*Survey from group of social studies teachers found 42 percent report facing restrictions by administration, parents*

  
Social studies teachers are returning to the classroom during the home stretch of a contentious election season in Wisconsin. On top of their back-to-school responsibilities, they’re navigating how to teach about the topic in a politically polarized state. 

Sarah Kopplin is a social studies teacher at Shorewood Intermediate School and president of the [Wisconsin Council for the Social Studies](https://www.wcsswi.org/). She said an alarming number of social studies teachers around the state have seen pushback on their lessons about elections and other current events. 

A survey from the council found 42 percent of council member respondents reported that building administration, school boards or community members lodged complaints or put restrictions on lessons related to politics, an election or current events, Kopplin said on WPR’s “[Wisconsin Today](https://www.wpr.org/shows/wisconsin-today-2).”  

  
Sherri Michalowski taught social studies in Wisconsin for 40 years. She said the political pressures facing her profession have gotten more intense in recent years. She cited that problem as one of her reasons for retiring back in 2022.

“I just didn’t think I could play that game of having to be too careful all the time,” she said.

Kopplin has heard from other teachers like Michalowski who have left their jobs after being discouraged from teaching elections and current events by administrators and community members.

“They feel that they don’t really have a purpose for being there, and they can’t really help their students be the engaged future citizens that they want to be,” Kopplin said.

  
While [most states](https://civxnow.org/our-work/state-policy/) require high schoolers to take a civics or government course to graduate, Wisconsin does not. Districts may decide for themselves if such classes are requirements, electives or offered at all. 

Whether information on elections and current events comes from a dedicated civics course or another type of social studies class, University of Wisconsin-Madison education researcher Jeremy Stoddard said covering those topics is vital to creating informed, engaged citizens. It can also reduce political polarization.

“Schools might be the only place where they actually get exposed to different views on key issues of the day,” Stoddard told “Wisconsin Today.” “Otherwise, people get their news filtered in through one way … If they’re not doing it in schools, that’s a real problem.”

  
Stoddard’s research on how educators taught the [2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220272.2021.1992674) and [2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23328584241234884) elections suggests that teachers who were able to offer what they consider a high-quality civics education — for example, analyzing media and actively engaging with current events in class — had autonomy over their curriculum and strong support from school administrators.

He said school leadership should trust their teachers to maintain professionalism and neutrality while discussing controversial topics in the classroom.

“This is the mission of schools,” he said. “We can do this well, and we have professional teachers, so there’s no need to avoid it.”

To help K-12 teachers and administrators prepare for classroom discussions about the election, Stoddard and his colleagues at the UW-Madison School of Education will be holding a [Teaching About the Elections](https://place.education.wisc.edu/k12-programs/teaching-about-the-elections/) conference later this month.

  
Last week, the Wisconsin Council for the Social Studies released a [position statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/121pILsFQHkhB5FmpKricBJphi79Oc_GcYNS8TbOgLwU/edit) on academic freedom for Wisconsin teachers.

“The Wisconsin Council for the Social Studies firmly advocates that the teaching of civics, current events, and elections is fundamental to equipping students with the knowledge and skills required for active, informed citizenship in our democracy,” the statement reads. “Academic freedom is essential for social studies educators to facilitate these crucial lessons.”

Kopplin said teachers with academic freedom can empower their students to make informed decisions. Academic freedom is not about teachers imposing their own political beliefs on students, she added. 

“It’s actually giving students an opportunity to think to themselves: ‘What can I do with this information?’” Kopplin said. “How do they know how to analyze information so that they can inform themselves as a voter?”

  
Kopplin said she feels supported by her school administrators and community members in the way she chooses to teach her civics classes. With that support, she has been able to engage her middle schoolers in civic debates on the topics that interest them, including abortion and LGBTQ+ issues.

Kopplin said she’s inspired by how her students are able to discuss potentially controversial topics with their classmates.

“It is unbelievable to see how open-minded they are,” Kopplin said. “(They are) accepting and willing to practice being wrong, to practice listening to other people, to practice being OK with not necessarily having to agree, but still walk out of the classroom and be able to sit together at lunch or play at recess.”",reddit,campus
"My recent message to Rep. Mark Pocan and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, re: combating inflation via increased consumer empowerment.  Just recently sent this message to both Rep. Mark Pocan and Sen. Tammy Baldwin as I hear more about politician's ideas to combat inflation and price gouging. Just thought I'd share with the sub, as I've given much thought to these ideas over the past few weeks and would be interested in hearing feedback from fellow consumers in Wisconsin. 

**Dear Rep. Pocan/Sen. Baldwin,** 

**Like other Americans, my family and have felt the deep impact of inflation over the past few years, and it has dramatically changed our household budget and our room to exist in the middle class. Groceries and household supplies are primary factors in the inflationary pressure we face each month, and over time now it is very apparent that much of these rising prices are driven by corporate greed. It is evident in the record profit margins and increased CEO pay reported consistently with each quarterly update.** 

**It has taken some time, but it is appreciated that more politicians are noting this core piece of the issue, including VP Kamala Harris in her recent campaign policy proposal regarding price gouging regulation. Personally, I am very open to the consideration of such measures, but I can understand the hesitation over direct price restrictions to combat gouging, especially futher effects it could have on the supply chain.**

**But I also think much can be done to better empower consumers to see for themselves when true gouging occurs via required enhanced transparency from large, public companies to more thoroughly provide ""relative value framing"" - that is, giving customers a deeper and more expansive picture at the point of sale about how the products and services they are considering for purchase have changed in price; how that price may compare to competitors; how a company's pricing pratices overall are affecting bottom line greed.**

**To achieve this transparency, I see three regulatory measures that should be enacted:**

**1) Price histories included with online product listings and physical point-of-sale labeling.**

**I'm sure most consumers would agree that keeping tabs on incessant price increases with all the products and services they shop for is a practically impossible task. We should charge the price setters with keeping that record and making it easily accessible. A 6-month, 12-month and 24-month MSRP history would be useful in this current market, and I'm sure there are arguments to be made for other snapshots to be available.** 

**2) National standardization of price-per-unit measurements on like items across all retailers.**

**Just this past week, when I was shopping for toilet paper online, Walmart had their products labeled by cost/100 sheets and Costco labeled by cost/square foot. Furthermore, when a retailer issue had my package delayed and I went to my local Walmart store for a quick purchase, many of the unit cost labels on shelves were completely miscalculated. What should be a very helpful tool quickly becomes disorienting and frustrating by not being implemented with uniformity. My understanding is that pricing rules vary widely by state and only some have unit pricing laws or regulations. Furthermore, it seems there is great leeway for retailers to list prices in units as they see fit. These very useful unit cost breakdowns should be required and standardized for all retailers across the U.S.** 

**3) Retail-level listings of financial data.**

**I do what I can to stay on top of economic news, but I don't think it's a stretch at all to believe the average consumer doesn't have the time or even the practical access to find this information and put it to use. We should bring corporate financial updates - earnings, revenues and share prices - to the retail level via mandatory postings of this information on all sales-oriented web pages and on physical storefronts.**

**The American economy is founded on the idea of competition, but a competitive market really only exists if the buyer can make sense of what is being offered. As someone who often goes out of my way to do comparative shopping, I believe these actions would do much to give the consumer the ability to see corporate greed and decide for themselves if they will appease or reject it. I hope you will give consideration to my thoughts, and I thank you for your service to the people of Wisconsin.**",reddit,general madison
"Take the dog.

Use the vet records as indication of the health she was in when brought to the vet and ask an officer to use that information and anything else to file charges against him for neglect and abuse.

And:

What you should do if you suspect a case of Animal Cruelty or Neglect?

Animal cruelty encompasses a range of behaviors harmful to animals, from neglect to malicious killing. Most cruelty investigated by Humane Officers is unintentional neglect that can be resolved through education. Intentional cruelty, or abuse, is knowingly depriving an animal of food, water, shelter, or veterinary care or maliciously torturing, maiming, mutilating, or killing an animal.

Animal “hoarding” happens when someone has collected so many animals that they are unable to provide proper care for them.

STEP 1. Evaluate the Situation
Many people have different standards of care for their pets. While someone may not love and care for their pet as you do, it may not be an abuse situation.

Animal Neglect
Wisconsin law states that animals must have food, water, veterinary care and adequate shelter provided to them. Failure to provide a sufficient amount of food and water on a daily basis is considered neglect. Appropriate veterinary care means medical issues are addressed. Shelter must be suitable in size, and protect from inclement weather.

Animal Abuse
Wisconsin law 951.02 Mistreating animals. No person may treat any animal, whether belonging to the person or another, in a cruel manner.

“Cruel” is defined as unnecessary and excessive pain or suffering, or unjustifiable injury or death.

If you are unsure if a situation is abuse or neglect, it is always best to report it to authorities.

STEP 2. Report It
If you witness either animal neglect or abuse, you should immediately report it to your local law enforcement agency or County Humane Officer. If you are worried about retaliation against you, tell the Officer that you wish to remain anonymous. However, in some situations, remaining anonymous can make it more difficult to prosecute the case.
Include details to help the investigation. The specific address and description of the animal; license plates, address and description of the home and suspected person; and nature of abuse or neglect.

Report Details: Report as much information as you can!

1. Owners address – with directions to the home.
2. Name of owner – if known.
3. Description of animal(s) – breed, color, age, size, and any other information that will help to identify the animal.
4. Number of animals – not only those that suffer from neglect or cruelty, but include all that live in the household.
5. What type of cruelty/neglect was observed – no food, water, or shelter; or was there some incident or sign of injury witnessed?
6. Indicate if it is an emergency.
7. Please be sure to leave your name and phone number in case we need to call to ask for further information.
8. A Humane Officer will investigate your report. If it is a true emergency, call 911.",reddit,general madison

"Immigration program pause causes Green Bay couple from Ukraine to lose their jobs When 25-year-old Tetiana Chukhniai came to the Fox Valley two years ago with her husband and son under the Uniting for Ukraine program, she thought she had found a safe haven for her family to rebuild their life.

But now the family’s dreams have been crushed after certain immigration programs were suspended last week. Unable to get their work visas renewed, she and her husband, Ivan, lost their jobs. 

The couple face uncertainty in how they will stay afloat in a foreign country and support their 6-year-old son without employment, and whether their temporary parole status, which allows them to stay in the U.S., could be revoked.

In Ukraine, the family owned a condominium in Kyiv. Tetiana has a master’s degree in international law and represented clients in court. Ivan, who is 32, has a bachelor’s degree and owned a business as a clothing designer.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Kyiv became a focus of the conflict. The family left the country with only $200 and drove to Germany where they stayed for a year before arriving in the U.S. in 2023 under Uniting for Ukraine, an immigration initiative implemented by the previous administration that provided a lawful, streamlined way for Ukrainian citizens to temporarily stay in the U.S. for urgent humanitarian reasons. 

The program required Ukrainians to find a U.S. sponsor to provide support while in the country. Tetiana commented in a Facebook group to find a sponsor family and connected with a Wisconsin couple in their 60s. 

A few months later, the family flew to Chicago to meet their sponsors, Shirley and John Jauquet of Green Bay. They lived with the Jauquet family for about 16 months until they were able to move into a place of their own. 

Shirley Jauquet said the Chukhniai family was welcomed by the community and quickly adjusted to the new environment. 

“I mean, they're doing everything the right way, and they're the kind of people you want in America; you want them as new citizens,” she said.

Their son, Makarii, has flourished, becoming fluent in English and adjusting well to his new school.

“He's a remarkable child, and I understand that because he's got two very smart parents,” Jauquet said. “They would just be the perfect immigrants to come to America and you know, start their own business. They're just number one with us. We love them and we don't want them to leave.”

Tetiana found part time employment as a paralegal at firms in Green Bay and Appleton, and last September moved on to a full-time position at Brehmer Law in Neenah.

Ivan cared for their son and started a limited liability company for his clothing business, shipping his products worldwide, and recently began working as a delivery driver for Amazon. 

They filled a need in the workforce, with 8 million open jobs nationwide last month, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that over the next eight years, there will be an estimated 37,300 job openings for paralegals and legal assistants, and 96,300 openings for light truck delivery drivers nationally each year.

The Chukhniai family doesn’t fit the negative stereotypes portrayed by anti-immigration sentiments. They arrived in the U.S. legally, are not drug users, have no criminal record and don’t rely on government assistance. 

“We rent a home here and have always tried to contribute positively to our community,” Tetiana said. “In 2024, we successfully paid our taxes and intend to do so again this year.”

They’ve enjoyed celebrating American holidays, visiting the Green Bay Packers’ Lambeau Field and spending time at Lake Michigan in Manitowoc and Sheboygan. During a visit to the lake last summer, Ivan is credited with saving a child from drowning. 

Tetiana keeps a copy of the Sheboygan police report on hand in the event it could help sway any support in their efforts to stay in this country.

Migrants who arrive in the U.S. on humanitarian parole can apply for temporary protected status (TPS), which allows them to avoid deportation for a designated time and apply for extensions if their country is unsafe to return to. The couple applied for TPS a year ago and are awaiting approval. 

In December, Tetiana and Ivan applied for re-parole and work authorization renewals, following the proper steps and timelines, but approval was delayed. Then last week, the Department of Homeland Security issued an internal memo that has not been made public, indefinitely freezing the issuance of new immigration benefits for several programs. 

CBS News reported receiving a statement Feb. 19 from the Department of Homeland Security confirming that immigration program applications would be on hold indefinitely ""pending the completion of additional vetting to identify any fraud, public safety, or national security concerns.""

This impacted Uniting for Ukraine, the CHNV process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to remain in the country on a temporary basis, and the Family Reunification Process for nationals from Colombia, Ecuador, Haiti and Cuba, enabling them to stay in the U.S. while awaiting family-sponsored green cards.

With immigration programs paused, Tetiana and Ivan’s work authorizations expired last week and their employers were required to terminate them. 

Matt Brehmer of Brehmer Law said he would “absolutely” rehire Tetiana if she were able to obtain a valid work permit.

""The integrity that she has in doing right by herself and her family is very admirable,” he said. “Although she has been through an unimaginable experience, she fights every day to show up for her family and does what she can to provide the best life for them.”

Jennie Murray, president and chief executive of the National Immigration Forum, said the immigration program freeze that went into effect last week will remove 3 million authorized workers from the workforce. 

“To take any authorized worker from the system hurts American businesses and hurts individual Americans, because it will only impact our supply-chain issues and our inflation,” Murray said.

She pointed to polling that indicates voters want the administration to only prioritize removing violent criminals and not individuals who are contributing to society, “and they certainly don't want to see families separated,” she said.

The Chukhniai and Jauquet families have contacted their local representatives and congressmen about the matter. 

“I'm embarrassed that our government puts them through these hoops because they are such good people,” Jauquet said.

The situation has taken a heavy emotional and financial toll on the Chukhniai family, who are now facing the prospect of having to move back in with their sponsor family or potentially leave the U.S. altogether.

“I don't know if I would have enough patience to keep going here and trying to survive, or in the end, we have to, again, pack all of our life into three suitcases and leave; we don't know,” Tetiana said.

Without the ability to work, the family won’t be able to afford basic necessities like food, let alone rent and other bills. 

“We need to tell people what’s going on and it’s worse than you can imagine,” she said. “It’s not happening on television somewhere, it’s right here, and it’s closer than they can even imagine.”

But she doesn’t place blame on the current administration. As a non-citizen who can't vote, Tetiana said it would be wrong to choose a side. With the country so divisive, she instead asked for unity. 

“If we could let people know what’s going on and even one person would change their mind, or would think more about that, or would pray, that’s worth it,” she said.

The family’s situation is not unique. Immigration attorney Molly Smiltneek of Oshkosh said she’s heard from other Ukrainians living in Wisconsin who entered the U.S. legally under the previous administration and are now facing similar challenges.

“Looking at it from their perspective, they're trying to figure out ways that they could stay and continue rebuilding their lives in the United States, or return to war in Ukraine, or a war-torn country that, you know, their homes may or may not exist anymore, that might not be safe for them in any way,” she said.

President Trump signed an executive order in January targeting immigration programs, promising to “terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States,” implemented under the Biden administration. 

Smiltneek said if that happens, humanitarian parolees like the Chukhniai family would be considered “out of status” and could be targeted for deportation and removal from the U.S. under an expedited process. 

Currently, the only pathway for migrants who came to the U.S. temporarily under the programs to obtain a green card and be granted permanent residency is to apply for asylum, a process that is also being significantly restricted under the new executive orders, making it inaccessible for many. 

“I think the administration at the time assumed that Congress would take action for both Ukrainians and Afghans to give them a path to stay once they were here, to support our allies, and that never happened,” Smiltneek said.

She added that the people who came to the U.S. under the programs, and the host families who supported them, feel betrayed.

“We made promises to them, and we said that you would be safe here, and we aren't keeping those promises, and I think it is a terrible example of our broken immigration system,” Smiltneek said. “I'm saddened that so many people who thought they at least had some security are now incredibly and rightfully fearful of deportation and removal, and that doesn't serve us, or serve our country, or serve humanity well.”

She warned that the country is entering a dark time for immigration and asked that people provide direct support to immigrants, donate to or volunteer for organizations who work with immigrants, and advocate and stand up for them.

“Those of us who have the privilege to, need to hold our elected representatives responsible, and tell them what this means to you and why it's important that we treat human beings with dignity and respect,” Smiltneek said.

Up until they lost their jobs last week, Tetiana and Ivan were making plans to purchase a house. That – like many things – is now on hold. 

Tetiana had always heard the U.S. was founded on principles of independence, justice and fairness, and would like her family to have a chance at the American dream.

“I used to represent clients’ rights in the court in front of the justice,” she said, “and now I try to find this justice here.”

"Looking to make a big move. Sheboygan, Wisconsin? I’m done with the state I live in and it’s never ending attempt at unconstitutional legislation, and I want to move somewhere with a kinder and better educated population (not looking for a town of Harvard grads, it’s all relative). I’m from somewhere much much warmer and more conservative than Wisconsin, and I know nearly nothing about WI (except what I’ve seen on Charlie Berens’ YouTube channel, lol). I read that Sheboygan is nice and noticed that the real estate seems relatively affordable. I (36m) have no kids, work from home (Data Scientist), and don’t want to live in an expensive city. I do need a medium-sized house, though, because I need an office, gym space, and plenty of room for my three dogs and I (I’m huge - think Eddie Hall). 

My main concerns (other than my general ignorance about Wisconsin) is the climate for my high-energy medium-large dogs and that I don’t unknowingly move into a homogeneous community of some kind that affects potential social interactions and resale prospects if things don’t work out. (I don’t want to live in an unofficial retirement community or a devoutly religious community, and I don’t think it’d be easy to resell). This brings me to my main question: Sheboygan seems beautiful, why can I afford it, and are there any standout details one should be aware of before house hunting?",reddit,general madison
"Ok.. this is my recommendation... If you want a nice experience and **not** a crazy night with 6+ drinks, getting drink and forget about that day.. I recommend you going to ***Robin Room*** (if it's a weekend it will be crowded). 

It's my favorite bar around so far.. It has a cozy environment and the bartenders are pretty nice, I recommend you talking with them and ask them what do they recommend, no one will know more about their cocktails than them.  Their drink menu may be a bit overwhelming so I recommend to just ask them, tell them your preferences (this is really important bc I like sour and smoky flavors but for you it can be herbal and sweet.. idk)  and they should have something for you. 

Also don't believe in the ""if you mix different types of drinks you'll get drunk"".... That's a myth.... If you get more than 3-4 drinks you will get drunk no matter what (depending on your tolerance, it may be more than 2 for you... Just don't drink too fast, you'll notice it) always have a glass of water to be sipping from it and just try different things, if you didn't like the first just try something else... There are so many options that the only way to know what you like is trying them, always keeping in mind your taste preferences.

And don't forget to have a rich carbohydrate meal before drinking (there is a mexican place in front of RR, I've heard that it's pretty good).

3) You can live wherever you want even as a freshman.  Off-campus housing may or may not be cheaper (depends how dumpy of a place you want/how much you want to overload the building) but probably comes with longer commute and more responsibilities (cooking for yourself, for one).

"I went to Madison as did 2 cousins while 5 of my aunts/uncles went to Whitewater.  You can do well at either school.  My cousin's wife is a professor at Whitewater in their Educational Foundations department.

Madison as a school and a town is bigger and more diverse.  You will have more opportunities for everything...different areas of study, different people to meet, different experiences to have, different trouble to get into.  If you to go UW-W your classmates will be commuters, some people from Chicago, and in-state kids.  At Madison you'll have the chance to meet people from across the country and around the world.

If you are dead-set on elementary education you can get a perfectly good degree either place and they'll essentially serve you the same - so cost-wise, Whitewater is the no-brainer.  However, if you find you want to change majors or pursue something else, Madison will have more options.  If you wanted to get into school administration (a more lucrative path than being a kindergarten teacher, albeit with way more headaches) starting at Madison may be better but you'd need an advanced degree anyway - which, as a teacher, you'll want to pursue anyway for continuing education requirements and to secure raises.

Both schools party pretty hard; they're colleges in Wisconsin so of course there's a barley pop or two to be had.

"No problem, glad it helped!  When you go to the union if the weather is cooperating I highly recommend walking from there over to State Street.  Easy to walk up that to the Capitol and a lot of the other areas I mentioned.  State Street is definitely a bit of a centerpiece for Madison.

Alternatively if you enjoyed the biking, there’s also a trail that starts at the student union on the lake side and runs through the woods and campus along the lake to the near west side.

A few other things I forgot to mention-

- Henry Vilas Zoo (free, and near downtown)

- Olbrich Gardens (wildlife atrium, not sure if it’s worth the trip to Monona but if you like this sort of thing it nice)

- The Old Fashioned (a uniquely Wisconsin restaurant on the Capitol square with fun twists on very traditional fare.  It’s lively even during the week and a nice place if your solo to pop up to the bar and have a meal)

If you make a return trip to Madison, the two things I’d try to catch are the Saturday Farmers Market (April - November), and a home football game at Camp Randall.  The former is an incredibly large market with a boisterous atmosphere and a hallmark feature of the city.  The latter has a fun atmosphere on Regent St where all the bars and restaurants have a tailgate and you see Madison residents celebrating good times.

You'll get a bus pass with your seg fees, so even better to make use of it. The bus stops often get you much closer to campus buildings than the parking lots do.


You'll also want to budget in parking. A parking space at an apartment can get pricey. $50-100+ a month, more expensive closer to campus or if you want covered parking. Parking on campus is really expensive and I wouldn't recommend it.

"NOT-OD-25-068 Timeline:

                Friday afternoon 2/7/25:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) released the directive that effective immediately all NIH grant indirect funding costs will be capped to 15%. https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-068.html

                On Monday morning 2/10/25: indirect funding was distributed at 15% (a 50-75% decrease for UW-Madison)

                On Monday afternoon 2/20/25: 22 states signed onto a lawsuit against the NIH seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) of the NOT-OD-25-068 directive. This TRO was subsequently granted. https://www.mass.gov/doc/nih-tro/download

 

M-25-13 Timeline: (https://www.rid.uscourts.gov/state-new-york-et-al-v-trump-et-al-25-cv-00039-jjm-pas)

                Monday 1/27/25: The office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum directing all federal agencies to end  financial distribution to non-individuals  until comprehensive reviews are conducted. Set to go in effect the 29th with no definitive end date. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25506391-m-25-13-temporary-pause-to-review-agency-grant-loan-and-other-financial-assistance-programs/

                Tuesday 1/28/25: Multiple Governmental agencies were shut out of ASAP (the federal financial payment distribution system).

                Tuesday 1/28/25: Motion for Emergency temporary restraining order brought forth by 23 states against the office of management and budget.

                Wednesday 1/29/25: Updated memo circulated by OMB to restore access to some programs such as HeadStart and Medicare.

                Thursday 1/30/25:     Temporary restraining order (TRO) issued against M-25-13 directing all funding pauses to cease.

                Friday 2/7/25: Motion to enforce the TRO . As the OMB had yet to comply with the court orders and restore grant funding to all agencies in compliance with the TRO issued a week prior.

                As of today 2/9/25 , the OMB and trump administration still hasn’t complied with federal court orders requiring them to disburse the federal funds identified in M-25-13. In response to the court in plain text demanding the immediate compliance with the courts orders, Vice president J.D. Vance took to X and wrote:

“If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that’s also illegal. Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.”

It should be further added that in the case of M-25-13, the OMB has partially complied with the TRO, but has refused to follow the court rulings on all the affected governmental agencies and continues to halt millions of dollars of federal funding . https://www.rid.uscourts.gov/state-new-york-et-al-v-trump-et-al-25-cv-00039-jjm-pas

Currently, as a consequence of M-25-13, UW-Madison has had to stop research and loan disbursements to specific labs and affected funding areas (comprehensive list to be provided at a later date). For a list of continued non-academic federal funding freezes to disbursements around the US are documented in brief here: https://www.rid.uscourts.gov/sites/rid/files/motiontoenforce.pdf.

 

                What can we expect from  NOT-OD-25-068 in light of M-25-13?

As of yet, it is to be seen to what extent the NIH complies with the judicial system’s temporary restraining order. But, even if there is compliance with the NOT-OD-25-068’s TRO we can almost certainly expect the executive branch to not fully comply and block indirect cost funding to specific areas that match their targeted agenda. This will be a hard situation in terms of mobilizing public disapproval as there will be a partial restoration of funds. This likely scenario will mean the executive branch is continuing  to operate outside of its constitutional authority in the same manner as we are seeing in the case of M-25-13. The strategy appears to be: illegally take everything, in response to the courts  give back 90% of it and hope there isn’t an outcry about the last 10%. (let us not underestimate their ability to manipulate public perception as many believe M-25-13 is being fully complied in accordance with court orders)

 

For brevity’s sake I will save for future updates the information I have gathered from the director of the primate center and other university officials pertaining to the precise budgetary cuts the university admin has detailed to be put into place in the scenario of NOT-OD-25-068 being fully adhered to by the NIH. Instead I want to leave you with two parting thoughts.

1.      There is hope. We are seeing the courts respond swiftly. And we are witnessing coordinated responses against the Executive branch’s blatant disregard for our courts system. Moreover, staying well informed and unified will be more important going forward. To this end, I have been communicating with local organizations such as MADSA and the YDSA to inform and stay in communication with groups sympathetic to our mission.

 

2.      Written into the NOT-OD-25-068 is the expressed intent to privatize our public bioscience research. I find this unconscionable, and we must fight to ensure that science is funded by the people for the people and not by the billionaires for the billionaires.

"Why are Wisconsinites so opposed to public transportation? Is it just boomer bullshit, or is there actually a reason why you can't even talk about public transit projects without hearing a bunch of whining? Mostly from people who live in the middle of nowhere... about how transit is a ""waste of money"" and how ""no one"" supposedly uses it.

That last part in hilarious to me, considering the Hiawatha is the only Amtrak line not on the coasts that operates more than six times per day. Not only that, but it took the Borealis less than a month to turn so much of a profit that they decided to run another line. 

I've even heard some urban planning geniuses try to explain it away by claiming it's only people from Chicago riding those trains. Weird how they can never explain why Milwaukee is somehow not full of daily commuters from Chicago. 

It's not even just rail transit either. What made me make this post is all the negativity surrounding BRT in Madison. Which was especially hilarious to me because people's biggest argument against the streetcar in Milwaukee is the supposed superiority and flexibility of busses.

Same thing with the proposed Metra extension through Kenosha, Racine and Milwaukee. Or the proposed Amtrak extension from Milwaukee through Oshkosh, Appleton, and Green Bay.

**On the right:**

they pledge their allegiance and loyalty to their cult leader. Nothing else matters to them. If facts or evidence prove them wrong, it’s denied and dismissed as fake news. All that matters is what Trump says. if Trump does wrong, they run to his defense and make excuse after excuse. If any republican is held accountable, they claim it’s a witch hunt and political persecution no matter what the evidence is or says. If studies prove them wrong, then the studies are fake. republicans ousted their own speaker for compromising with the democrats despite that being how our system of governance is designed to operate. Any Republican that speaks out against Donald Trump are instantly excommunicated from the party and lose all political relevance and future; This causes the entire party to be full of a bunch of grifters that don’t believe the things they say. Republicans only do what they do and say what they say because they know their constituents are cult members who will throw them out if they go against Trump or dare speak the truth. that’s what happened to Liz Cheney. And Adam Kinzinger. And Mitt Romney. And Mike Pence. Hundreds of Republicans behind closed doors denounce Trump, but will never do so in public. The Republican party is overwhelmingly funded by billionaires and large corporations. Republicans have stopped talking any amount of policy or tried passing any amount of policy. This has happened because their policy is so unpopular and doesn’t work. Policy does not get their constituents fired up. This is why they make up fake issues and drive culture wars. None of the party is genuine in their beliefs. This has been the least productive Congress in US history because they are incapable of governing with MAGA Republicans at the helm. How can you complain about everything under the sun yet refused to pass legislation to solve such issues? The governor of Michigan was almost kidnapped and assassinated and MAGA made fun of her despite them being the cause of it. Paul Pelosi was beaten in the skull with a hammer and they made fun of him. 

Trump calls for violence, tries to overthrow the government with a mob of his supporters and tries to install fake electors to force his way into power while he lies about the election that he lost fair and Square. He then gets convicted of 34 felonies by a jury he helped select. He gets found liable for rape and financial fraud. He’s successfully delays his other three trials because he’s so afraid of being found guilty. 30k lies while in office. Bully to the core. Despite all of these facts, the right defends him, gets behind him, and doubles down. If he was on the left, we would’ve thrown him out years ago because we are objective. Look at what we did with Biden

**On the left:**

We don’t pledge our allegiance to any person. Any one man or woman. We are objective and are always changing our minds and views. If any elected officials commit wrong, we discard them and replace them. Democrats that criticize our elected leaders are not ousted from the party and their opinions are respected. Joe Biden did terrible in the debate so we called on him to drop out. Hunter Biden was convicted of a crime, so we denounced him and said he should be held accountable. Bob Menendez was convicted of a crime, So we denounced him, demanded he resign, and be held accountable. Andrew Cuomo, someone I met and admired, was accused of sexual assault and mismanaging nursing homes during COVID-19, it was found that these allegations had merit, so I and the rest of the party denounced him and demanded he resign. we make no excuses. We hold no politician above the law. we adhere to facts no matter what the facts say. We adhere to statistics and peer reviewed studies, no matter what they say. We swear, loyalty to facts and evidence, not to one person. We don’t push culture wars, and always talk policy because our proposed policy is so popular. We try to actually govern and fix things for the good of the people through genuine legislation that later gets blocked by Republicans who refuse to negotiate or do anything. The Democratic Party is overwhelmingly funded by small dollar donors. Yes, a few billionaires and corporations, but not nearly as much as the Republican party. Democrats are constantly trying to negotiate with Republicans in good faith to which we get none back in return because their sole purpose is to cause dysfunction and then run on the dysfunction during election season.
Donald Trump almost gets assassinated by a Republican because of the violent toxic divisive environment he created and democrats denounce it and wish Trump well. republicans can’t even denounce January 6….

-Cook your own food. Don’t buy frozen pre made meals, don’t go out, prep and make your own food and eat left overs.

-Don’t drink alcohol. If money is tight this should be the first thing to be removed from your life, for more reasons than just money.

-Get a job through the university where you can get paid to study/do homework. The library and the Union worked best- don’t focus on pay or your interest, get something you can get paid to do homework at least 1/4 of your time.

-If you’re on a meal plan, stay on it strictly and do your best to take calories with you if you find yourself eating off your plan.

-If not on meal plan take a look at your grocery choices. Organic anything, candy, snacks, non water beverages, packaged frozen section, and dessert are luxury items. Period. Look to increase food efficiency this is often enough to get most people turned around

"Hello, 36 y o grad and current resident here, just my opinions from my experience:

1 congrats that’s huge! admittance into a specific college brings additional expenses for resources of the specialization being studied 

2 that’s an interesting question. It depends on budget and lifestyle. Living in  and near campus, will never need one ever as long as you can make sacrifices re food costs. The ability to eat out more often and accept higher than average grocery prices makes the need for a car non existent. Getting out to woodmans is possible on the bus but that’s a commitment, I did fine that way though. Housing is much cheaper off campus and some students like to be out of the crazy.

I am leasing a parking spot that is very close to campus (401 Chamberlain Ave) so very close to the hospital and right next to bus lines that can take you anywhere on campus in around 5/10 minutes. The rent is only $125 a month and it's covered which is a better deal than most other places downtown.,reddit,downtown
"Not a tire expert so this is only tangentially related, but if you live down town you probably won't drive that much anyway, at least not to get to campus. If you're not downtown, look up the bus rapid transit lines and try to be on one. Not only will it make it way easier to get to campus, but when the weather is bad you can avoid driving until the snow fully melts off the roads (usually a few days at most), and then it won't really matter what kind of tires you're working with. 

Madison winters are unpredictable-though they're getting warmer on average. This year we didn't have any lasting snow until this week, (and after next week it'll probably all be gone) next year we could have it for 3 months straight. If you're at all worried about driving in snow, being on the bus line sets you up so you can at least get to campus and a grocery store without driving. Then you can make judgement calls for non-essential trips based on your comfort level.",reddit,downtown
"If you can't get anything close to you, there's lots of neighborhoods further out along the bus lines that don't have any restrictions except when it snows. Just make sure if there's any snow in the forecast you plan accordingly for which side of the street you're on, otherwise you might have to move it to the other side. Closer to downtown you're gonna have a harder time, although some of the neighborhoods by Edgewood only have one day a week that you can't park, so you can probably drive around there and find a street that lets you park the whole time. Either way you'll have to bus or walk a ways to get back to campus, but barring a freak blizzard you won't have too move it.

Otherwise if you're willing to pay, you can park in some of the campus garages and only have to move it once. I think you can even just leave and drive right back in, you wouldn't have to find somewhere else.",reddit,downtown

And any custom flag you'd like. They even have Flag etiquette on their page, which matters to me because Republicans have been desecrating the flag for years, meanwhile getting pissy when someone burns it.

From their page ""The flag should never be used for any advertising purpose. It should not be embroidered, printed or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use. ... The flag should not be used as part of a costume or athletic uniform, except that a flag patch may be used on the uniform of military personnel, fireman, policeman and members of patriotic organizations.""

"27th and State Milwaukee WI. Keep your eyes open while traveling through. Had a sketchy run-in while driving my daughter downtown today. We were lucky as the individual was not violent, but it could have gone completely wrong. Luckily, nothing happened, and we were able to drive through, but I totally didn't think that area was that bad. I was showing her how to navigate the through streets to get places fast if you hit traffic off I-94. I should have known better since the Ambassador Hotel isn't that far from there, and that place is a haven for drug dealers and such. This could have been ""such a day"" as the individual was getting angry because we couldn't help them. Not sure if they were in trouble; they kept asking for money and wouldn't take no for an answer! I'm just happy the car in front of us moved so we could leave because there was another group of about eight individuals hanging out at the opposite corner. Usually, everything is fine when I go to Milwaukee, but this was very out of the ordinary, and to see that many people hanging there in 36-degree weather for no reason was strange. Plus, the car in front of us stopped, blocking us. It was not a very comfortable feeling because my daughter was with me. She was rattled pretty badly by what was happening and how the individual was acting. She had never seen that before, and she is a big part of her boyfriend's family, who are from Chicago and of black heritage. So she is not racist at all, but she was scared of this guy! And she really didn't want to go to class because last year a girl was raped in the MATC building about 20 minutes after she used it. This is two close calls in less than a year!

"Looking for some land and realtor advice (MSN-MKE) So as I look into 2025 to set myself up best for some goals I have in 2026, I'm wanting to get some stuff set up on the back burner, main thing I'm wanting help with is any recommendations anyone might have for a realtor in either the Madison or Milwaukee area, Google seemed mildly helpful so I thought I'd ask here

Doubt too many people here would have any recommendations for a manufactured home retailer/dealer but I've been able to more or less figure out the best places to look for assistance with that lol

Though if anyone here has any experience with manufactured homes I'd have to see if there are any questions that I would have. I think main thing is just making sure that all in the cost is less than a site built home. 

Not really looking for advice on what I should do with the land, I'm aware that trailers placed on land still more or less depreciate like a trailer and can actually hold back the land value if the trailer is sold with the land. But if the acquisition for everything is less than a site built home then it's worth it I feel. Though that's heavily dependent on a lot of factors if a site built ends up being less or the same.

I'm sure you guys get plenty of people talking about wanting to move to your state, I like to think I'm different than the majority of those transplants since I'm from Minnesota (and I don't think there's a lot of Minnesotans trying to move to Wisconsin) and it's basically the same thing. I personally think the anti-Wisconsin rhetoric espoused by some Minnesotans (outside of friendly sports rivalry) is propaganda from the affluent city of Edina (which we in Minnesota like to call ""Every Day I Need Attention"") I really appreciate Wisconsin (though the like 3.5 hours from Hudson to Madison is insanely boring lmao I guess at least you go through Wisconsin Dells and Baraboo which spices things up a little.)

My boyfriend is from California originally, but has spent the last decade and some change in Alabama and after a few days back at the end of November this year, actually exploring parts of southern Wisconsin he is fully onboard with a move northward for us (we took a day trip in 2022 just across the border when we were in Minnesota to the city of Hudson but I can't say that exactly counts lol)",reddit,general madison
"Vote not Showing Up on MyVote Just here to share some light about what happens after election day. 

Voter participation is entered by hand at the clerks office. There isn't anything on your ballot that connects it to you. You don't sign your ballot, there isn't a bar code, that's for voter confidentiality. It is not recorded anywhere HOW you vote. The machine you put your ballot in is basically a giant abacus, all it does is count.

Where you're issued a ballot, you sign a poll book. A voter number is put next to your name. At the end of the election. The ending voter number in the poll book should match the number of ballots the machine says it has per ward. This is another check to make sure someone hasn't voted twice. If they don't match, we need to find out why. If there is a mismatch, it's usually because a number was skipped or the same number was issued twice. Poll workers are people. 

There is a poll book per ward. Once we are sure all the numbers match for that ward, we will scan the barcodes next to the names to record voter participation. 

""I voted absentee, saw my ballot now it's gone."" What you saw was that the clerks office received your ballot, it's filed and ready to be counted. The counting of absentee ballots doesn't begin until 7am on election day, when the election actually starts. This is another check to stop a duplicate vote. Your absentee ballots are counted twice by hand against the issued and returned absentee ballot list and then again when fed through the ballot counting machine. These numbers must match. We're counting ballots, not the races. Once the numbers for the entire ward, absentee voters and in-person voters, match, election participation will be scanned. Again by hand and there are over 90 wards in Kenosha alone.

""I voted early at City Hall"" Wisconsin technically doesn't have early voting, it's in-person absentee voting, IPAV. So you're in the same pool as the people who did mail in ballots. Your vote wasn't counted until Tuesday. 

Hope this answers some questions!",reddit,general madison
"The thing in the middle is not a float. It appears to be a pier section and it looks to be very solidly anchored. I would assume the gap between the two is a missing pier section(s). 

Working under those assumptions, yes, this is totally legal.

I think it is out for winter storage, so this would fall under good home ownership. Perhaps it's not in place yet for Spring, or perhaps it floated away. Maybe they wait for memorial day weekend or spawning season to end. Maybe it's in the garage being rebuilt or stored in a shed waiting for them to get there

Either way, ""No Parking"" makes sense if there is normally a pier there, as the pier then falls under riparian rights for that shoreline. Not to mention if it's a floating pier section, having a chain for the boat tie off makes sense.

Check back in a couple weeks and see if it's in place. Call it in if you want, but I would work under the assumption that you're making a headache for the actual owner who is most likely doing whatever maintenance on their own schedule.",reddit,general madison
"I mention this constantly when we mention why is there no East to West high speed options. Why rails cross country are in such deplorable shape. Scott Walker reflected the mind set of Republicans in general, who see their cars as a badge of freedom. They cannot imagine having to bus, because buses are dirty, and slow and OMG subsidized. Now they are at the mercy of some one else, and who knows who might get on, they might have to give up control and share some space with other humans. 

Because of a mind set very similar to this, trains lost federal protection and funding of the government back in the 70s. Most of the world uses trains extensively. Trains are sometimes entirely federaly funded, and in some countries are seen as national symbols. But here in the USA we treat trains with the same respect as we do the metric system. Refusing to abandon Imperial numbers I think is born of the same stubborn selfishness, the same idea that it makes us more free, that drives us to refuse to use public transportation.

"Dismal state budget outlook Amid steep funding cuts at the federal level, I don't think enough Wisconsinites realize how much this could affect the state budget, particularly school and municipal aid.

**Schools**

For example, the DPI reported schools collectively received $1 billion in federal aid, including assistance for special education and school meals.

If districts lose federal funding, the money has to come from somewhere else, which likely places the burden on a Republican-controlled Legislature that has historically underfunded special education for Wisconsin schools.

Republican lawmakers have long relied on federal funding to divert responsibility away from them. 

Remember ESSER funds? When districts faced looming deficits during the COVID-19 pandemic, state lawmakers suggested using these funds, despite federal guidance saying otherwise.

Now that these funds have been exhausted, coupled with federal uncertainty, I am doubtful that the Republican Legislature will do anything to remedy the situation.

Time and time again, they have avoided responsibility, often telling local school districts to present operational referendums. 

I mean, come on, operational referendums have continued to increase in Wisconsin.

Amid operational referendums, I have oftentimes seen communities become divided, leading to a vicious circle every 3-5 years because most of them are for non-recurring purposes. It is like a short-reprieve for districts, therefore, kicking the problematic can down the road in hopes the state legislature would increase funding. 

But some of this could be avoided if the State Legislature can find some sort of solution. I am not an economic expert, nor do I have any answers, but there has to be a better way to fund education in Wisconsin. 

**Municipalities**

Republicans have repeatedly shown disdain for large communities, particularly Milwaukee, so I wouldn't bank on them offering any further assistance. 

At one point, Republicans refused to pass a bill related to lead pipe replacement, stating it would help Milwaukee too much.

It isn't just Milwaukee.

Like schools, now I am seeing communities in urban and rural areas place operational referendums on the ballot for essential services, like public safety and infrastructure improvements.

Wisconsin ranks eighth in the nation in property tax burden, according to [taxfoundation.org](http://taxfoundation.org) data from 2023.

The percentages seem right, but the order/ranking is wrong, there are some states missing from the list that should be on the list, and there are some states on the list that shouldn't be on the list like Texas, Florida, Georgia, and Arizona. 


This is the correct list based on the link you provided:
1. West Virginia (Red)- 21.3%
2. Mississippi (Red)- 22.8%
3. Arkansas (Red)- 23.8%

11. Wyoming (Red)- 28.2%

17. Iowa (Red?)- 29.3%
18. Missouri (Red)- 29.9%
19. Michigan (Purple)- 30.0%
20. Alaska (Red)- 30.0%


The above list still proves the point you are trying to make. 


HOWEVER, according to the link you provided (https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/educational-attainment-by-state), the educational attainment by state does not vary by much. Minnesota (36.8%) ranks as #10 best in educational attainment, yet New Mexico (28.1%), which ranks as #10 worst in educational attainment, is only 8.7 percentage points below Minnesota. 45 out of 50 US states have an educational attainment under 39.9%. Sometimes what matters is not only the rankings but also how much the stats actually vary, and in my opinion the stats don't vary by much (unless you are comparing the #1 best educational attainment state to the #1 worst educational attainment state maybe). The above list proves that an overwhelming majority of the bottom 20 states in educational attainment are red states, but I think what is debatable is whether the difference between the bottom 20 states in educational attainment and the top 20 states in educational attainment is that significant. 


Also, I think a more important question is what you are trying to prove. Are you trying to imply that states with more college graduates are somehow superior? Because in my opinion, 4 year college is overrated. It's important for some people, but many people go to college not even knowing what they're going to major in or what they want to do after college. And some of these college graduates pick pretty useless majors and just end up working jobs that don't require a college education. I saw a guy I knew from college working as a waiter at a restaurant despite being a college graduate (I think he was a Literature major). I dropped out of college after sophomore year due to a combination of mental health issues and doubts about my major, yet I felt bad for him because at least I dropped out once I realized I was wasting my time and money. Imagine having to pay $40,000+ of student loans for a college education that landed you a job that you could have gotten without a college education. And some jobs that require a college education don't even pay much. I know someone with a master's degree who works a job that she enjoys but pays only $30,000-$40,000 a year; at the top of my head, I know 2 people who make twice that amount, and both of them don't even have bachelor's degrees (one went to trade or technical school to become a mechanic or something like that, the other works in manufactoring and climbed up the econonic ladder over time). There's other routes besides 4 year college, there's technical school, trades, military, or just working at a job and learning from job experience. Getting a bachelor's degree is necessary for some people (pre-med, lawyer, etc.), but not for everyone, and the problem is too many people go to college without a plan in mind with what they want to do after. The point is trying to make is that maybe a state having a lower educational attainment for bachelors degrees isn't a bad thing.",reddit,general madison

"Can Judge Schimel Still Pull Off a Shocking Win? The Numbers Say It’s a Long Shot—But Here’s Exactly What It Would Take (Wisconsin Supreme Court Judge Race Breakdown) 12% of votes left! 
Hey everyone,

There’s been a lot of buzz about whether Candidate Schimel with Elon Musk's bribery can still catch up in this tight judicial race, so I ran the numbers— with 42% of the vite counted if you’re in Candidate Crawford’s corner, the math is looking very reassuring!!! 🇺🇸


Latest Numbers: 9:00PM CT

Judge Crawford: 545,025 votes (57%)

Judge Schimel: 403,777 votes (43%)

Total counted votes: 948,802

Estimated percentage counted: 42%

Estimated total votes: ~2,259,529

Remaining votes: ~1,310,727

Current vote gap: 141,248 in favor of Crawford

What Would Schimel Need?

To win, Schimel must overcome a 141k vote deficit from the remaining 1.3 million votes.

That means:

Schimel needs at least 796,612 of those votes.

That’s about 60.8% of all remaining votes.

Leaving just 39.2% for Candidate Crawford.


So, Judge Schimel would need a 60.8 to 39.2% split, or roughly a 1.55 to 1 ratio in their favor going forward.



Odds? Let’s Be Real.

Candidate Schimel has been getting 43% of the vote so far. Jumping to 60.8% over the next 1.3 million votes would require a massive demographic shift in the uncounted areas.

Mathematically, the odds of that happening—without a drastic and clear reason—are under 1%, realistically closer to 0.1%.


Conclusion:

Judge Crawford isn’t just leading—she's sitting on a statistically dominant position. While it’s never officially over until all the votes are in, the math paints a very clear picture.

Unless the rest of the vote is shockingly skewed toward Schimel, Judge Crawford is on track for a solid win in this judge race.


TL;DR:
Judge Schimel needs 60.8% of the remaining 1.3M votes to win. That’s a major uphill climb from their current 43%.
Odds: less than 1%.

Judge Crawford is heavily favored!!! 🇺🇸",reddit,general madison

Wisconsin is a strong contender for me, especially since I’ve seen some promising job postings in areas like Green Bay, the fox valley and other mid-size cities. That said, it's unlikely I’ll end up in Milwaukee, even though it's Wisconsin’s largest city. Thats because it has a mortuary school. Despite it being a small program there it makes landing an apprenticeship there much more competitive due to the high volume of students already trying to secure those same positions. That being said, other than getting used to the cold it seems like I wouldn't have that hard of a time getting along with wisconsinites or intergrating into the culture.

Any tips or insights on the job market in Wisconsin (especially outside Milwaukee) are more than welcome. I will be going to green bay in a few weeks to begin networking, but ill also get to spend a little bit of time in sheboygan. whether it’s companies to look into, areas to avoid, or anything else helpful. Thanks in advance!",reddit,general madison
"Relocating around Waupun Hey there everyone! My husband and I are ~potentially~ relocating to the area for two job offers, around the beginning of April, and I’m trying to think a little ahead. 
I’m curious if anyone has a lead on private landlords? Who to avoid, areas to avoid, where to find the rentals online? 
We have the option of RV living for a moment to get situated, or using AirBNB while trying to find something that would fit our needs. 
  - Pet friendly
  - Preference is a house vs an apartment, but open to both options.

"I am posting this to every state subreddit that has Republican senators, please write to them to ask what it would take to impeach Trump I am from NJ, and have written to my senators, I believe Cory Booker will definetly vote for impeachment after his 25 hour fillibuster. At this point the only thing that can save the country is Republican senators voting for impeachment. Only you guys have the power to change their mind. Day by day Trumps authoritarianism and corruption increases, this most likely will only get worse until the constitution is totally degraded. It would also help if Republican voters can also mention that they are Republicans who are concerned.

Here are some topics I reccomend mentioning, try to write it differently so they dont suspect its all coming from one person:

* Trump has openly defied a unanimous ruling by the supreme court, this is unprecedented in American history. He has also defied rulings by lower courts, and has declared a war on the rule of law in this country. He is not only targetting specific law firms, but also the American Bar association itself. These attacks on the rule of law and judicial branch are a great dishonoring of those who built this great system. These actions will degrade trust in American institutions, and degrade allies trust in the U.S government.
* Remember that you serve the American people, and you took an oath to the constitution. You do not serve Donald Trump, or the fanatics that support this, if Donald Trump is going against the constitition it is your responsibility as a senator to protect it. Your role as a congress person will become meaningless anyways if things continue on this path. Im not sure what the purpose is of being a congress person if the supreme ruler will continue to bypass your authority.
* Many young soldiers have died to protect the constitution and the American way of life, you should be willing if need be to sacrifice your political career to also protect the constitutions authority. Putting your political career or life above the constitution is a dishonoring of the many sacrifices which have been made to protect it.
* Your children and grandchildren will have to live with your indecicision to act. If this open corruption and authoritarianism continues then they will not be afforded the privelage you had of living in this great country. It is selfish to put your own short term political career goals ahead of what would be best for your children.
* Trumps foreign policy and irresponsible cabinet will lead to a weaker national security. The cabinet leaked war plans on an app that could have been accessed by adversaries, and he is causing a rift with alliiances that took decades to build. He is causing distrust between the U.S and the Eu/Canada, and tourism has dropped significanlty due to fear of the Trump administration. So many sacrifices have been made to build these alliances, and it would be dissapointing to see it degrade over 3 months of foolishness.
* Trump is openly accepting 1 million dollar bribes from CEOs to help boost their businesses. This is open corruption, and it is terrible for the trust that people have in the American economy, and American institutions. This will destroy investment into the U.S economy over generations.
* The U.S dollar and U.S bonds are losing their relevance because these are fundementally based on trust. If people dont trust the U.S government they will not trust their bonds. For the same reason that people dont buy Chinese bonds.

"A breakdown of the gerrymandering lawsuits These two articles I thought provide the best information.

I was confused about which maps had been drawn when and why, legislative vs congressional, and the article from last year breaks that down well.

The other article explains both of the current lawsuits, and how they differ in approach.

I thought these were two good resources for understanding what did happen and what us happening and wanted to share. 

Here's my own synopsis

When Evers redrew the congressional maps in 2022, he was facing a conservative supreme court which had established the ""least change"" rule, which they basically completely made up. To quote [another source](https://www.commoncause.org/wisconsin/press/misguided-state-supreme-court-ruling-for-least-change-voting-maps-creates-urgent-need-for-redistricting-reform/)

&gt;The conservative majority Wisconsin Supreme Court “opinion” last week, was deeply flawed and illogically reasoned — the work of ultra-right wing Justice Rebecca Bradley, whose completely fabricated concept of “least change” as the basis for adjudicating state legislative and congressional voting maps has no legitimate basis in either law or logic. Dissenting progressive Justice Rebecca Dallet pointed out that “no court in Wisconsin, state or federal, has ever adopted a least-change approach.” She went on to say, “The least-change principle is found nowhere in the Wisconsin or U.S. Constitutions.” In other words, Rebecca Bradley concocted a brand new concept simply to support extreme Republican-gerrymandered voting maps.

So Evers had no choice in following the ""least change"" rule if he was going to get it approved at all. 

&gt;Evers’ maps were slightly more favorable to Democrats than the previous decade’s maps, but they didn’t change that much because the court established a “least change” rule when deciding which maps it would approve.

The Court *later*, once it was liberal majority, threw out the ""least change rule."" Legislative maps were redrawn in Feb of last year, but for some reason (no reason given), the Court refused to let Evers redrawn the Congressional maps before the 2024 election. 

Elias had sued last year based on this. That now since the ""least change"" rule was thrown out, legislative maps drawn under those conditions should be redrawn. But then

&gt;Protasiewicz said she decided not to vote on the motion to reconsider the congressional maps because she wasn’t on the court when the underlying case was decided.

Elias is relaunching this same lawsuit now and that's his same approach- challenging the maps since the ""least change"" is no longer in effect

But there's actually a second lawsuit. Both are focusing on the ""least change"" rule but the other lawsuit is taking a different approach

&gt;**Elias Law Group challenge focuses on partisan gerrymandering claims**

&gt;One of the petitions was filed by the Democratic firm Elias Law Group. It claims the state’s congressional map, endorsed by the court’s former conservative majority in 2021, violates several sections of the Wisconsin Constitution. 

&gt;The case claims the map violates Democratic voters’ rights to free speech and association under the state constitution because despite nearly equal numbers of Democratic and Republican votes in Wisconsin’s statewide elections, the GOP has been able to hold six of eight congressional districts. 

&gt;“This congressional map directly discriminates against Petitioners, who support Democratic candidates in Wisconsin and—because of that affiliation—are effectively silenced and shut out from casting a meaningful congressional vote,” the lawsuit states. “Wisconsin’s Constitution prohibits this injustice several times over. This Court should grant this original action and replace the adopted congressional map with a lawful alternative.”

&gt;The Elias Law Group’s suit also claims the congressional map should be tossed because it was drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers under the “least changes” directive from 2021. In its 2023 ruling that struck down state legislative maps, the court’s liberal majority did not allow parties to use the “least change” criteria, saying it had no basis in the constitution.

&gt;**Campaign Legal Center lawsuit focuses on ‘malapportionment’ and county splits**

&gt;The other lawsuit challenging the congressional map was filed by the Campaign Legal Center, one of the groups behind the successful lawsuit against the state legislative maps. 

&gt;The Campaign Legal Center’s challenge claims the congressional map violates the state constitution’s guarantee of equality because it “does not equally apportion population among Wisconsin’s eight congressional districts.”

&gt;The suit also focused on the number of counties that were split when the current congressional map was approved by the court three years ago. It claims the former conservative majority erroneously put more importance on the “least changes” directive than “traditional redistricting” principles in the Wisconsin Constitution, like minimizing the number of counties that are split to form congressional districts. It alleges an “eight district map need only have seven county splits to achieve population equality” while the current map has 12. 

&gt;“Thus, in addition to being unequally populated, the current congressional map is an improper court-imposed remedy because it elevated ‘least change’ over Wisconsin’s traditional redistricting criteria of minimizing county splits, resulting in the needless splitting apart of counties (and therefore communities of interest),” the lawsuit states.

"You won't get a campus parking pass, but you can pay in a public ramp (I think it's like $2 an hour, so not too bad if it's only for an hour or two each day but it'll add up if you have to be on campus all day twice a week). Just be aware that a lot of them are full by 10 am on weekdays, sometimes even earlier, especially if the weather is bad.

Look at the bus lines and see if there's options to park along them and bus in if you're not in a good spot to walk to a stop. You can also take bikes on the buses if that's feasible for you as a way to get to the bus stop, but that's not a super appealing way to commute in the winter imo, and not everyone has a bike or is able to commute on one anyway. 

The rapid transit lines are probably your best backup. Most start in the suburbs and move in, so there are lots of places along them you could park and then get on the bus. If you're a 30 minute drive from campus I'm guessing you're going to be living close enough to the suburbs for it to not be too out of the way. Even if it is out of the way, it might end up being your best option if you can't get parking downtown.",reddit,downtown

Housing is challenging, I transferred so I can’t speak for dorms but I’ve heard it’s sort of luck of the draw on what dorm you get in, my roommate wanted a dorm in the city part of campus but he couldn’t get one so he instead was put in a dorm in the lakeshore side of campus. Apartments are expensive and in high demand, and you’ll probably need some roommates to split the cost.

"Parking on/near campus is a fucking nightmare. Annual parking passes are over $1k and you will be very unlikely to even be able to get one as an undergrad unless you live far enough out. Any street parking is 2hrs only, and on any given day of the week you’re unable to park on several streets/sides of streets due to street cleaning. You will get a parking ticket. You will get many if you try to street park here (and if it’s past 9am, you’re gonna be driving for a while to even find a spot). Madison has unfortunately recently ruined their bus system a bit - you’ll have harder luck with bus routes if you live in surrounding cities - but they’re still there, you’ll just want to check the address of any potential apartment with current bus routes. I live in Middleton and used to have a bus stop literally right outside my apartment, then when the system changed last June, my nearest stop moved to a 15 minute walk away. You’ll want to check how often those buses come too if you’re outside the Madison city limits. But for a city this size it’s still a pretty good bus system and if you live anywhere near the capitol/downtown/the west side of madison, you’ll have 0 trouble with having great bus access.",reddit,downtown
"So I just graduated and finished my masters like 2 days ago. I unfortunately can’t help with on campus living but I can describe my experience living off campus.
I lived pretty far off campus, basically right at city limits. This was fine for me because I had a car and knew how to drive in the winter. Living off campus did allow me to find more affordable options. However, Madison is not super price friendly to be honest. I had a hard time finding things so start applying asap. Like I cannot stress this enough: you need to start applying now!!!!
The downside of living off campus is that I didn’t really get involved in campus stuff and couldn’t enjoy the night life because I’d have to drive myself home afterwards. However, some of that just comes from being too lazy to drive. My advice would be to go to stuff when you are on campus even if it means staying a little later. My whole thing was that I tried restaurants or food trucks downtown once a week.
Speaking of driving: if you have a car immediately apply for the parking permits which just went up for application. You want the half off grad student one. That does limit which lots you can apply for but let me tell you, my first year I had no permit and I paid so much money.
As for jobs, I worked at one of the libraries which is a super nice job. I worked at Steenbock and was one of several grad students (I think they are hiring right now so apply!). I think there are some jobs that limit to undergrad but a lot are open to everyone. TA jobs are also a good option but a lot harder to get. However if you want more than like 20 hours, go for an off campus job. Currently you can only get like 27 hours max. I was lucky and lived in a crappy studio with cheap rent but for a 2 bed you might want more unless you have a partner supporting you.

"Your only option is to sublease, or to get your own lease and then sublet it for the spring and summer. 

There are VERY few places that do month-month leases and those are likely going to be much farther off-campus (not downtown, Univeristy Ave, Regent, nor Hilldale area), itll be in more residential neighborhoods probably further south. From what ive seen, theyre nonexistent here. Only 12-month and 9-month leases here.

 There is a huge need for housing, so its much more profitable for landlords in the area and off-campus to establish 12-month (or 9-month) leases because then students are tied into a contract and the landlord has secured passive income for 9-12 months. If the student has to leave, they are still tied to the contract and have to pay the rent or be responsible for finding someone else to live there and pay the rent. It wouldnt be as profitable for landlords near UW or with bus routes that can take you to UW to let students make shorter leases. 

You can apply to stay in the dorms and, if you manage to get pulled from the lottery and offered a dorm, live in the dorm and then cancel your contract. However, you will have fees to pay for for violating/canceling the 2024-2025 contract. Also, its a risk on its own because if you wait to see if you were selected to get a dorm, and end up unlucky, most of the good/cheap apartments will be gone. Youll have to try hard to find a good place, wait until January to check out any apartments that start leasing for the fall during that time, or try to join someone elses lease. Lots of people get multi-bedroom places and then later look for roommates. However, I dont anticipate many people being willing to take on a roommate who cannot commit to the full lease term. 

Tldr: you can take a risk to apply and wait to get a dorm and cancel it KNOWING you will have to pay fees for violating the contract. You can get a lease and sublet it for the spring and summer. You can sublease someones place for the fall. 

(Check the sublet procedures wherever you apply. Some places only allow 1 sublease per term, so if you get your own lease, youll need to find someone who can sublet for spring AND summer, or youll have to pay summer on your own. Some places dont allow subleases, and some have options for lease takeovers. Some include hefty subleasing fees and some are cheaper.)",reddit,downtown

Apparently she stopped in our store a few hours before this, but I guess came came back to get more alcohol. I've had people cut her off before when she has come through the second time but this time, she didn't get to come in

"A sincere thank you (in rant form) from a Chicagoan I attended the Bernie Sanders really in Kenosha yesterday and I'm so glad I did. Like many others, I've been feeling rather distraught over the last few months as I watch (with equal parts disbelief, bewilderment, rage, anxiety...) what's happening in our country. The vibe at the rally, was, it turns out, exactly the salve I desperately needed. 

And so I write this with what I hope reads as sincere gratitude. It wasn't even what Bernie said, wonderful as it was, it was standing in solidarity with a group of thousands, the vast majority of whom do not look like me (I'm American of Mexican decent). The positivity, inclusivity, the enthusiasm, the collective righteous indignation, the general *wholesomeness* of the occasion and the very real sense of community already had me in a very emotional place, but when Ellen Holly went up to the podium and more than made up for her diminutive stature with her fiery, honest, and impassioned words: ""My name is Ellen Holly, I'm from Elkhorn, Wisconsin. I'm a retired educator, union member, woman of faith, grandmother of two, and I am a community organizer, activist, and educator. And I. Am. PISSED!!"" I just about lost it 😭✊🏼. Then the raucous cheers in support of women's rights, public education, labor unions, LGBTQ folks, working class families, undocumented farm workers... just amazing. I was buzzing The entire drive back home. The event gave me renewed hope. It reinvigorated my belief in the full potential of our great country. It motivated me to get even more involved.

"Why is cell service so bad in SW Wisconsin? I've been living in Madison since 2019. Last year I got a job in the Spring Green area and have been commuting. One thing I've noticed is that my phone has no service in Spring Green and doesn't reliably turn back on until I'm east of Mazomanie. But I've also noticed I generally don't get service if I go south to Dodgeville either.

I thought it was just my phone, as it's old and I'm on a budget tracfone-esque plan. Recently my phone fell onto a hard floor and cracked the screen; I looked about getting it repaired but it's genuinely so old that it's not possible. So I am looking for a new phone and considered getting a new plan that gives me service at work too, in case of emergencies.

But it seems like no cell phone networks have coverage in SW Wisconsin. Am I missing something? I understand the driftless region has some hills, but it's not like they're the rockies.

"Word of advice. I see that you are a very supportive parent. However, please do not make your son approach random faculty and students right when you visit. We love new students… but please be mindful that the time you are coming is very much exam season for most students/professors. I don’t recommend a departmental visit; again, a very busy time and it’s rather close to the time you will be visiting to make a request. 

I love that you are excited!!! It’s an exciting thing! 
Some things you could do:

Visit the physics museum at Chamberlin and just walk around. Look at the big lecture hall I think room 2104? There’s a Physics 208 lecture at 8:50 or 9:55 on Mondays and Wednesdays. You can stand outside the door and listen for a lil bit or sit in the far back if you wanted. (I wouldn’t recommend waiting to say hi to the professor(s) they are very busy). 

Your son will spend a lot of time in the chemistry building. You can walk in there, go down the big set of steps, and look around. He will most likely be taking Chem 103 or 109 first semester. They usually have lectures in S### (maybe 103? can’t remember the numbers, but the big lecture halls that you basically walk into when you go down the steps) at 8:50 or 9:55 potentially. Ochem lecture is also there sometimes, it could be a fun surprise as to which one you go to. If you do go to any lectures, go 15 minutes early and sit in the back. 

Walk lakeshore path and look at the dorm situation. Also look at the dorms downtown (Ogg, Witte, Sellery) and see if those are your vibe. You probably can’t get in and it’s not really worth trying just look at where they are within context of the chem building. Think about how much walking you want to do in the cold weather in the winter when choosing a dorm. 

He won’t be spending a ton of time (if any) in the building his major is housed in. Don’t be too worried about looking at it; there’s nothing special about the buildings. He will have pleeeenty of time to explore during Freshman first week. 

In regards to pre-health, humility and an open mind are the best things you can bring in with you. Classes will be rigorous, frustrating, thought provoking, and very rewarding. Celebrate the wins and care for the losses. Have him get his CNA, BLS certifications, and apply to UW Hospital or volunteer there during his second year (Get CNA and BLS this summer if possible). 

Let me know if you want more suggestions. Welcome to UW Madison and congratulations to your son!",reddit,downtown
"Calling your Reps is a Waste of Time, And We All Know It. Sloppy post, but something I think we need to hear:

**Calling your Reps is a waste of time.** This never really worked and we just need to stop. And it’s already likely that you intuitively understand the following reasons no rep will pay any attention to your phone call:

1. **Picking and Choosing Who to Listen To is How they Win in the First Place.**

Nobody gets elected to Federal office without polling, coalition building, and fundraising. Each rep knows how he or she got elected, and, generally, knows what’s expected of them by the apparatus that got them elected. In general, they know what that apparatus expects of them to get the same or more amount of votes, support, and funding during their next run. They won’t break from that on a phone call from a random constituent. This sounds harsh, but does it really make sense that a congressperson would make specific campaign promises, win on them, and then turn around and abandon them because of a phone call?

1. **They Might Not Represent Any Part of the Public Body**

How much work did you do, really, to get the candidate that you’re calling elected? How much did you donate? If you’re like me, you’re not in much of a position to do either of those things, and the answer to both of them is nothing. As such, you shouldn’t expect an audience. If being elected to national office was a purely social thing you could do without money or support, we’d be in a very different situation. But things being as they are, nobody gets elected without material support. Some reps, like Baldwin, make their deal with whatever devils they can and do the best they can, while some like Grothman are in a position to never have to serve his constituency.

1. **We Did This in 2016 and it Was a Failure.**

The Indivisible org started right after Trump’s first election and was very popular. One of the primary avenues for action was to ‘call your reps’. I can confirm that Indivisible Madison was putting out alerts 2-3 times a week for several months in a row. On top of being completely unsustainable for the org, it accomplished nothing. Each Rep did exactly what they were going to do in the first place. Our two friendly reps would often already be voting ‘our way’ but immovable on anything he wasn’t already going to do. Our hostile rep simply never answered the phone. The tactic of rep calling isn’t just hypothetically bad or might have drawbacks ***it was recently tested in almost identical circumstances and was proven not to work. The tactic of rep calling is directly responsible for where we are.***

1. **You’ve Always Known that Calling does Nothing, and Admitting It is Necessary to Make Progress and Stay Sane.**

The demand to call your reps is a pernicious and malevolent ask. It invites us to ignore everything that we intuitively know about the way our world is run and suggests that, gosh golly, the reason your rep voted the way they did is because they must have gotten a bunch of heartfelt calls from their constituents that let them know that another tax cut for the richest of us was, somehow, critical to their wellbeing. We are to think that, of course, our reps are always listening, and that it’s we who have failed to communicate our needs or be persuasive, but that's all just a mind game. The whole thing is designed to gaslight you, waste your time, wear you out, and direct your attention towards efforts that won’t build any power or put you in a position to demand (instead of ask for) things. If you’re the type of person that can call a senator and move them on a position, go ahead and call, but if you’re not that type of person, you should think of any time spent speaking with your rep as time not spent building an apparatus to strongarm or replace them.

**What should we do instead?**

Join an org that puts you in contact with like minded individuals who are near you, one that isn’t just telling you to call your rep. You might feel like there is no such org, but if you look around I bet you can find some group in your area that’s been fighting the good fight whether it be charity or political. You’re looking for people who are building power, are democratically run, and regularly work with those that will be directly victimized by this administration (immigrants, trans/non-binary, pregnant women, black communities, minority communities etc.). It will, almost certainly, represent a significant lead leftward for your politics. For me, it was the DSA, but there are other orgs out there. Just remember that the closer the org is to the platform of the Democratic party, the closer they are to a platform that couldn’t answer our predicament.",reddit,general madison

E.G. My parents retired to a farm just outside a small town in Calumet County. Every restaurant in town, every diner, every gas station - Newsmax on the tv or right wing radio blaring 24/7.

Between the two of us, we’ve lived in Adams, Lodi, Madison, Janesville, and Portage for the most part. He briefly lived in Sheboygan, and I did a brief stint in Green Bay when I was 18 and went to college there (dropped out). My husband refuses to live in Dane county again, so Madison and its surrounding areas are not an option. We don’t want to get too far away from our families (Adams and Lodi) because we want our daughter to still be able to see her grandparents reasonably often. So although the northern part of Wisconsin is very beautiful, or so I’m told, I think it’s too far from our families. 

I’ve always kind of wanted to live in Baraboo because of Devil’s Lake and the bluffs, but the school district is terrible. I should add that education is an important factor both for my daughter and myself, as I’m currently in the process of adding elementary licensing to my secondary teaching license.

"Wisconsin Supreme Court Election April 1st - Susan Crawford Hi all! I live and work in D.C. I plan on volunteering for Susan Crawford Campaign for Supreme Court and I just wanted to bring attention to her campaign and the election that is coming up on April 1st.

One of my personal goals for 2025 was to do organizing work again after pausing it for couple of years. The rage that I have felt these past couple of weeks is reminiscent of trump first administration, however, now I have a better understanding of what I should be doing. I can start by translating my rage to a productive work by taking action on what I know I can do.

I know there’s many people who are frustrated and want to know what they can do as an individual, and I really want to encourage everyone here to know that you are able to fight against the hostile take over of the government by elon and trump. However, we need people to come out in masses for this.

Unfortunately, the opposing candidate does have a social media presence, he has a strong following. But all that means is that more people need to know who Susan Crawford is, and social media is where her name must be pushed. Especially now, since the election is coming by fast!

Few of my other goals was to check out some national parks and go to a state I never been to, this is a great opportunity for me to explore Wisconsin, learn more about the state and the people. I’ll be there in March for a week, so if you have any suggestions of which national parks I should check out, which cities I should explore, food I should try out or any tilde of any kind please let me know!

So, actionable steps for you!

1. Marquette University School of Law will be hosting an event called:

Get to know: Wisconsin Supreme Court Candidate Susan Crawford 

Date
Friday, February 28, 2025
12:15 PM

The program will begin promptly at 12:15 p.m. and include lunch, conversation, and community in Eckstein Hall. 

(The opposing candidate is on Feb 18th, if you want to hear what his platform is from his own voice, I do encourage you to go and make your own decision on who you should vote for.)

2. Volunteer to Susan Crawford campaign!
You all know how policies impact your friends, family members, classmates, coworkers, neighbors etc. you all know how to talk to peers, you know how to discuss about different political ideas with your community, you know what is needed, you all work in organizations that focus on different missions, schools, restaurants, bars. You all are in the churches, local student groups, etc. you all are the perfect people to keep Susan Crawford name, platform on everyone’s tongue. 

Please consider organizing a hangout with your friends, local school club, or student organizations, coworkers, family members, church community etc. and volunteer to door knock, or whatever else you think would be a great way to organize people around the election. 

https://www.crawfordforwi.com

3. Volunteer or stay connected to Swing Left. This is an organization that has been sharing informational resources from 2017. If you would like more guidance to continue organizing in your federal congressional elections, or state elections please sign up to volunteer.

https://swingleft.org/p/wisconsin-supreme-court-2025?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=website

4. Follow her social media pages! We need to use social media to our advantage to share info about elections, and candidates. I am personally biased towards TikTok, so, if you have a TikTok account, or there’s an influencer you believe could bring more attention to the election please ask them to do it! If there’s podcasters you know that should platform her, send her name to them! You all are able to do resistance work right now! And showing up for her online and offline is the best way to show support as well! The social media page is on her website!

5. Pay as attention gf to your state politics! People tend to forget that state government has a much more of a direct impact on individuals than Federal government. You all, the ability to show up for your state and resist against the tyranny that is overtaking the federal government right now.

6. Tune into the Debate of the candidates Wednesday, March 12 at 7pm hosted by WISN-TV ( this should be live-streamed on TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, etc.)

Here is a call of action from a local organizer of the Democratic Party in Wisconsin! She is asking you all to join her! She’s 43 years old and the youngest during many of the meetings, we need this movement to be intergenerational and grassroots!

"What don't I know about owning land ""up north?"" My wife and I (early 30s) are homeowners around Milwaukee and love to camp, hike, fish, and hunt. I was a maintenance worker all through my 20s, and worked on the grounds crew at a golf course for a few summers/Falls as well, so I consider myself fairly handy and capable. We've always talked about buying land ""up north"" and parking a trailer on it for weekend getaways or hunting trips and eventually having a small cabin built. I've read a lot of the posts on here asking similar questions, so I understand that I need to research zoning, wetlands, building codes, access to power, water/sewer, and the upkeep involved in cabins. What I'm really looking for is information on land ownership itself and have a few questions. 

We're not farmers and don't plan to be, so if we bought land with any combination of woods, grassland, or marshland, how much work goes into that? What goes into maintaining these types of land?  Will I need to purchase any heavy machinery? Can I repurpose land used for farming, or should I avoid it (ie. a quarter of it was a cornfield)? If I purchased prime hunting land, how common is it for people to trespass? Are there realtors that specialize in looking for lots across large areas of the state instead of specific areas or counties?

Most people in the state are very outdoorsy - try all of the various flavors of outdoor activities we have to offer and find your favorites with people who share the passion. There are many low cost activities to do in friend groups. It may well be something you aren't familiar with, like kayaking, disc-golf, fishing, cycling, ""corn hole"". If you're not familiar with life in the winter, it's best to continue getting outside even when it's cold for mental and physical health. Lots of layers, good boots, and get out there on a hike or nature trail in the sun a couple of times a week at least. Clear snow completely from your car and sidewalks the day it falls. If left it will freeze and take significantly longer to clear. Bonus points if you put your windshield wipers up when snow is forecasted. Hydration is also an adjustment to a winter climate as there isn't constant heat compelling you to drink enough. The best way to meet your neighbors is actually to ask them for a little bit of help - explain you're new to the Midwest and you'll be surprised how receptive and willing people will be.

"Sleep deprived praise with small rant from an Arizona to Wisconsin Transplant Good evening to most, and good morning to some. As the title suggests I am originally from Arizona, specifically Phoenix, and moved to Wisconsin! I feel like being here for a year and a half I now have a semi-decent idea of things and wish to echo them into the void of the internet! 

For starters, I live in Southern rural Wisconsin. Going from a city of 1.6 million people to a small village of less than 2000 was such an insane change. I mean first, coming to realize that there were still places in the United States referred to as villages was a shocker. The next realization I came to grips with was the silence. I honestly never realized how loud Phoenix was, or how cramped full it was. Every day I'd drive by people and other cars and on the street and pay them no mind as though they weren't there. Here people seem to really exist and stick out. I recognize people, it feels more alive. I actually look forward to seeing people too, like the seemingly nice gentleman who waves and nods at people by the river as they drive by. 

Next I noticed how nice everyone was. Manners everywhere, small talk that seemed out of genuine interest instead of obligation. Seeing people help each other on the road, or even in the store if someone comes up a little short. Not to say those things didn't happen in Arizona, but it happened far less frequently than I think it should have given the difference in population. 

Experiencing true seasons was much different too! Majority of Phoenix was just Summer. Fall? Nope, still summer. Winter? Maybe two weeks long. Spring? Nah, less hot summer. Watching the leaves turn color after shortly after getting here filled me with awe. Of course I'd seen it in pictures but it was so different in person. When winter came, I was worried I'd hate it. Id never even seen snow in person, let alone driven in it before. However, and this loops back to my previous point, people helped me prepare with a lot of sound advice. Get snow tires, or at least all season tires. Take it slow, here's how to handle sliding, etc. And when snow finally came, I adapted to it so quickly that all my anxiety disappeared. I actually love snow! (I'm sure this will change as years go on.)

Wisconsin just gave me more and more to love, and still does. I built a life out here quickly, coming out here with almost nothing. I have a career now, one that will keep me here for 30 years for sure. But not everything can be so jolly and perfect. I can handle many things. Occasional rude people who don't keep comments to themselves about my family dynamic. Awful drivers on the Beltline in Madison. (Though, they aren't worse than Phoenix drivers at least. Not better either.) Hell I can even handle the cultural obession with alcohol despite the fact I dont drink. But I draw the line at two things....

First, the amount of bugs out here is absolutely ridiculous. I've never seen so many insects in my damn life. Why the hell are there so many and why do a third of them think I taste good. It's bullshit! 

Second, out of all the weather I've experienced here. More consistent rain, snow, blistering heat in thick humidity, hell even tornadoes...I really fucking hate dense fog. Like, who's ever idea it was to hot box Wisconsin needs to rethink their life choices! Getting home on a 30 minute drive after my second 16 hour shift in a row is strenuous as is, I dont need to add mother nature puff puff passin' on my ass to the point I can't see shit past my bumper other than the souls of the dammed! (Random lights from houses when they finally get close enough)

All in all though, I really do love Wisconsin. I love that ill be raising my children here, and likely retiring from here. Thank you if you made it this far, I am exhausted and gonna go perish for the next However long until my daughter wakes up!",reddit,general madison

"Fired While Being Gay—Help Needed I’ll try and keep this brief while giving as much information as I can. My partner was terminated earlier this month (in Wisconsin) from a position in a public sector job, a month after their workplace leadership learned of our relationship (we’re both gay). No one at their workplace knew previously of my partner’s sexual orientation, and while any non-leadership staff don’t really care, the leadership of the agency definitely care about the workplace’s image, which historically is traditional and does not like to rock the boat and show itself to be socially progressive. Also, of course no one would likely admit that the reason for the termination is based on sexual orientation, there is some evidence beyond what’s posted here to demonstrate this.

The month preceding the termination, there were some increased tensions at work, and eventually my partner was cited on a random day for poor performance at work, with several prior years’ worth of excellent work performance evaluations—so this was out of the norm. They were not given any warning, they were simply removed from their position. While my partner does admit fault for the accident at work, they note that this is unusually excessive and the disciplinary action does not fit what they did as others have done similar things and not been fired. 

The reason for this post is to seek out any law firms/attorneys that work on sexual orientation discrimination in employment, and even more specifically, if there are any that would work at a low cost. My partner is not looking to return to the hostile work environment, but rather wants to make an example of this employer and workplace. The world we live in is increasingly prejudicial towards anyone that’s not conforming to traditional values and I want to ensure my partner gets justice where justice is due. 

Any other advice/recommendations is welcome as well.",reddit,general madison

"The boogeyman George Soros The name “George Soros” is often used—especially in right-wing or conservative media—as a kind of shorthand or symbol to discredit or attack people, organizations, or movements that support liberal or progressive policies. Here's why that happens:

1. He Funds Progressive Causes

George Soros is a billionaire philanthropist who openly funds organizations that promote democracy, human rights, criminal justice reform, and progressive political agendas through his Open Society Foundations. That includes backing liberal candidates, media watchdogs, racial justice initiatives, and groups like MoveOn.org. Because of this, he's become a visible financial figure behind many causes conservatives oppose.

2. Symbol of 'Global Elitism' and Outsider Influence

Soros is sometimes portrayed as the embodiment of ""globalism"" or ""elite influence""—especially because he's a wealthy foreign-born (Hungarian-American) investor involved in international finance. Right-wing critics use his name to paint progressive policies as the result of manipulation by a powerful outsider, not genuine grassroots support.

3. Easy Scapegoat for Complex Issues

By blaming “Soros-backed” this or that (DAs, protests, media narratives, etc.), critics can avoid deeper conversations about the real reasons people support reform—such as structural inequality, systemic racism, or failures of the justice system. It simplifies the narrative: ""This isn't a legitimate movement, it's Soros-funded chaos.""

4. Anti-Semitic Dog Whistles

Though not always overt, some attacks on Soros tap into classic antisemitic tropes: the “shadowy Jewish financier” secretly controlling world events. This plays on centuries-old conspiracy theories about Jewish people manipulating politics and economics behind the scenes. It adds a dangerous layer of coded language that resonates with fringe groups.

5. Weaponizing Identity by Association

Calling someone “Soros-funded” is meant to delegitimize them by association. It's an ad hominem tactic: instead of addressing the person’s ideas or arguments, they’re accused of being a puppet of Soros, as if that alone discredits them.

In short: Soros is used as a rhetorical tool to undermine people and ideas on the left by making it sound like they’re part of a sinister, well-funded agenda—rather than sincere, values-based actors. It’s a political weapon, not a reasoned critique.

Let’s break this down using the Test of Self-Evident Truth, guided by Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness, and the Five Pillars: Universality, Self-Evidence, Moral Legitimacy, Foundational Nature, and the Negation Test.

We’ll analyze the tactic of using ""Soros"" as an attack—especially when aimed at people who challenge a right-wing agenda.


---

1. UNIVERSALITY

Is this principle or tactic one that can apply to all people, at all times, regardless of background or position?

No.
Labeling someone as “Soros-backed” only functions as an attack in a specific political and cultural context. It doesn't apply equally across ideologies (no one demonizes right-wing billionaires in quite the same way), nor does it critique ideas on their own merit. It unfairly targets people based on association, not universal truth.

Clarifying Question:
Would this same tactic be accepted if progressives dismissed conservative ideas solely by labeling them “Koch-funded” or “Musk-funded”?


---

2. SELF-EVIDENCE

Is the truth or falsity of this claim apparent without needing further proof?

No.
The claim that someone is “Soros-funded” rarely includes evidence—and even when true, it doesn't inherently discredit the person's argument or values. It's a form of insinuation, not a self-evident truth. The tactic relies on the audience's emotional reaction, not on clearly observable facts.

Clarifying Question:
Can the negative implication stand on its own, without relying on bias or conspiracy thinking?


---

3. MORAL LEGITIMACY

Is this tactic morally legitimate in the pursuit of truth, justice, or human dignity?

No.
Weaponizing someone's association with a donor—especially when used to shut down legitimate debate—is a form of intellectual dishonesty. It also perpetuates harmful stereotypes, including anti-Semitic tropes, whether intentionally or not. It violates the dignity of those targeted and undermines respectful democratic discourse.

Clarifying Question:
Does this approach respect the humanity and agency of the person it’s aimed at?


---

4. FOUNDATIONAL NATURE

Does this tactic help uphold the foundational rights to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness?

No.
Using “Soros” as a smear tactic is corrosive to free speech and open dialogue. It chills civic engagement and discourages people from participating in public discourse—especially those advocating for reform. It weakens the foundation of liberty by promoting fear, not reason.

Clarifying Question:
Does this tactic support or erode a person’s freedom to speak, believe, and participate in shaping society?


---

5. NEGATION TEST

What happens if we remove or reject this tactic—does society become more just and truthful?

Yes.
If we rejected this kind of ad hominem labeling, public conversations would have to focus more on ideas and evidence. That would strengthen democracy, protect dignity, and support rational disagreement—making society healthier and more unified.

Clarifying Question:
Would truth, liberty, and justice be better served if people stopped using smear tactics like “Soros-funded” to avoid debating substance?

SET Conclusion:

Using “Soros” as a political weapon fails the Test of Self-Evident Truth. It’s neither universal, self-evident, morally legitimate, foundational to liberty, nor beneficial when tested by its absence. It’s a divisive rhetorical shortcut that undermines respectful political discourse and should be rejected by any movement committed to truth and liberty.",reddit,general madison
"Prof Heather Cox Richardson's news summary for May 8th, all about WI. Tying in Biden's speech in Racine with the history of the Wisconsin Idea.  Professor of History at Boston College, Heather Cox Richardson, posts daily on fb and substack with a sum up of the day's news, often tying in similarities with history. It's honestly worth following to help make sense of everything that is going on. 

Here is her post for May 8th

&gt;May 8, 2024 (Wednesday)

&gt;Today, in Racine, Wisconsin, President Joe Biden announced that Microsoft is investing $3.3 billion dollars to build a new data center that will help operate one of the most powerful artificial intelligence systems in the world. It is expected to create 2,300 union construction jobs and employ 2,000 permanent workers. 

&gt;Microsoft has also partnered with Gateway Technical College to train and certify 200 students a year to fill new jobs in data and information technology. In addition, Microsoft is working with nearby high schools to train students for future jobs. 

&gt;Speaking at Gateway Technical College’s Racine campus, Biden contrasted today’s investment with that made by Trump about the same site in 2018. In that year, Trump went to Wisconsin for the “groundbreaking” of a high-tech campus he claimed would be the “eighth wonder of the world.” 

&gt;Under Republican governor Scott Walker, Wisconsin legislators approved a $3 billion subsidy and tax incentive package—ten times larger than any similar previous package in the state—to lure the Taiwan-based Foxconn electronics company. Once built, a new $10 billion campus that would focus on building large liquid-crystal display screens would bring 13,000 jobs to the area, they promised. 

&gt;Foxconn built a number of buildings, but the larger plan never materialized, even after taxpayers had been locked into contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars for upgrading roads, sewer system, electricity, and so on. When voters elected Democrat Tony Evers as governor in 2022, he dropped the tax incentives from $3 billion to $80 million, which depended on the hiring of only 1,454 workers, reflecting the corporation’s current plans. Foxconn dropped its capital investment from $10 billion to $672.8 million.  

&gt;In November 2023, Microsoft announced it was buying some of the Foxconn properties in Wisconsin.

&gt;Today, Biden noted that rather than bringing jobs to Racine, Trump’s policies meant the city lost 1,000 manufacturing jobs during his term. Wisconsin as a whole lost 83,500. “Racine was once a manufacturing boomtown,” Biden recalled, “all the way through the 1960s, powering companies—invented and manufacturing Windex…portable vacuum cleaners, and so much more, and powered by middle-class jobs.

&gt;“And then came trickle-down economics [which] cut taxes for the very wealthy and biggest corporations…. We shipped American jobs overseas because labor was cheaper. We slashed public investment in education and innovation. And the result: We hollowed out the middle class. My predecessor and his administration doubled down on that failed trickle-down economics, along with the [trail] of broken promises.” 

&gt;“But that’s not on my watch,” Biden said. “We’re determined to turn it around.” He noted that thanks to the Democrats’ policies, in the past three years, Racine has added nearly 4,000 jobs—hitting a record low unemployment rate—and Wisconsin as a whole has gained 178,000 new jobs. 

&gt;The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act have fueled “a historic boom in rebuilding our roads and bridges, developing and deploying clean energy, [and] revitalizing American manufacturing,” he said. That investment has attracted $866 billion in private-sector investment across the country, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs “building new semiconductor factories, electric vehicles and battery factories…here in America.” 

&gt;The Biden administration has been scrupulous about making sure that money from the funds appropriated to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure and manufacturing base has gone to Republican-dominated districts; indeed, Republican-dominated states have gotten the bulk of those investments. “President Biden promised to be the president of all Americans—whether you voted for him or not. And that’s what this agenda is delivering,” White House deputy chief of staff Natalie Quillian told Matt Egan of CNN in February. 

&gt;But there is, perhaps, a deeper national strategy behind that investment. Political philosophers studying the rise of authoritarianism note that strongmen rise by appealing to a population that has been dispossessed economically or otherwise. By bringing jobs back to the regions that have lost them over the past several decades and promising “the great comeback story all across…the entire country,” as he did today, Biden is striking at that sense of alienation.

&gt;“When folks see a new factory being built here in Wisconsin, people going to work making a really good wage in their hometowns, I hope they feel the pride that I feel,” Biden said. “Pride in their hometowns making a comeback.  Pride in knowing we can get big things done in America still.” 

&gt;That approach might be gaining traction. Last Friday, when Trump warned the audience of Fox 2 Detroit television that President’s Biden’s policies would cost jobs in Michigan, local host Roop Raj provided a “reality check,” noting that Michigan gained 24,000 jobs between January 2021, when Biden took office, and May 2023.

&gt;At Gateway Technical College, Biden thanked Wisconsin governor Tony Evers and Racine mayor Cory Mason, both Democrats, as well as Microsoft president Brad Smith and AFL-CIO president Liz Schuler. 

&gt;The picture of Wisconsin state officials working with business and labor leaders, at a public college established in 1911, was an image straight from the Progressive Era, when the state was the birthplace of the so-called Wisconsin Idea. In the earliest years of the twentieth century, when the country reeled under industrial monopolies and labor strikes, Wisconsin governor Robert “Fighting Bob” La Follette and his colleagues advanced the idea that professors, lawmakers, and officials should work together to provide technical expertise to enable the state to mediate a fair relationship between workers and employers. 

&gt;In his introduction to the 1912 book explaining the Wisconsin Idea, former president Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, explained that the Wisconsin Idea turned the ideas of reformers into a workable plan, then set out to put those ideas into practice. Roosevelt approvingly quoted economist Simon Patten, who maintained that the world had adequate resources to feed, clothe, and educate everyone, if only people cared to achieve that end. Quoting Patten, Roosevelt wrote: “The real idealist is a pragmatist and an economist. He demands measurable results and reaches them by means made available by economic efficiency. Only in this way is social progress possible.”

&gt;Reformers must be able to envision a better future, Roosevelt wrote, but they must also find a way to turn those ideals into reality. That involved careful study and hard work to develop the machinery to achieve their ends. 

&gt;Roosevelt compared people engaged in progressive reform to “that greatest of all democratic reformers, Abraham Lincoln.” Like Lincoln, he wrote, reformers “will be assailed on the one side by the reactionary, and on the other by that type of bubble reformer who is only anxious to go to extremes, and who always gets angry when he is asked what practical results he can show.” “[T]he true reformer,” Roosevelt wrote, “must study hard and work patiently.” 

&gt;“It is no easy matter actually to insure, instead of merely talking about, a measurable equality of opportunity for all men,” Roosevelt wrote. “It is no easy matter to make this Republic genuinely an industrial as well as a political democracy. It is no easy matter to secure justice for those who in the past have not received it, and at the same time to see that no injustice is meted out to others in the process. It is no easy matter to keep the balance level and make it evident that we have set our faces like flint against seeing this government turned into either government by a plutocracy, or government by a mob. It is no easy matter to give the public their proper control over corporations and big business, and yet to prevent abuse of that control.”

&gt;“All through the Union we need to learn the Wisconsin lesson,” Roosevelt wrote in 1912.

Racine in particular has an awful history of KKK activity and redlining. Dane County I believe has historically been better and that influences how it feels today. One of our closest friends growing up (person of color) used a proxy to buy their house in the 60’s so they weren’t subject to discrimination.

"WIED HAS GOT TO GO Gallagher was at least reasonable.  Wied is just a full on MAGA dick.  No mention of Medicaid and other cuts, just how we gotta put those lazy SNAP losers to work.

*Dear Friend,*

*This week, several committees voted to advance the House GOP’s budget reconciliation bill. This bill will provide the tools we need to enact President Trump’s agenda, cut reckless federal spending, support our farmers, secure our border, and put our country back on a sound fiscal path.*

*I was proud to participate in the House Agriculture Committee’s budget reconciliation markup this week. In our portion of the bill, we ensure that we protect our farmers, put the ""farm"" back in the Farm Bill, and ensure the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) remains viable for those truly in need by rooting out waste and abuse.*

*Currently, 82% of the Farm Bill funds entitlement programs like SNAP. It’s a bit misleading to call it a “farm bill” when such a small portion is dedicated to supporting farmers and agriculture. By strengthening work requirements for able-bodied adults, we can help lift people out of poverty while preserving the program for those who truly in need and redirecting those misused funds to agriculture programs.*

*Our budget bill will ensure we refocus and rebalance our funding to give farmers the tools they need to thrive. While the House budget reconciliation bill is not a substitute for the Farm Bill, I will support any legislation that helps Northeast Wisconsin and our farmers and agricultural industry.*

*The final bill will hopefully be brought to a vote in the next week, and it’s time we come together to pass it, enact the agenda the American people voted for, and continue Making America Great Again!*

*Thanks again for starting off your weekend with us! We hope you enjoy this week’s edition of the Wied Wire.*

"Parking Advice/Help in Downtown Madison Hi Everyone, 

I'm currently a senior at UW - Madison, graduating in a few weeks! 2 days after graduation I'm beginning a job in Verona (Yay!). My plan is to finish the summer (until August) living in my college apartment, driving into Verona from there (For a little context, my apartment is in downtown Madison near Urban Outfitters). Here's the downside: So far, to save money, I've been keeping my car at my parent's home. This means that I don't have a parking space and I don't know the first thing about parking in downtown Madison (what my options are and IF there are any options available). Does anyone have any advice? 

A little more info: The job is an executive assistant role that requires me to have a car (so there's no use giving me advice about bus routes or other modes of transport). Also, I am more than willing to pay for an expensive parking space, I just want to know what's out there. 

  
I've already called around to some lots near me and there seems to be no availability- though I've made it to one wait list. The only options I've found that ARE available is through the public parking garages- and these monthly passes are 300$. Any advice, knowledge, recommendations, etc is welcome! Please send some help my way (especially if you have an inside scoop on downtown lots with opening spaces, though I'm aware this is wishful thinking lol). 

Thanks!",reddit,downtown
"Meeting with Representative Schutt on Funding Education A week ago I met with Representative Ellen Schutt (Wisconsin District 31) to talk about [my open letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/1bl493n/open_letter_regarding_public_school_funding/). I meant to post about this earlier but not only have I been busy, but the few times I wrote this post made it clear that I need to make a video or something explaining how the school funding formula currently works and doesn't work (hopefully soon). Representative Schutt agreed the current model doesn’t work, and that the state needs to invest more in education. But, she was against ideas that were one-time bills, because it's not sustainable. Simply increasing the funding also doesn’t work, in her opinion, because the funding formula requires districts to raise a certain fraction of the school funding from property taxes. Other funding methods for the state to invest in education on a one-off basis exist where the funding formula isn’t used, but there would be concerns about the equitable distribution and again sustainability. She seems interested in looking at proposing changes to the funding formula itself, but wants input from the school districts in her district.

Another tangential topic that came up was about teacher pay, in relation to the recent Wisconsin DPI report that shows average teacher salaries in Wisconsin have fallen about 20% since 2009. She shared my concerns about teacher retention in Wisconsin districts, but pointed out that school districts set their own pay progression based on local control, and the state can’t mandate pay guidelines. I floated the idea of state minimum wages for levels of experience in teaching, but she didn’t think that would be popular with school districts or the legislature. I also floated the idea of “Pell Grant” like tuition forgiveness programs for Universities of Wisconsin and UW-Madison graduates that teach a certain number of years in the state. She seemed to like the idea, mentioning that years ago the state did something similar when the state faced a nursing shortage.

She pressed the importance of public contacting their representatives and senators as the budget and election seasons are coming upon us. And if anything is going to happen in the area of state support for education it will require the buy-in from members of the state assembly and senate. And that they do pay attention to the position and numbers of people who contact them about issues. They want to hear from us, and want to know what we think about the issues. So, if we want to improve state support for education, we need to keep reaching out, contact your representatives today - https://myvote.wi.gov/en-us/My-Elected-Officials",reddit,general madison

"I need to talk to a Medical Malpractice Attorney TLDR: I desperately need a malpractice attorney to help me with negligence resulting in complete loss of health and quality of life.

Ive tried contacting 3 or 4 and havent heard back so Im kinda desperate at this point.

My situation is really complicated but I have everything documented to show and flesh out once I find someone who will help me at least figure out if I do have a case.

For the last two years Ive been living in a nightmare. The last year has been absolutely horrible. My GP lied on my chart, refused to correct the lies, wont share names of prior studen doctors they allowed to see me and, worse, is refusing to treat me resulting in ER visits, extended, prolonged and compiled injury/illness and, worse, I've lost all quality of life.

My GP has known for over a year I have not been able to leave my bed because of pain and fatigue and has done nothing but refer me to doctors who cant help me.

My GP has tortured me with my psychology because of her personal bias both around cannabis and around my religion.

And, worse, because of my GP's lies on my chart, not even my psychologyst will help me. Everyone thinks Im seeking narcotics recreationally despite NEVER having done so in my entire life.

I have multiple skin disorders from not being able to shower more than once or twice a month, had to have a tooth ripped out of my skull and two others broken from not being able to brush my teeth and migraines from ongoing sinus issues and none of this includes the symptoms and issues from the chronic illness Im currently being tested for: Rhumatoid Arthritis.

Because of the severe degree of neglect from my GP and the lies on my chart she refuses to correct or address, I have not been treated like a human being once in the last year (including not being given sufficient pain medication after laproscopic surgery, being directly told not to go to the ER by my GP office for a tooth infection, refusal to do diagnostics as too why I was passing nothing but blood in my stool for a while, the list goes in and on and on)...

I digress, apologies. Because of all of this, I am being forced to move back home with my mom who kicked me out three years ago for not getting a job because she, too, didnt believe I was sick. This time she knows I am and is seeking help for me but is still treating me like an obligation. I have suffered trauma and abuse from her for 35 years; moving back is the LAST thing I want to do and I am TERRIFIED.

But I genuinely feel like I have no choice or am going to die. Ive wasted away this last two years waiting for my doctors to care and I know if I dont get help soon, I'mm be just another statistic.

Sorry, this ended up much linger than I intended... and still has so little information. Thank you so much for your time.",reddit,general madison

There's a grocery store just off campus called Fresh Market that used to deliver for free if you spent more than $40.

"Hi,

I responded to you when you asked about McGill vs UW-Madison a week or so ago. I'm a dual citizen and attended UofT but currently live in the Madison, WI area and have three kids that graduated from UW-Madison. I don't have much to add to that answer regarding McGill except to agree with ""thenationalcranberry"" that French is not necessary in Montreal although it will be in the rest of Quebec. 

With regard to UofT what you have heard about it is correct. I graduated from UofT years ago in the eighties and there was no school community spirit. It's downtown in a major city so students tended to use the entertainment and bar scene that the city had to offer and ignored campus offerings (drinking age is 19 in Ontario). Unlike UW-Madison students were not interested in any of the athletic teams. At the time, the UofT football team was lucky to get 200 people attending a game compared to 80,000 attending at UW-Madison. With UW-Madison the city and the university are very intertwined, the university is a very important part of the city this is not the case at UofT. In addition, Toronto is super expensive compared to Madison and even Montreal. The academic support system was not strong you were on your own but that was UofT years ago so things may have changed. 

As far as jobs go UofT will help for employment in Canada and is likely better known in the USA than McGill do to UofT's international research and academic reputation. It is often written on this forum by people responding to CS majors that the school doesn't determine your job opportunities. Sucess in a job search depends on the individual student and the effort they put into getting good grades and applying to internships. You will have an advantage over your Canadian classmates in that you can apply to US-based jobs. Study hard (good grades are a must - note that Canadian universities tend to use percentages rather than a 4.0 scale or even A, B, C grades, although they do offer a conversion scale if necessary), join clubs that are part of your major, network with professors (make sure they know you so you can get references and a chance at campus research jobs), and apply to internships starting in September when recruiting season begins and don't forget to prepare for interviews (including researching the companies you are interviewing with and participating in practice interviews). It may be difficult to get internships between freshman and sophomore year but try and plan accordingly. Definitely get internships between sophomore and junior year and most importantly between junior and senior year that might roll over into a full-time opportunity.

I can't do much about all of the federal fuckery going on (yes, I've been calling my reps, and as always, FRJ). But I *can* do something about this State Supreme Court election, and you can too. 

I volunteer with my local grassroots organization and we need people to knock on doors and canvas for Susan Crawford. There was a poll last week that showed that [58% of voters don't know enough about Crawford](https://www.wpr.org/news/poll-many-dont-know-crawford-schimel-wisconsin-supreme-court) to form an opinion about who to vote for. Knocking on doors is a great way to help share the information that voters need - plus, pounding pavement is good catharsis.

I specifically volunteer with the Southwest Milwaukee Neighborhood Action Team, but there are grassroots organizations all over the state that can use people to go knock doors. And yes, knock doors specifically - it's the most effective contact method to get out the vote.

And yeah, door-knocking can be intimidating. It was to me when I first volunteered last July during the Harris campaign. BUT it's not as scary when you get a few doors under your belt. The local organizations all work with WisDems to get targeted lists so you're generally knocking on ""friendly"" doors. Every time I've run into someone voting for the other guy, they're generally polite as long as you are too. You can bring a friend with you, or if they have enough people, you can get paired up with a veteran door-knocker to show you the ropes the first time.

If you want to come out and canvas with my group this weekend, we would love to have you. The weather looks warm-ish Saturday and a little colder Sunday, but just make sure you've got a hat and some of those gloves that let you work a touch-screen (you record data through an app on your phone).

"Please help email to the Wisconsin representatives, requesting that the displayed price for any purchased item is the final checkout price - given the potential taxes coming towards us. 
Subject: Support Transparent Pricing – Include Sales Tax in Displayed Prices

Dear [Representative’s Name],

I am writing to urge you to consider legislation requiring stores to display the final price of items, including sales tax, rather than adding it at checkout. This change would benefit consumers and businesses alike by increasing transparency and improving the shopping experience.

Right now, shoppers often face confusion and frustration when the price at checkout is higher than what was displayed on the shelf. Including tax in the listed price would ensure that customers know exactly what they owe, eliminating surprises and making budgeting easier, especially for those paying with cash.

This change would also improve the shopping experience by removing the need for customers to mentally calculate tax while browsing. It would prevent businesses from advertising misleadingly low prices that do not reflect the true cost, creating a fairer marketplace.

At checkout, transactions would be smoother and more efficient since cashiers wouldn’t have to explain price discrepancies. This approach also aligns with pricing standards in many other countries, making it easier for tourists and new residents to shop without confusion.

I strongly urge you to introduce or support legislation that ensures transparent, tax-inclusive pricing in our state. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Back story: my uncle passed away, and we have been unable to find a will. My dad is his next of kin - uncle was never married, and had no kids. Dad is his only sibling; my brother and I are the only other family. Neither my brother or I have any desire to gain financially and don’t care about any money my uncle had. My dad will be the sole heir of the estate. 

We went through paperwork and found savings and checking accounts, as well as a life insurance policy, but no other assets; no investments, stocks, bonds, etc. He didn’t have a car, didn’t own a house.

As far as debts, we haven’t found any credit cards or loans. We’ve gone through old bank statements, bills that we found, etc, and as far as we can tell, all he had for bills is MG&amp;E, cable, phone, rent, and occasional medical co-pays.

"County considers purchase of UW Fox campus Winnebago County is exploring the possibility of purchasing Outagamie County’s share of the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh Fox Cities campus for a nominal fee of $1 to convert it into multiple child care centers after classes end later this year.  

The campus is jointly owned by Outagamie and Winnebago counties and with classes set to end June 30 due to declining enrollment, both county boards have been considering options for the site's future.  

The closure has sparked community interest in preserving the campus’ assets that include the Barlow Planetarium, Communication Arts Center, University Children’s Center, Weis Earth Science Museum and Community Gardens. 

At tonight's County Board meeting, supervisors are expected to deliberate and vote on a plan for Winnebago County to take over ownership of the campus and convert it into four or five child care centers and a sick child care center.  

The proposal under former Winnebago County Executive Jon Doemel appears to be separate from he and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson’s plan to sell portions of the campus to the Menasha Joint School District to be used for child care. Outagamie County's Property Committee voted in mid-March to pause the sale of the campus and have three appraisals completed.  

The Menasha school district backed out of the plan to acquire portions of the campus to use for child care late last month after Menasha residents voiced concerns about transparency and the impact on property taxes, with preliminary estimates suggesting the campus will see annual costs of $750,000 just for heating. 

Newly elected Winnebago County Executive Gordon Hintz, who started in the position this Tuesday, said by email that he has had limited conversations with both county executives about the campus and its future, and there is a potential third party ready to step up and operate the child care center. 

Hintz said concerns over the cost of operating the campus have existed since the closure was announced a year ago, “however, I know there are interested partners that want to see existing amenities such as the Barlow Planetarium and Performing Arts Center continue with self-sustaining operations, and other potential partners that have ideas for public purpose reuse and redevelopment for other buildings and land on the 43 acres.”  

According to the resolution submitted, Winnebago County would be required to operate the campus for the benefit of the public for two years and would own it outright after that. The county could lease portions of the property to third parties for non-public use, with revenue from leasing going to fund operations and improvements.  

Winnebago County could also sell some or all the property after the closing, with surplus funds from the sale beyond documented expenditures divided between the two counties. 

“It is my understanding that the justification for, and timing of the proposal, is to reduce the complications from having two counties trying to agree on every decision made about the campus, and to avoid any suspension in the existing child care operations,” Hintz said. 

If the Winnebago County Board votes to advance the sale, Hintz would need to approve and sign the resolution before the purchase agreement goes to Outagamie County for approval.  

When asked directly about whether he supports the plan, Hintz said he has many questions and reservations since he has not been directly involved in the development and negotiation of the proposal.

"Low income housing/HUD Termination of tenancy letter I had an annual review back in March to make sure I’m still within the guidelines of qualifying for low income. I’m a single mom with two young children, and I left a bad relationship. I started getting child support 3 months before my review but I failed to report it. I told the housing specialist and she said I would have some back pay but otherwise we signed my annual agreement and she told me I was good for a year. Today I got a letter saying that I needed to move out by May 30th, 2025 for not reporting a change in income. I understand that it was apart of the HUD agreement, I’m just confused as to why the specialist didn’t bring up that I was going to be evicted at the time of setting up a payment plan. Is there anything that I can do? I can set up an appeal hearing but I’m wondering if it’s worth trying when I disobeyed the contract. If anyone has had something similar happen please share your stories! TIA",reddit,general madison

"It is very heavy on the heritage. But with that it’s also the timing. Early immigrants to the colonies and brand new US went to escape religious persecution. So it’s a very different grouping, they came and founded religious communities and even if it’s not as obvious today, a lot of their values still stuck around culturally.

But Wisconsin came along later. Got our statehood in 1848 and benefited from the massive boom of German immigration that occurred from 1840 to about the civil war. Scandinavia picked up around the same time and continued throughout the civil war and boomed at the turn of the century. These were people moving due to political instability, food shortages, what have you. A myriad of issues. But they’d come and found communities here and basically try to remake their old life. No ideological basis. Just a community of Germans, Swedes, Norwegians, Belgians, whatever. And they had people here first to coordinate and find the best spots. 

Norway for example had(has) a giant book documenting everybody that emigrated. It says where everybody went to settle down and where their family is in Norway. When you went to the US you got a copy of the book to decide where to settle, maybe find where family was when there. Pretty cool. But brought a lot more culture to things without the ideological overview.

Also for example the Best family who founded what is now Pabst Blue Ribbon. They sent some sons ahead to scout things out in the US, decided on Wisconsin and more specifically Milwaukee, then the parents came to the US and brought their brewery with them.

Why the Wisconsin brewing culture? Milwaukee. Big industrial city of immigrants who all had a culture themselves of brewing and drinking. Beer had a short shelf life (remember this is pre refrigeration ofc), so often needed to be enough population to create a boom of breweries. On top of the Chicago was super close and within reach of transporting beer before it spoiled. So Milwaukee became the heart of beer brewing in the state and country very easily from all that. 

Lastly the icing on the cake of why we top all the drunkest lists. Wisconsin consumes a lot of alcohol. But not the most. We’re in the top 10 per capita, but not by much and it’s fairly tight among the bottom half of the top 10 and back into the teens. New Hampshire tops the charts at 50% more than us. But you have all these cultures that settled Wisconsin with their drinking habits and everything without massive religious stigma. Super blue collar heritage as well. Which has resulted in everybody drinking a lot and being pretty honest about how much they drink. It’s a very deep rooted drinking culture. Whereas the rest of the country people are often trying to hide how much they drink. So all these “drunkest cities/counties/states” things use self reported stuff and Wisconsin just has no filter with it. Most people don’t want to admit they have a problem, even to themselves, so they lie numbers down. But Wisconsin culturally it’s more like bragging rights and people don’t realize or care that the number they’re reporting indicates a problem. 

Ironically this gives us a ton of data to actually work to combat alcoholism and drunk driving and everything, just need the government to actually use it and act on it. 

Wisconsin’s cultural heritage is a suuuuper fascinating subject on so many levels, really wish more people would delve into it a bit. UW-Whitewater has a fantastic course on Wisconsin History, well worth an audit if anybody is interested. It’s exceptionally well done and the professor really knows his stuff.

"Aspiring Farmer with no land [Wisconsin farmland sees biggest jump in equalized value in Department of Revenue report] I and my family are looking for farmland. We want to be in the south-central part of the state close to the market we want to be in, Madison. Madison has a lot of farm-to-table restaurants as well as the Willy Street Co-Op and Conscious Carnivore. I am sure there are other good areas to be in but right now our planning is primarily centered here. You may or may not know that farmland is going for a lot higher today than it was ten years ago. Despite ""No one wants to farm anymore"" it is really a lot harder to get into farming today than it was 55 years ago when my Grandfather moved the family up from Chicago and started farming. I wish I had been in a position to take over the farm when he died but I was deploying to Afghanistan with the Army. Now I'm ready and I can't figure out how I'm supposed to get started. Now For my question, if you were a landowner and you got a cold call letter in the mail from me and my family, a veteran and aspiring farmer, would you consider selling your land for less than you could get from developers? We had a dinner with someone who knows a lot about real estate, and that was the best suggestion they had. What do you think?

  
Before anyone can say, go somewhere else: I hear you and that may be what we do but we have family here and with our dream, we hope to do a lot of things, such as opening up the first Pizza Farm in the area (that is open weekly) and to be able to host retreats for disabled veterans.

"Living in Eau Claire, or Milwaukee? Minnesotan here, I'm planning to do a year of community college (get generals out of the way), then do the rest of my bachelor's degree in biology at a university. This is to save some money in the long run, as It's likely I end up going into graduate studies for a master's.

I'm considering heading to a university in Wisconsin, and the two options on my mind right now are Eau Claire or the University of Milwaukee, as per a commented suggestion on my last post in this subreddit. 

The comment suggested Milwaukee, as quoted:   
  
""I doubt much has changed at UWEC. There were only two major groups there with those being heavy drinkers or super Jesus freaks. I would select a third option. For me, I got my Master's at UW-Milwaukee and I wished I earned my undergraduate there as well. Coming from Minnesota, it would be easier for you to hop onto a train. It has smaller class sizes similar to UWEC, but the campus is close to downtown Milwaukee for that big city atmosphere.""

Now while I do like the idea of more opportunities in a bigger city, an easier way to get there, and similar smaller class sizes, I looked up the school. Initially, it appeared the graduation rate was 45% versus Eau Claire's 77% but looking at it on USnews college rankings, those numbers have dropped- Milwaukee down to 29%, Eau Claire down to 44%.

So, should I still consider Milwaukee? Or is there more to Eau Claire then meets the eye, with stuff I'd enjoy as an extrovert who likes movies (emphasis on horror), video games, and karate?",reddit,downtown

"Many people are scared, and with good reason. I'm scared, too. I've been torn, personally and professionally, in many different directions in the last few months, listening to those fears and trying to direct folks to where they can help. Right now, Trump et al are targeting already marginalized communities. Our willingness and capacity to push back on those attacks will define how many more come in the future. So my plea to you would be to help out the work that is already being done. I could tie several issues (mass deportation, etc) back to ""the economy in Wisconsin"". but the best argument here is not an economic one in your immediate self-interest, but because it's the right thing to do to look out for others. Reach out to The Milwaukee Turners, Voces de la Frontera, FAIR, MAARPR, or any one of scores more organizations who are involved and ask how you can help. 

  
I will say, for what it's worth, that this is a backlash, not a persistent direction that our country is headed in. That's not to minimize anyone's very real fear, or the massive amount of harm that people will experience these next four years and beyond, but I've been inspired and made more hopeful by the many folks wanting to help and looking for ways to do so. Gathering folks around us and getting through together is the best and only way to do this.

And after this swings the other way? Hold us accountable, please. 

I helped to organize a training this morning for restaurant and retail business owners who want to protect their employees, including from mass deportation. And that training focused on immediate help for folks who were immediately afraid of being rounded up and send off, and how horrific is is that ICE can now violate the old concept of ""sanctuary"" - of not entering churches, schools and hospitals. But what I closed with was this: we have known for years that ICE not doing that was a policy, not a law. And the Dems, in power federally, could have codified the concept of sanctuary into law whenever they wanted to. But they didn't, because immigration isn't a ""winning issue"" for them. As a result, we'll see thousands more families ripped apart over the coming years that could have been defended and kept together. And this is the same for so many issues, from regressive taxes to abortion rights.

I'm grateful for the work that so many folks are engaged in locally but ashamed that it falls to us instead of the folks at the federal level who have had power in the past and failed to wield it to defend marginalized communities.

Sorry; that was longer than I intended, but I wanted to zoom out a little.",reddit,general madison

"Wisconsin Republicans Hit Their Vote Target, but Democrats Blew Past Theirs When we turn out, we win.

&gt;  
Again and again, Republicans repeated their goal for the Wisconsin Supreme Court election on Tuesday: Get more than 60 percent of President Trump’s voters to back Judge Brad Schimel, the conservative candidate, and they would win, flipping the court’s majority back to the right.  
  
Judge Schimel hit his mark: He won 62 percent of Mr. Trump’s November total in the state. He drew more votes even than Justice Janet Protasiewicz had received in Wisconsin’s 2023 contest for the court, when she delivered an 11-point thumping to the conservative candidate. That was the last judicial race that Democrats had turned into a national cause.  
  
The problem for Republicans this time was that Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate on Tuesday, won 78 percent of Vice President Kamala Harris’s vote total in Wisconsin — an astonishing figure for a spring election in an off year, and one that made a mockery of the bar the G.O.P. had set for itself.

There are many truths to some of OPs statements, but it’s like that everywhere in the country, not just WI. Economic hardup small communities where drugs are prevalent (but not openly discussed) and commuting 40+ minutes for a semi-livable wage job, healthcare, and any social entertainment beyond bars where everyone knows your name and life story because of a mindset of “it costs less to live here” or a fear of living anywhere else since their kin is all around them.

Also why does south park need to be torn down anyways? And why is OSAD just figuring out the FAA rules even though they have been in place for Whittman airport since at latest when  Carl Treager was built.

This is petty of me but I'm still pissed about them cutting down the old oak trees on the site they were between 400 and 600 years old and they couldn't be bothered to plan around them? Really? Also why tear down Merrill there was nothing wrong with that building and they could've turned it into housing like Smith or Dale, but no they needed to put in green space they they had just decided to get rid of (that most likely won't be allowed to be used by the students during school hours as we weren't allowed to cross the street in middle school except for gym but that might have changed).

"There are some gorgeous Victorian houses in places like Stoughton, Oregon, Verona, and Middleton, all in Dane County.  A little further out, Mazomanie or Sauk Prairie.

"Heads up on Spot Bar in Durand, WI Hey all, just wanted to drop in and share a pretty shitty experience I had this weekend while exploring the back roads of the beautiful driftless. I'm from Minneapolis and was camping in Durand, WI and went to a little place called Spot Bar. 

I walked in and the whole bar was going off on how the new Minnesota flag is actually the somali flag, and that if Kamala wins they'll be forced to shut down the bar because the town will be flooded with illegals, and how whites are being replaced. Almost left when an older hippie woman asked if I want to smoke some weed outside. Beers are cheap, the night was clear and I had nothing else to do since I was traveling alone. We went out on the deck and talked about life and such. The owner (Durand city council president, Travis) came out occasionally for some smoke breaks and picked up on who I was (where I'm from, my general political leaning) but would always kinda leave us be. Thought I was safe until he came out here and started screaming at me about how **his** taxpayer money went to George Floyd's family and rebuilding Minneapolis, it didn't and I just let him know that what he was saying just wasn't true. He was telling me how George Floyd deserved to be killed for being a drug addict. That's the police were doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and how Tim Walz let the city burn. He went off on how I'm a stupid lib that knows nothing about how the world works and that he knows more than me and is way more well rounded. Eventually after being called a piece of shit a few times among other names he told me to watch 'The Fall of Minneapolis', which I said was propoganda pushed by the wife of the former police union representative who was forced out for being a known racist pos. After that he told me to get the fuck off his property.  First time I've ever been kicked out of a bar :)

It was actually pretty scary. I generally just let these guys talk and go off and kinda nod and blend in. I love bars and towns in small town Wisconsin and understand the folks generally don't agree with me. I don't pick fights unless they're so blatantly false or directed at my city in which I'm pretty proud of. My politics is based in morals and common sense, and these guys just wanted nothing but vitriol hate. They think their way of life in DURAND FUCKING WISCONSIN is under threat from people they've never met before. This election cycle has people really heated, and I just want folks to stay safe out there. The hippie woman I was with was pretty taken aback. She was telling me how earlier this week she was encouraged not to vote since she doesn't know enough about politics :( 

TLDR; kicked out of a bar for disagreeing with the owner about the state murdering a man without due process. Stay safe around folks who disagree with you when traveling. It's worse now that it was in the past.",reddit,general madison

"Making a Documentary About Wisconsin’s Drinking Culture — Looking for Stories, Memories, and Input Hey folks,

I’m a filmmaker (and relatively new Wisconsinite) working on a documentary exploring Wisconsin’s deep and complex relationship with alcohol—past and present. The idea was sparked by [that map](https://intoxistates.com/) showing county-level rates of excessive drinking. I was intrigued at how much Wisconsin stood out, and it led me down a rabbit hole of history, culture, policy, and personal stories.

I’m looking to connect with people who have something to share—personal anecdotes, old stories, family traditions, small-town rituals, bar culture quirks, Supper Club lore, whatever. Whether it’s funny, dark, surprising, or just very “Wisconsin,” I’m interested.

Some themes I’m exploring:

* Generational drinking norms
* DIY bar spaces (barns, garages, basements)
* Interactions with law enforcement
* Local efforts at moderation or reform
* Anything that reflects what drinking *means* here

Feel free to comment or DM me if you have a story—or if you know someone who does and might be open to talking. 

Thanks, and cheers!",reddit,general madison

"Need recommendations for a psychiatrist that will actually listen and support me My psychiatrist has left the practice which is probably for the best as he never really knew me, made a lot of assumptions about me, and totally screwed over my life with how he reported me to my insurance company. 

I have tried to find a new one, but I have called so many and I'm so completely drained from fighting the insurance companies and my doctor and trying to live life while I can barely function. 

I have Quartz insurance, so I think as long as we are both in Wisconsin, if they accept Quartz and do telehealth, I could technically ""go"" anywhere. 

I need a psychiatrist that would help support my disability case (against an insurance company and social security). I have been completely out of income for a year. I cannot function. I had been doing Spravato (ketamine therapy for treatment resistant depression) but I was having really severe symptoms which caused me greater anxiety and aggravated my agoraphobia and suicidal ideation even more. 

I am thoroughly broken, on a path to healing, but I cannot hold a job. I am not hirable material. I can barely force myself to shower. I can't brush my hair. I cannot tell you the last time I brushed my teeth. I eat crap out of a bag because I have nothing left to give to make myself any sort of decent meal. I have to have my groceries and food delivered because I can barely make it out of my driveway without a panic attack. My body is on high alert every minute of every day and people judge my responses as ridiculous when I get started ( I scream and/or gasp and/or jump and/or throw whatever is in my hand and/or kick out, etc.)

I am so tired and exhausted and I just need someone on my side so I don't have to keep fighting these companies by myself. 

So do you know of a supportive, caring, will-fight-for-you kind of psychiatrist in Wisconsin that is taking new patient, accepts Quartz, and believes in helping their patients get on disability so they can continue to try and heal their trauma so it stops following them across employers? 

Or if you know a lawyer that wants to help with cases like this?

"Seriously fuck Walgreens. The only reason I used Walgreens is because they are moderately better than CVS. 

I'm a diabetic and Walgreens is constantly having issues with getting insulin. I understand there was a shortage in April, but it is now August (at the time I switched it was July). 

I had my prescription on auto refill. I got a text saying it couldn't be filled and wouldn't be until the first week of May (that's a problem because insulin is necessary for life). I spend a few hours talking to insurance, my endocrinologist, and pharmacy trying to figure out an alternative that is available. I end up having to go to a different Walgreens location to get my new prescription. When I arrive they ask which insulin prescription they are filling because insurance only covers one. I was confused because the other Walgreens said no other Walgreens in the area had any of my original prescription in stock. A Walgreens 3 miles away did in fact have my insulin. I spent 4-5 hours of my day trying to figure out how to get insulin when a 15 minute drive was all it would take. 

The next month I get the same text and have to drive to another Walgreens on the far west side of Madison. 

Then in June I get a text saying my prescription is filled and ready for pickup. I go to the pharmacy and they only have my CGMs but not my insulin or other prescription. They tell me that my prescription for insulin is at the west side location. They for whatever reason split my 3 prescriptions between the 3 different Walgreens I have had to use in the last 3 months. My 'home' location was less than 1/2 mile away the others were 15-30 minute drives. I never asked for that, it was done automatically. 

I call UW and see if their local pharmacy can fill my scripts. They can and it's closer than the other Walgreens locations. I sent all my scripts to UW and got the rest filled there. In July I go to UW and my insurance denied my scripts at UW. Why? Because Walgreens auto filled. The previous month I had asked for all scripts to be moved to UW and for auto fill to be stopped. I received no texts about my autofills in July. I again told them I no longer wish to use their pharmacy and to stop autofills. On monday I went to get my scripts filled at UW and again insurance denied it because Walgreens auto filled. 

Walgreens can't seem to keep prescriptions in stock and they send you all over their market area to fill them. When you tell them you are no longer using their services they continue to inconvenience you by still filling your prescriptions. 

CVS is worse though. On numerous occasions I received texts about scripts that aren't mine ready to be filled. On numerous occasions I had to call my insurance because they filled my prescription and gave them to someone else (again I'm diabetic it's insulin, not a narcotic). I can only assume others have received texts for my prescriptions from them. Your information is not secure with CVS. I am just waiting for the headline that says they got slapped with a huge fine for HIPAA violations. For the 2 years I had to use CVS I think maybe 3 times they did a full fill, I was constantly getting partial fills and having to return to the pharmacy. 

UW pharmacies are great if you have one nearby. They communicate with your doctor and insurance which saves you a ton of time, they understand the insurance system better and are able to advise on proper codes, and they know how to manage inventory. The only downside is their hours.",reddit,west side

"6 Billionaire Fortunes Bankrolling Project 2025 - Two From Wisconsin [https://www.desmog.com/2024/08/14/project-2025-billionaire-donor-heritage-foundation-donald-trump-jd-vance-charles-koch-peter-coors/](https://www.desmog.com/2024/08/14/project-2025-billionaire-donor-heritage-foundation-donald-trump-jd-vance-charles-koch-peter-coors/)

  
*More than $120 million from a few ultra-wealthy families has powered the Heritage Foundation and other groups that created the plan to remake American government.*

  
Since 2020, donor networks linked to just six family fortunes have funneled more than $120 million into Project 2025 advisory groups, a DeSmog analysis has found. 



More than 100 nonprofits led by the [Heritage Foundation](https://www.desmog.com/heritage-foundation/), a right-wing think tank that has engaged in climate change denial and obstruction for decades, have signed on as advisors to the Project 2025’s 900-page [“Mandate for Leadership”](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf) document — a plan to rapidly “reform,” or radically alter, the U.S. government by shuttering bureaus and offices, overturning regulations, and replacing thousands of public sector employees with hand-picked political allies. 



...

  
Many of the organizations the six families funded also have close ties to Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, DeSmog found. Trump has [repeatedly](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html) denied [involvement in or knowledge](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/us/politics/project-2025-vance-trump.html) of Project 2025, though that position conflicts with [a growing number](https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-project-2025-secret-training-videos-trump-election) of [news reports](https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-project-2025-secret-training-videos-trump-election) — a disavowal made more awkward by the fact that [Vance wrote the foreword](https://newrepublic.com/article/184651/voters-right-know-kevin-robertss-disturbing-book-says-j-d-vance-project-2025) to *Dawn’s Early Light*, a forthcoming book by Heritage Foundation president Kevin D. Roberts that describes his Project 2025 vision. DeSmog’s review of Project 2025’s financial backers found additional links to Trump, Vance, and key figures in their orbit that had not been previously known. 



These six donor networks, linked to the family fortunes of a handful of wealthy industrialists, have spent years working to loosen environmental regulations and promote climate change denial. Though Heritage describes Project 2025 as a mainstream effort to “return government to the people,” its funding sources suggest something far less populist: a vehicle for the obsessions of ultra-rich donors on the far-right fringe, pushing an agenda to reshape American democracy and overturn regulations needed to maintain a livable climate.

  
...

**Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein**

**At least $13 million to Project 2025 groups since 2020**



The Uihleins are co-founders of Uline, a company that sells shipping and packing supplies — including its ubiquitous brand of cardboard boxes — and other bulk business goods. They donate heavily to conservative causes through the Ed Uihlein Foundation, named after Richard’s father, a packaging company entrepreneur whose grandfather was an original founder of the Schlitz beer company. 



Among its donations to 13 different Project 2025 groups since 2020, Uihlein’s largest grants went to the Foundation for Government Accountability ($6.6 million), a limited-government think tank that has [railed against](https://thefga.org/blog/biden-radical-climate-agenda-states-fight-back/) “the Biden administration’s radical climate agenda,” and the American Cornerstone Institute ($2.5 million), founded by neurosurgeon and former Trump cabinet member Dr. Ben Carson. Carson has called climate change [“irrelevant”](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ben-carson-believe-candidate-stands-10-issues) as recently as 2015. 



Outside the nonprofit sphere, the Uihleins are major donors to the Trump campaign. An analysis of Federal Election Commission data showed that the couple donated $10 million to Make America Great Again, Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC, in May 2024.

# The Bradley Family 

# At least $52.9 million to Project 2025 groups since 2020 



The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation was originally established in 1942 by brothers Lynde and Harry Bradley, founders of the Allen-Bradley company, which made its fortune manufacturing a wide range of electronic products. Their descendants have continued to financially support the foundation for years to come, including with [a reported $200 million gift](https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2016/10/10/michael-grebe-bradley-foundation-conservatives-trump/) in 2015. 



But it was Michael W. Grebe, who served as CEO of the foundation between 2002 and 2016, who cemented its reputation as a conservative powerhouse, [steering donations](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/bradley-foundations-grebe-to-leave-philanthropy-but-not-politics/) to a network of activist organizations like The Heritage Foundation, the [Mackinac Center for Public Policy](https://www.desmog.com/mackinac-center-public-policy/), and the Heartland Institute (all Project 2025 coalition partners). The current chairman is [James Arthur “Art” Pope](https://www.desmog.com/art-pope/), CEO of the North Carolina grocery chain Variety Wholesalers, a longtime Koch ally.

Subject: Wisconsin Families Need Relief — Address the Rising Cost of Living

Dear [Representative’s Name],

I am reaching out to express deep concern over the rising cost of living in our state and across the country. From groceries and gas to housing and utilities, working families are being pushed to the brink.

Many Wisconsinites are working harder than ever, yet falling further behind. I urge you to support and advance policies that provide immediate relief, including measures to cap essential costs, raise wages, and protect vital services.

Our communities cannot afford political inaction. We need leadership that listens, understands, and takes meaningful action. Please stand up for the financial stability and dignity of your constituents.

Dear [Representative’s Name],

I’m writing as a constituent who believes every Wisconsinite deserves access to affordable, high-quality healthcare. Too many of us are being priced out of care, facing medical debt, or struggling to access basic services.

It’s unacceptable that in one of the wealthiest nations on earth, people still have to choose between medicine and groceries. I urge you to fight for healthcare reform that puts patients over profits, expands access, and protects critical programs like BadgerCare and Medicare.

Your leadership is needed now more than ever to make healthcare a right, not a privilege.

As your constituent, I am asking you to address the growing concerns around public safety with thoughtful, community-driven solutions. Every person in Wisconsin deserves to feel safe—whether in schools, on streets, or in their own homes.

We need strategies that focus on prevention, accountability, and equitable investment—not just reactionary measures. This includes funding mental health support, improving emergency response systems, and addressing the root causes of crime.

Please put the safety and well-being of all Wisconsinites above partisan politics.

We need you to fight for fair funding, protect public schools from harmful privatization, and ensure every child has access to a safe, inclusive, and high-quality education.

Wisconsin’s future depends on what we do today for our students and teachers. Please stand up for education that empowers, uplifts, and prepares the next generation.

We are already seeing the impact of climate change and environmental neglect. It’s your responsibility to prioritize clean energy, safeguard public lands, and hold polluters accountable.

I am plant-based and a health nut. If I do not pack and bring my own food on a work trip or road trip, there is almost nothing I can eat at most stop-and-shop style places in Wisconsin. 

Accessibility to fresh foods in food deserts and a surprising amount of little Wisconsin towns is incredibly low. I’ve been to Piggly Wiggly locations that have a piss-poor produce section, and what they do have looks off. That’s it for the town grocery store.

"We don’t have plentiful public transportation like you do so staying in Milwaukee proper may be your only option to use the bus system. There are busses that leave the city but most are run by counties and don’t work well together, nor is there a universal system for planning trips on them. Your system in the UK has always been my favorite compared to the few European countries I’ve visited. 

That being said, yes - go to a big box and walk around. It’s a cultural experience in and of itself. I just got back from Netherlands and loved my trips to the grocery store to see how different things were. 

Bring YOUR sunscreen as what you get in America is subpar. Seriously. I import mine from Europe because your UV filters are better. 

If you can get out of Milwaukee, the vast size of our state will shock you. Driving north or west 30 miles will take you to rural areas that look very different than proper Milwaukee. We are a beautiful state, and I’ve lived in several 😉

The Milwaukee Public Museum has a cool “Streets of Milwaukee” exhibit that could be of interest because it talks about the city’s history. We are a very young country and state compared to you so you might find that interesting. They also have a Native American exhibit - the true OG Americans. 

Milwaukee is on a longitude/latitude grid system that is unique to this country. I had never seen it elsewhere and I’ve lived in 11 states, traveled to at least 20 more. This isn’t the norm outside Milwaukee. Some businesses and homes have addresses like N62W10933 Smith Drive. That’s not a US thing, it’s absolutely a Milwaukee thing! 

Milwaukee is “Midwest” and you will find that many (not all, but many) are “Midwest Nice” and want to help you find your way, offer a recommendation, or just say hi. 

We have a couple universities and colleges in Milwaukee - the best example of America would be University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. Try to get up there and walk around. There won’t be as many students during a summer session but seeing how spread out it is, and how young it is - kind of cool, IMO. 

Definitely get custard (ice cream) and cheese curds. Our beef is different than yours (just trust me) but our other primary meat is chicken. You won’t see much beyond chicken, beef, fish on menus. Even McDonald’s will be different!

"Wisconsin is first in nation approved to give families extra food benefits in summer [https://www.wbay.com/2024/03/28/wisconsin-is-first-state-approved-give-families-extra-food-benefits-summer/](https://www.wbay.com/2024/03/28/wisconsin-is-first-state-approved-give-families-extra-food-benefits-summer/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Wisconsin is the first state to get approved for a program giving low-income families extra money to feed their kids over the summer, when children are no longer benefiting from school breakfasts and lunches.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Wisconsin’s Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) program.  
&gt;  
&gt;Eligible families will receive $120 for each school-age child.  
&gt;  
&gt;Benefits will be distributed in late June.  
&gt;  
&gt;Families with QUEST or Pandemic EBT (P-EBT) cards will see the funds automatically added to their cards. Other families will receive a pre-loaded debit card in the mail.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most families will receive the benefits automatically if they participate in other programs, such as free or reduced-price meals at schools, QUEST and FoodShare. The cards can be used anywhere that accepts FoodShare benefits, including grocery and convenience stores and some farmers markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;You’ll know if your family is enrolled in Summer EBT when you get a letter in the mail explaining the program and the benefits you’ll be receiving.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Making sure our kids have enough to eat is critical for supporting their success in and out of the classroom. Unfortunately, when school is out, many families lose access to one of their most reliable sources of healthy meals,” Gov. Evers wrote in a statement Thursday. “This program will be a tremendous asset in helping ensure families can afford quality, nutritious food to fill these gaps, and I am proud of the hard work of our agencies and our administration’s leadership in getting these dollars out the door and into the hands of families who need them as soon as possible.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The Summer EBT program, created by Congress, is based on similar efforts to address food insecurity for kids during the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;The state departments of Health Services, Public Instruction and Children and Families (DCF) are coordinating to get the funds to families.  
&gt;  
&gt;More information about the program can be found on the [**Wisconsin Department of Health Services website**](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/forwardhealth/summerebt.htm).

"Chili with “cut spaghetti”—just us, or a WI thing? My grandma from Waupaca County always made chili with very thin, long macaroni in it that was sold as “cut spaghetti” by Creamette. It’s not the same as fideos—it has a hole in the middle so it’s definitely macaroni, not spaghetti. No other brand makes this as far as I can tell and I’ve NEVER seen it in a grocery store outside the Midwest (maybe not even NE Wisconsin, but I’m less sure about that). And her chili had celery in it which was my favorite part as a kid! Did anyone else’s family make chili like this or is it just an “us” thing?",reddit,general madison

"Inhalers should be affordable and available OTC. They frequently don’t have as many doses as they should or are defective and stop working long before they should be out. I have mine for post-covid/allergy issues and after my albuterol inhaler ran out with supposedly 80 puffs left and I was scared I was going to suffocate overnight until I could call my doc and pharmacy in the morning to get a new one asap, I always have to make sure I have a backup and luckily with my insurance it’s only $20 a pop. 

There’s countless people with asthma and allergies and other respiratory issues that need inhalers and since they are so unreliable, we need better accessibility as well as affordability. People will literally die like this poor man without it, it’s like charging thousands for insulin that diabetics will die without it.

"First Awards Announced for WisDOT's Wisconsin Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (WEVI) Program The first round of locations for Wisconsin's allocation of NEVI funds for corridor EV charging has been selected. They are planned for installation beginning late 2024 or early 2025.

[Map of the new WEVI locations](https://preview.redd.it/j3dp2a00rd2d1.png?width=1051&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95196fb56459b18d6d43c80f7d89eb8e69ab430b)

[Map PDF available here](https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/projects/multimodal/WEVI-round1-RFP-awarded-locations-map.pdf).

They also created [a table of all of the locations](https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/projects/multimodal/WEVI-round1-RFP-awarded-locations.pdf) if you want to check out specific addresses.

And, of course, [there's a FAQ](https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/projects/multimodal/WEVI-round1-RFP-awarded-locations-FAQ.pdf).

From the email:

&gt;WisDOT has announced the first round of awards for the Wisconsin Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (WEVI) Program, expanding Wisconsin's statewide electric vehicle charging network through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. WisDOT received more than 260 applications in response to the Round 1 Request for Proposal (RFP) for candidate electric vehicle charging sites. Following the review process, WisDOT is awarding NEVI funds for charging stations installed at 53 sites along the state's Alternative Fuels Corridors (AFCs). The new fast charging stations will join five preexisting federally NEVI-compliant charging stations in Wisconsin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Installation of initial charging stations is expected to begin in late fall of 2024 or early 2025. Most WEVI Round 1 charging stations will be built at gas stations, convenience stores, and retail stores. However, some will be built at hotels and restaurants. A map and a complete list of awarded sites are on the "" Round 1 WEVI Awarded Locations"" tab on the [WisDOT Electrification Webpage](https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/projects/multimodal/electrification.aspx).  
&gt;  
&gt;A total of 15 locations selected through Round 1 are in disadvantaged communities, with two awarded to Tribal applicants. As of May 22, 2024, Wisconsin is the first and only state to award funds to a Tribal organization. Forty-six of the 53 WEVI Round 1 site locations will include North American Charging Standard (NACS) connectors. While site applicants were not required to incorporate NACS adapters in their site plans, NACS and futureproofing were among the additional considerations afforded proposals. Applicants were welcome to include plans for NACS adapters and the minimum NEVI requirements in their application.  
&gt;  
&gt;WisDOT anticipates releasing a second WEVI RFP. The date for that release has yet to be determined.

"Trouble with small town bars. We live in what I would consider a small town. Less than 2,000 people, nearest Walmart is about a half hour away. We have a grocery store the next town over, about 20 minutes round trip (grossly over priced), but it also has McDonald’s, Subway, Culver’s, etc. I’m sure you know the type.

Now normally we would order take out from a local place (aka bar, that’s all there is). Burgers, pizza, etc. a lot of times it’s cheaper (not by much) and supports local.

However, lately I’m finding they either don’t have the right staff (which is hard to find) or they simply don’t care. Orders come out wrong or unreasonably slow. If you dare to go out, some advertise “patio seating” but nobody actually to work the patio. (Serve yourself from inside)

The people I know who voted Trump or didn't vote at all break out into 2 rough groups.  Those who have been lost to reason and went full MAGA and those who like what the Democrats were saying, but they liked cheaper eggs and bringing costs down more.

People will literally always act in what they think is their own best interest.  Doesn't mean they're right, but it least it makes them predictable.  What's your prediction for how this hypothetical person will act?  They're struggling to make it pay check to pay check, everything is 20% more expensive than it was, they only got 6% in pay increases over the same period, don't pay a lot of attention to news, and just want life to get more comfortable.  They hear 2 messages when they get to vote.  ""The economy is awesome. We've done well!

There is no magic bullet. There isn't one thing they can say, but they can get closer to their voters.  They can go back to their roots with blue-collar workers, they can start genuine community outreach.  They're hard things to do, but they got complacent, and catching up is going to take more communication with voters than an occasional flyer and a bunch of fundraising emails.

Focusing entirely on things like trans rights, abortion, and gun control worked and worked well, when people weren't struggling with paying for groceries.  That's not what people care about when feeding their kids is a question.  That's not what people care about when a house costs half a million dollars and interest rates are 7 or 8 percent.  Tell people how you're going to tackle grocery costs, tell people what you're going to do about the housing crisis, of course talk about the other things too, but focus on what your voters pool is also focusing on.

If we hit unemployment rates around 6-8% in 2026, it'll be a bloodbath for Republicans.

If it hits 14% and rising, things will probably get very ugly very quickly. Especially if people start losing their homes. There's a lot of prominent people who are currently bragging about how they're making it happen. Unemployment was at 14% when the George Floyd protests were kicking off and that meant a LOT of (predominantly younger) people with quite literally nothing to do. People aren't going to 'rise up' as long as they have housing, food on the table, and something to keep them distracted when they're not working (TV, movies, video games, books, drugs, porn, etc.).

There are a few ok bakeries but I had al to more pumpernickel when I was younger than I have had in recent years. The beer tradition is strong here - and Oktoberfest is widely celebrated. It is not too hard to find a great pretzel to have with your beer. And we even have a local public television that has a program dedicated to Polka (called ""Lets Polka!"").

In our family, the old world traditions mostly came out during holidays. Christmas, specifically. We still sing ""O Tannenbaum"" at Christmas time. And had ""special"" foods at that time. Christmas markets are making a come-back recently

And it is not uncommon to hear ""wanna beer"" when walking into the home of a family with German roots. But you probably wont notice too many German beers unless your looking for them.",reddit,general madison

"May as well hit State Street. You can take the kids to the Madison Children's Museum which will be super fun for them. It's right next to the State Capital building which you'll get a nice view of. Afterwards, you can head to a great ice cream place nearby called the Chocolate Shoppe which has some awesome flavors. 

If you have time, walk to the end of State Street and you'll get onto the beginning of campus. It's about a 15 minute walk with a bunch of shops and restaurants. Walk to Park Street and you'll see the foot of iconic Bascom Hill. Hang a right and walk to the Memorial Union. Behind the building is the best hangout spot on campus, tables and chairs overlooking Lake Mendota. I highly suggest grabbing a Spotted Cow from the Rathskeller just inside the building and hanging outside just enjoying the scenery.

"I've had plenty of time to think about it, and ultimately it became very easy to reason with when I broke it down.

1. NCAA tried to fight tooth and nail against the inevitable tide of NIL even when the writing was on the wall.

2. So much so that they had literally no plan in place to adapt to a new landscape when they inevitably lost their court cases.

3. The school didn't either and are adapting at different paces in the NIL Wild West. Some are overspending and some are underspending,  and they all are still figuring out the best way to structure these efforts in a way that doesn't explode their entire program.

4. Instead of blaming the league and schools for not establishing any sort of rules framework for this obvious outcome, the fans are lashing out in hopelessness at the players themselves for betraying some antiquated sense of loyalty to a program. Which is delusional since a majority of us have no loyalty to bosses that don't pay us a market rate. Doubly so if we didn't know if our career will be over in a year.

For now I'm just compartmentalizing my own emotional reaction to this new landscape. The sport as we knew it is completely changed, but this is not the final form. It is just the current, incredibly flawed form that exists because of the NCAA's ""just bury our heads in the sand"" strategy for decades. I would expect that in a few years, this NIL $$$ arms race is going to run its course. Boosters aren't going to be funding that kind of shit year after year for years on end--the schools are the one's profiting from it, not these 'loyal' investors. Before too long they will realize that shelling out 7 figures for an above average player like Chucky (made the B1G all-defensive team but still didn't even crack the general all-conference teams) simply doesn't give them the return on their investment that they expect. You can't buy championships that easily. Yes he's a good piece for any team, but a million dollar piece for one year? Ehhh.

One thing to note is that according to some insiders, UW's NIL numbers are competitive with the rest of the big programs when it comes to what they make while on campus. Rather, they don't have the bankroll to throw that kind of money around when it comes to attracting transfers or to keep their own players from shopping around--ie signing bonuses. I bring this up because, like I said earlier, I doubt collectives will be willing to shell out that kind of money for one year non-star transfers for too much longer (granted more so for football than basketball in the grand scheme of things). There will eventually be a reckoning between the numbers and results, and *possibly, maaaaybe* even some rules and regulations put into place to establish a common framework for the entire league so it's not all just insane behind-closed-doors deals. 

So what does this mean and why do I find it easy to reason with? Because it's all just laughably comical. Like the MLB, the NCAA is just an absolute clown show. The way the league pissed away all responsibility to try and help their own bottom line is just peak capitalism. It's the perfect representation of our society as a whole--and what happens when an industry cannot collude to keep wages down. In that regard, it's similar to the wage spike during COVID as companies were going crazy with their hirings and record profits. The frenzy won't last, and none of us really know how it will look when the dust settles.

So what's the point of getting worked up over it now? I just enjoy the craziness of the ride as a general sports fan rather than specifically a UW fan. I get that UW is kind of on the wrong end of things right now and that makes it more difficult to enjoy the sports as a fan, which sucks, but it's not the end of the world in a constantly evolving landscape. And let's be honest, UW--at least with basketball and football--has always had a ceiling that was somewhere around ""good but not great"" for some years, occasionally reaching their grand peaks of ""great but not championship caliber"" or ""great but not even the best in the B1G."" Regardless, they have always struggled to take the next steps with their programs, and blaming NIL (or even players involved in NIL) is a modern cop out to an old problem. And it's an excuse that won't be sustainable for too much longer when NIL does stabilize a bit.",reddit,campus

"Former local, from elementary school to graduation. Worked in the food industry every summer in the Dells. This is my Go to List my wife and I cycle through whenever we pass through once every couple weeks. No specific order but I'll point out my favorites.

Sorry for the nove ahead of time. Here's the TL;DR

If I had to say must stops:
- The Cove Supper Club 
- Monk's Downtown Bar and Grill
- Fields at the Wilderness for Happy Hour
- High Rock Cafe for Dinner after the above
- If you're feeling spendy and it's open: Ishnala but Del Bar is the back up plan if it's not.



1. *High Rock Cafe* (Personal Favorite) - relatively modern American food but creatively done. They try to be seasonally appropriate with their menu as well including their drink menus.

2. *Sorento's* - Italian food that won't break the bank and is decent. Their pizza is pretty good too.

3. *Fields @ the Wilderness* - Hit up their happy hour, it's insanely well priced and you get to try a lot of their selections at a smaller more affordable price. My wife and I will hit happy hour here and then go somewhere else.

4. *Monk's Bar &amp; Grill (Downtown Location)* (Personal Favorite) - classic American bar food but done well. Get the fried onions on a Black &amp; Bleu burger and don't look back. Get deep fried pickles as well, full order not a half plus a cold Monks 47 on tap which is brewed by Point Brewery. This was my go to spot after work in my 20's. I miss my corner spot at the far end of the bar. CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, DO NOT GO TO THE MONKS AT THE WILDERNESS, THE DOWNTOWN ONE IS THE ONLY ONE WORTH IT.

5. *Summer House* - outside seating and views of the lake. Good food and specials. Only open spring through fall. Their peel an eat shrimp special was dank. This place is owned by the owners of Pizza Pub.

6. *Ravina Bay* - again, outside seating and standard American pub and grub type food but with lake access and a view of the bay on Lake Delton. Good place to go for a nightcap more than anything and Green Owl Pizza is right there so it's a nice place to get some late night comfort pizza and one last drinkski or two before scootin' out.

7. *The Villa Pizza Company* - go here for pizza, don't bother with pizza pub, it's been over hyped for literally fucking ever. The only good thing about it was that they had a $5 student pizza buffet we would burn 10 minutes of our 40 minute lunch period just to get to. Besides that, not worth it.

#Mexican Food, my wife is Mexican so here you go#:

1. *Play Azul* - mainly seafood fare. Get the Michelada and a shrimp cocktail or tostada de pulpo. Won't be disappointed

2. *El Taco Loco* - if they have birria tacos, get them. This place is pretty damn good if you ask me. Food cart style business within a building. 

3. *Tortilleria La Abuelita* - for anything else.

#Some that are a little out of the way, but wholly worth it and technically in the Dells Area#

1. *Tumbled Rock Brewery* - beer is good and this place has some serious appetizer game and their brunch is up there too. Beer is a little pricey but we like it for the food more than anything.

2.  *Cimaroli's* (Personal Favorite) - good atmosphere, great old fashioneds, no reservations and a classic just go to supper club that's easier on the wallet then the other supper clubs listed below

3. *Club 23* - just outside of the dells going towards Briggsville. Supper club that is reasonably priced and good food with a comfortable atmosphere. 

4. *The Cove* (top of my top personal favorite places) - little out of the way in Briggsville but is on Lake Mason and has great fish fry and great old fashioneds. Place istl just kind of one of those places. Hard to explain but I feel like I'm back home when I go there.

#The next three will be similar in cost and quality as they are higher end supper clubs and are on the $$$ scale#

1. *Ishnala* (personal favorite) - Only open in the summer though October but with it's incredible views of my former stomping grounds (Mirror Lake State Park) it's hard to beat trying to get there. They don't take reservations, it's first come first serve but the food is really good and the atmosphere itself is an experience. Thoroughly worth it in my opinion and a must.

2. *The Del Bar (Formerly Jimmy's Del Bar)* - beautiful atmosphere and great food. Can't really say much else.l other then get a reservation in the Wine Room or Table 10 if you can.

3. *House of Embers* - another supper clubs with great food and a cool atmosphere. You get what you pay for here as well in terms of good food and service. Del Bar and House of Embers are neighbors across the street.

#Places To Avoid# 

1. *Pizza Pub* - as mentioned before...just nope outta that one.

2. *B-Lux* - also hard nope. Service is hit or miss and food is over priced and is made elsewhere cheaper and better. Also owned by Pizza Pub Owners. Summer House is their best venture if you ask me.

3. *Moosejaw* - don't let it fool you. They pack that parking lot like no other but the service, beer (except craft soda) and their pizza are all not worth the cost or the time it takes to get anything. I would recommend pizza pub first before Moosejaw. 

4. *Buffalo Phil's* - gimmicky tourist trap for people with kids. Owned by the owners of MooseJaw. Service, quality of food and food offerings are just not there.",reddit,downtown

Class A retailers, for example, say a convenience store, cannot continue to sell beer between midnight and 6 am in Wisconsin, but they can, by local ordinance, continue to *restrict* these hours (a city is within their rights to make it the law for class a’s to stop selling beer at, say, 10 pm.)

"Outlook for Badgers Football 2024-2025 Season: Get Ready to Adjust Your Expectations for Year 2 of the Luke Fickell Era With a Difficult Schedule in the New Ridiculous B1G Conference It's late June, which means a lot of analysts and reporters are coming out with their college football previews and predictions for the upcoming season. From what I am seeing, Badgers fans are going to have to appropriately calibrate their expectations for Year 2 of the Luke Fickell era given the difficult schedule we will have in the horrifically expanded B1G that now includes a ridiculous 18 teams.

On the [6/21/2024 episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEu6RozC8IU) of the Badgers football podcast ""The Camp"", Zach Heilprin (Sports Director, WOZN the Zone) and Jesse Temple (Badgers Beat Reporter, The Athletic) recently projected the Badgers finishing the 2024 regular season at about a 7-5 record. This would place the Badgers in the category of a ""bowl hopeful"" team and out of reach of being a ""playoff contender"" team (even with the expanded 12 team playoffs coming this season).

In his 2024 College Football Preview magazine, long-time analyst [Phil Steele projects the Badgers to finish 9th in the B1G](https://badgerswire.usatoday.com/lists/big-ten-2024-football-preview-phil-steele-power-rankings/) (behind Nebraska and Rutgers at 7th and 8th, respectively...! On paper I do expect both Nebraska and Rutgers to be better than they were last year. The question is: Will they be better than us?). He also projects Ohio State and Oregon at Tied for 1st while projecting Penn State, Michigan, Iowa, and USC at 3rd through 6th in the B1G. The Badgers play all eight teams projected ahead of them in the B1G except for Ohio State and Michigan. Setting aside what should be wins at home vs. Western Michigan and South Dakota, we also play Alabama, Purdue, Penn State, Oregon, and Minnesota at home while playing at USC, at Rutgers, at Northwestern, at Iowa, and at Nebraska. No wonder Steele rates us as having the 20th most difficult 2024 schedule in college football.

It seems reasonable to expect improvement on offense and defense compared to last season, but our schedule this year will be a serious challenge. Some main takeaways I have:

* Given the difficulty of the schedule, *reasonable* expectations for defining a successful season probably look something like this: Assuming we lose vs. Alabama, vs. Penn State, vs. Oregon, and at Iowa, if we can win 7 or 8 regular season games total and at least hang around in the assumed losses, that's probably a successful season for Year 2 of the Luke Fickell era.
* To meet the above expectations, it feels to me like we need to at least win three out of four when it comes to at USC, at Rutgers, at Northwestern, and at Nebraska (or even winning at Iowa would be great, but their defense and special teams will be loaded again). It's unfortunate for us that those are all on the road.
* Heilprin and Temple discussed that our B1G conference opener on the road at USC is an important inflection point for the season. Assuming we lost vs. Alabama the previous week, we want to set the right tone for conference play in this game.
* Although it was unfortunate that Tanner Mordecai got injured last season, I thought he performed pretty well when he was healthy. We need to not regress at QB in order to be successful and properly execute Offensive Coordinator Phil Longo's dAIRy raid system. Although transfer Tyler Van Dyke was highly recruited, he turned into a turnover machine at Miami, so I am very nervous about what to expect there. Hopefully, Braedyn Locke has continued to develop in case Van Dyke ends up imploding or getting injured.
* Even though the RB room looks good in general, we really need Chez Mellusi to not get injured again. He really is the RB that fits Longo's system well.
* I hope and think the O-Line can be better this season, as we have 3 starters returning and we could have a healthy Jake Renfro at Center.
* Our defense needs to take a step forward as well. We have some great guys (S Hunter Woehler and CB Ricardo Hallman are two of my personal favorites), but I'm looking for more to step up, perhaps especially CB Nyzier Fourqurean.
* I'm going to go ballistic if we continue to sail the ball out of bounds during a kick. We can't afford to be having penalties that give our opponents good field position with the schedule we have.

I think it will be important for Badgers fans to adjust their expectations accordingly. Honestly, I am mainly writing this for myself to keep my sanity when we inevitably lose in Week 3 to Alabama and I start looking down the barrel of the gun that is our B1G conference schedule. It can be a good season at 7 wins with us still playing markedly better football than last season (although I can envision the possibility that it ends up being a lot worse, but hopefully not).",reddit,general madison

"Enough Why are we subsidizing the NFL and NBA?

Least we forget, the UW is an educational institution.  It does not exist to support the NFL or NBA.

I love watching the Badgers play and it is extremely exciting when they win.  Our times at Camp Randall, the hockey championships, the final fours as well as all the other wins from student athletes are all exciting.  I get it.

The UW should welcome and support student athletes who want an education and want to graduate.  Scholarships for athletes are fine and money they earn on their own is fine as long as they, like all the other students, maintain their academic status. 

Athletes should not be paid to attend classes.  High school students who want only to play sports and not attend college should go to the minor leagues, not the UW.

Under no circumstances should we be putting money towards paying students to play sports at UW.  Money needs to go towards scholarships, endowed chairs and other academic programs not NILs

Things are totally fucked up right now.  We need to get a grip and see how things play out with NILs and the transfer portal.  The current system is not sustainable; there is no reason to take part in this bullshit.

The UW is an institute of higher learning, not a minor league club.  If athletes want a million dollar NIL, the UW may not be the best place for them.  The current system is a disservice to our past student athletes.",reddit,camp randall

"I don’t disagree; I am just not entirely convinced about cause and effect. When I was a kid, almost everyone shopped locally. At that time, far more people also made a living wage. The loss of decent jobs and the loss of small businesses happened at the same time, so I don’t think it’s entirely accurate to blame the latter on rural residents when it was part of a much bigger shift. People didn’t abandon their local grocers en masse without prompting - it happened in a setting of economic changes that had a deep and lasting negative impact on rural communities. 

Ultimately the economic behavior of rural and urban people is similar but the impact is different. I have lived very urban and very rural, and in both situations I avoided getting my most basic groceries at the nearest store. The behavior is the same; the difference is that the urban store has a larger population to keep it afloat. My point is that it’s not reasonable to say that rural people are responsible for overpriced canned tomatoes at the corner store, but urban people are not. 

That said, I don’t think this is utopia and I definitely get frustrated. It’s harmful to buy donuts at Kwik Trip when there is a local bakery in town. It’s harmful to buy ground beef from Walmart when a local farmer offers it for the same price or even less. But I can’t blame people for shopping at Aldi when the only local option charges four times more for sugar and isn’t even locally owned. They’re just trying to manage in a world of few options.",reddit,general madison

"You’ll be in for the exact opposite here.  Dec - Feb can be extremely cold and often dreary and overcast.  Nov, March and April are crapshoots.  We’re having a lovely sunny 54 today, but mid-April blizzards happen.  

We moved to Madison @ 20 years ago. People are friendly but can also be reserved.  If you’re working remote, you may have to really put yourself out there to meet people.

Schools are fine. Not great (although there are certainly some great teachers) but not terrible.

Drinking is HUGE here. Beer is a common drink of choice at baby showers, kids birthday parties, kids sporting events, etc. The news often has stories of people getting their 6th, 7th or 8th OWI.  

Housing is tough if you want to be in Madison proper, particular near the best public schools. Lakes make for less land area and fewer houses, so inventory can be scarce. Competing with other buyers is the norm.  If you’re selling a house and bringing a wad of cash, you may not feel that strain so much.  

Madison also is not cheaper than larger cities in terms of many goods and services. We moved from a large city and were surprised at how much restaurants, dry cleaning, groceries, etc cost.

"Looking for second semester housing Hello, all. Future grad Badger here.

So, at present, I'm under a lease at my current apartment until February of next year. Unfortunately I live about 30 minutes from downtown (by car), and I'd have to change buses like three times if I used public transit, so if one was late, that would be game over for me getting to class that day. I'll have to drive no matter what for first semester.

Likewise, I'm looking to actually move to campus (or at least near it), but I wouldn't be leasing until January or February of next year. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how best to handle this? Recommendations for apartment management companies?

"Med Student Looking for Housing for August 1st 2024! Hello All!

I am a career-changer that is about to start medical school in my 30s and am having a hard time finding housing in Madison! I am looking for the following so I wanted to post here to see if anyone might have a property that would work for me! Here is my list:

**Must-Haves**

* Central AC
* House, townhouse, or duplex (no apartments)
* In-unit laundry
* Close to the medical school (ideally walking distance but can be within a 15-min drive)
* Decent kitchen since I cook a lot!
* Private landlord/owner (no PM companies)

**Wish List**

* Dog-friendly- I had a dog that passed recently but would love to have a place that is dog-friendly should I want to adopt in the near future.
* Some green space
* Off-street or Covered parking

I am ideally looking for a 2+ bedroom place since I plan on getting a female/nonbinary roommate (so I am also happy to join someone's place as a roommate as well)! My budget for my portion of the rent is roughly $750-1000/mo (not incl utilities) so for a 2br I would like it to be under $2200/mo. I would love to stay in the place I find for the duration of med school if possible and really make it feel like a home! I can provide references and background checks as well if needed!",reddit,general madison
"SOAR for parents is a huge waste of time  I took my son to both days this week and it was literally like sitting through a marketing spiel at a vacation property.

Our kids are already coming to your university. We’ve already researched the hell out of your meal plans and how everything works on campus. 

No, I don’t wanna hear some BS from campus police about how my kids should talk to you…..because I’ve already told them not to…..regardless of your circumstances….because I have a criminal justice degree. 

Telling us all about the campus resources at this point is a time waster. 

If you’re involved with your kids, you already have investigated this.

Plus, the food you served at the end of the first night on the first day was absolutely abhorrent. I ended up taking my kid a couple blocks away to get some pizza at Ian’s on Frances Street.

Thank you, UW, for making me spend two days with my ex-wife for absolutely no reason. Other than to make sure that she didn’t hover over him. Great times.

It would’ve been better if they just gathered our kids up for orientation and gave parents drink tickets at Street Street bars so we can advise them on the best places to hang out as undergraduates.",reddit,campus

You could check out the Capitol and State Street in the morning. State Street runs from the Capitol to the campus and has a lot of stores and restaurants along the way. Also Memorial Union Terrace is a cool spot to check out at well. It’s just off of state street at the campus end. All the sunburst chairs have been put away for the season but you can still grab a beer inside the terrace or some ice cream that is made on campus and check out the building. It’s right on Lake Mendota and is one of the main attractions of campus.,reddit,downtown
I used to live in STL. Loved my time there. Skip the zoo. Your free zoo is way better and ours might be a bit of a let down. I would park in the parking garage downtown at N lake and state street. Walk around state street a touch and tour through library mall. The UW bookstore there has some of the best apparel and gift collections. Walk to bascom hill and let your kids play in the grass. Consider walking over to the student union (it’s right on water and fun to see). If you have time you could load back up and drive and park near the capitol. It’s fun to walk through.,reddit,downtown

"State Street is great, but it’s just totally separate from the gameday scene.

"I've never been to state street for a pregame so I can't personally speak on it, but I also don't know of any good tailgates that happen there.

Go to Regent Street for pregame and State Street for post game,reddit,downtown
"Drinking. Lots of it. All the bars in the area well have an outdoor tailgate most of the day, and normal things to do will be totally swarmed with people. If it's a night game and you're there early enough you can hit up Mickies next to the stadium for a classic diner experience, but its going to be super swarmed starting very early.  Otherwise state Street on the other side of campus will have lots of shops/ restaurants/ bars as well.

Personally I recommend finding some deep fried curds to prep for drinking, my favourites are at Lucille and the Great Dane. The old fashioned is most peoples favourite, but it'll probably be a 2+ hour wait for a table on game day there. Head to a bar, drink and be merry. 

Other than that getting from gate to seat at Camp Randall can take anywhere from 10-30 minutes, so show up well ahead of time if you want to see kickoff- if you cut it close you'll probably miss a good chunk of the 1st quarter.",reddit,downtown

"Park a couple miles away either off the capitol (especially if a Saturday) or west Washington ave. Migrate toward the stadium on either state street or regent street, hitting up bars along the way. If it’s a Saturday you can try to hit the farmers market around the square, it’s a nice stroll with a lot of local flavor. Plan for at least four hours before the game. 

Night before check out the memorial Union terrace for a delightful patio beer overlooking lake mendota. If you want a little nature you can hike out to picnic point or through the arboretum.",reddit,downtown
"It's a night game! Honestly, I think the best thing about Madison is that there's no ""one thing"" that you have to do. There's a ton going on, and you're never going to hit everything. The bars near the stadium are almost like tailgate lots without cars (Jordans is a favorite for me). State Street Brats is probably the quintessential gameday bar that you find all over the country. Dotty's and the Old Fashioned are alumni staples that will be packed but worth it. The Rathskeller at Memorial Union will be really relaxed.  Overall, you just really can't go wrong. Hope you enjoy it!",reddit,downtown
No watch party at the union as far as I know. Tailgate before the game and watch the game at some bar in downtown.,reddit,downtown
"Downtown/campus the official lots all have 'Event Day Price' that varies depending on the lot and closeness to the stadium. I've paid $20-40 over the years. This game will probably be the higher end of that range. I like the underground lot under Lucky's apartments between University and Johnson, great for getting out of town and car isn't hot or cold. 

Then there's tons of folk who sell their lawn and driveway space which can vary a lot. I've had good luck with a guy 2-3 blocks west of the stadium who charges $30.",reddit,downtown
"I could say “I called it” when Fickell arrived.  Mid tier at best for the program and then the Big10  brings in the PAC teams now mid tier for the Badgers is 7 wins season, max.

Wisconsin is the old school built on tradition and history but kids don’t want that, unless you plan on graduating. Recruits now want money and fame and you won’t get that at Wisconsin.  The kids that cant get into those relevant schools want to play for a coach that inspires them and Luke is not that guy.  I was eating at a restaurant downtown Madison and Luke showed up… no one cared.  He could have been the valet there was so little “wow” from the diners.  Now had Deon Sanders walked in you would have seen a commotion, you’d get some hype.  The Badgers got what they paid for.  Accept it.",reddit,downtown
If you’re willing to walk you can park for free in the residential areas. We normally park down by the villas zoo and walk from there. If you want to park closer there are lots along regent where you can park for 20 dollars roughly. Another option is to grab lunch or a beer at the Great Dane and then jump on their shuttle service which drops you off by the stadium. You can avoid the congestion near the stadium and pay less for parking by parking on the other side of the downtown area. Just a couple of ideas.,reddit,downtown
"First it’s hard to beat a team 3 times. I do think chucky plays and I think wall goes today. All five Wisconsin starters need to play down hill with hopes of not only scoring but get Purdue in foul trouble.

Purdue is that good that they could beat us

"About 12 years ago, we had a whole pizza from the one on Mineral Point. I snatched an edge piece with a nice big blob of burned on cheese on the crust. Saved that bite for last - I love burned cheese bits.

As it was about to go in, I realized it wasn't cheese. It was a huge fly that had been baked onto the crust.

I completely boycotted them. For about a week.

I also adore the whole vibe of the restaurants. They're always a little bit....strange. Many happy memories of taking my kids to the arcade at the MP location, and it's sad to go there now and just see the blocked-off black void back there. Even that gives the place a certain pleasing oddness, though.

My other main location was at Westgate. The ghost town mall. Used to like eating a slice and watching the old folk do their exercise walks around the place. They were the only people there. The fact that the mall was dated and eerily quiet just suited the RR experience perfectly.

Then I lived near the one on Regent for a while. That one was odd. Any time I got take-out, it was like they used different cheese. It looked more orange and had a slightly odd texture. If we ate *in* the place, though, it was the usual RR pizza. That place was the ultimate Madison experience - RR and Greenbush Bakery in one hit.

"Stumbled on this had to comment sorry for the delayed reply…Winnebago mental health has been one of the worst experiences of my life!!! I’m not a criminal. I suffer from mental illness. This was my second time there. I had been once before but not to the highest security area. I was told I was being put there because other mental health facilities were full. ( for context of the story I’m a female in my early 40s with bipolar disorder) I’ve been dealing with the mental health care system my whole life. It’s indescribable how horrible it is.

This time I was put in the highest level restriction and security unit. The rooms were stark cement and cold, very small with just a plastic cubby hanging on the wall. Little did I know I would be mixed in with criminals. 😳 I was put into the worst unit in the prison…oops I mean hospital. I saw a 300+ lbs giant brought in after an arrest to detain. Lots of tension in the room! The only person in there that could put together a coherent sentence was a convicted murderer. He was very nice , my heart bled for his story. We both watched the shit show unfold. You are assigned a table and cannot stand up or leave your seat in the day room. No stretching?!! lol wtf? The killer I befriended ( I don’t know what to call it) said to “look out” cause the large guy was eyeing people looking to start trouble. I watched as he held his hands up behind a girl like he was going to choke her. Held them there for a few seconds and walked away. He kept asking her if she was possessed. I was on the phone, which if you were able to get a turn was 10min call once and hour which was impossible because they weren’t allowed during the “kindergarten sessions” I call it this because the classes are designed for second graders. Coping skills and healing are not in your grasp. So really there wasn’t much time for outside contact at all. While I’m sitting there on the phone the big guy walks up to this young kid and says “what are you looking at?” and head butts him with a loud cracking sound. He then backed the kid up to the wall. I screamed- then he didn it again!!! The staff came running and he stopped it. Too late anyhow. No way these kids (the staff) could take a guy this large down. He could’ve killed us all if he wanted. The victim kid is in his early 20s ended up with a concussion, bloody nose and swollen face. So, as this was happening, they sent us all to our rooms. One of the really sweet kid popped out his room and asked if we could come out yet. He went back inside his room. He was upset, I think autistic, but since he was upset, he started yelling and banging, and then I proceeded to see squat team come in with all their combat gear. What I could hear from the room was the most horrendous hollers you could’ve ever imagine I could hear him screaming “I can’t breathe! you’re choking me get off of me!” They must’ve maced him or something when he came out his face was swollen and bright red for days.

We shared one bathroom with 20 people. And you had to ask every time you had to use the bathroom. It’s nuts cause the bathroom had 6 toilets in it. I watched an old man pee himself waiting for the bathroom 😢 I have to mention there are life patients in a different part of This facility so I imagine they are even worse than the unit for shorter stays. They are housed in the super creepy old part of the building. It’s all very unsettling though. They keep you in toughest/craziest/scariest section until you are drugged up enough and a total zombie calm enough to move the person to the next section that has less restrictions if you could even say that but at least much calm  and not quite as threatening. I was totally sain at the time of arrival was not suicidal. I was put in this facility against my will. It was a nightmare. I am so sick and tired of being treated like a criminal because I have a mental illness. I was more than willing to voluntarily go to a hospital. They even were trying to find me a bed in a women’s shelter. I was going through some struggles with my husband, but I believe because a policeman on duty didn’t like me in the hospital where I was being treated for hypothermia looking for my daughter who ran away. he put me where he wanted me. The police department I’m referring to is EVIL.

I couldn’t have books, sheets, pens and even after I was moved to the next section and was supposed to be allowed my items, I asked every day and they never gave them to me. By that point I stopped asking because someone mentioned don’t bug them too much or they might just steal your stuff.

There were a couple of nurses there that were really wonderful one in particular Dory was absolutely amazing. She really touched my soul and gave me hope. She even teared up when I left which I couldn’t believe. It made me feel so loved and hopeful that it’s possible to at least have people in the world that make a difference and can touch you heart even in a horrible place like Winnebago. So Dory if you’re reading this, you know who I am I hope sending much love and thanks!

When you first go there, they don’t know anything about you so they have to assess you, but sometimes they start you out at the most severe unit for the first few days while they experiment out the medication’s on you and see how nuts you are. I was in the most terrifying high restriction sector for about Five days before they moved to a different unit. Five days no books, sheets, music , writing instrument except for a crayon in the day room. No outside, snack rights, etc.

There is no therapy there is no real care. I learned that my partner across the table from me when they moved me to the next section was in because mental illness, but he was also just finishing his time served for kidnapping, a young girl and putting her in his trunk. I had to sit with this man every single day and eat three meals, he was creepy. He gave me the chills everything was icy. I felt nauseous trying to eat with his chilling presence. Terrifying! I believe I was brought to this area of the facility because the first time I was brought in. I hardly remember a thing I had overdosed. The last thing I remember there was being stuck with a needle in the butt and strap to a board for hours while I screamed and screamed. It was excruciatingly painful. They kept saying we’ll untie you soon as you calm down but even when I was calm, they would not undo the straps as I laid there with tears running down my face that I couldn’t even wipe. So maybe that’s why they started me out in this area the next time.

I didn’t remember the admission from the first time I went, I got the full experience the second time. They totally strip all your clothes down and examine your body as you stand there with two people looking at you for anything that might stand out. Humiliating, especially you’re not really doing too good in the head.

I have a really good insurance, so there’s absolutely no reason I should be going to a place that I sit down with a murderer for lunch every day for a week and then the following week I sit down with a pedophile kidnapper. I did not get better I got worse!

I was given a chemical lobotomy in there, and I’ve never been the same since or will be again. I would not send my worse enemy to this place. Being forced to ingest something into your body that you know you can’t take, but they don’t listen and force you. Everything about it is so inhuman!

I do have to say that I am a vegetarian and their options for food were pretty decent. That’s about the only thing I can say to look at the upside. You appreciate things so much more when you have been stripped of EVERYTHING. The first time I was there I listened to a girl, banging her head against a wall for over 15 or 20 minutes. Well, an ex military gentleman had to scold and yell at the staff , “why aren’t you doing something about it!” And their answer was that they were, and they literally were just standing there. It was horrifying! The girl had been in there for a really long time and had to wear a restraint suit as did another patient this last stay. No use of hands! Cant imagine the damage she had done to her head. I don’t think I will be right ever again after these experiences. Healthcare in America is a joke!

Please, please don’t ever send one of your loved ones here at all costs! If you want to save their life and it’s really that urgent call EVERY hospital it the state!! Just NOT HERE! And if you ever do find yourself ending up here, they are supposed to read you your rights upon arrival, which they did not read to me. You have the right to remain silent! If I had to do it all over again I would’ve kept shut my mouth so that they had to release me within 72 hours. Biggest shit show I’ve ever seen in my life and the most traumatizing too. No way to get well no calmness no quiet time no feeling safe. That’s one of the things I had a really hard time with is that I did not feel safe and there, because of many of the other patients who had just come from jail.

"TLDR: I know this reply looks super long; Most of it is just because since you mentioned you were going to London I thought I’d give some personal recommendations!

Didn’t bother me whatsoever. I actually assumed they were from kind of more southern Minnesota when they spoke? They sounded like, as you described, the “Fargo” accent but definitely toned down from the small towns in the film and tv shows!

Drinking here is great, honestly. I don’t know who drinks the most in the world; I honestly don’t really care beyond a trivial conversation. I prefer talking about what peoples are great to drink with, and I’ll be honest, British pub culture is one of the best drinking cultures in the world. Pretty much the entire country is covered in an absurd amount of cozy places to drink beer. And we might love to hate it, but Spoons IS a great place to load up on pints before transitioning somewhere nicer.

If you want a fantastic couple of pubs in London, I’ll chuck you a couple lesser known ones in North London! Camden and Islington are great for pubs, and though the Market is just depressingly commercialised now, Camden is still a great place for a night out. I’ll also throw in some restaurant recommendations and stuff, just in case!

However, Pubs you should definitely think about checking out:

The Pineapple, Kentish Town.

If this was on a more popular subreddit, I honestly probably might have left this off of the list. The pineapple is the best kept secret in London and my personal favourite pub in the world. It’s got incredible local support (The land got bought up; The new landlords were gonna turf the owner out and develop flats, but were so astonished at the strength and numbers of the petitioning that they agreed to keep it there). It’s fantastically cozy, has a lovely little beer garden and a great community feel. Standard London prices, a little on the expensive side but not too much so.

The Faltering Fulback:

You said you’re coming in August? Might be nice to check if it’s a premier league night before coming here, since it gets RAMMED whenever Arsenal are playing, especially if it’s a champions league night. Nice pub, covered in ivy and a good vibe to it. Very big too, and has huge TVs (if you do wanna watch a game!)

The Magdala:

Stunning pub next to Hampstead Heath (I don’t know if you’ve been to Hampstead Heath. A shocking amount of people who visit London haven’t. It’s literally fucking amazing, especially in the summer. I legitimately think it might be one of the best green spaces in a city in the world. It’s truly fantastic.

Anyways, The Magdala has a solid beer collection (it is pretty pricey though, so good place to go for one or two) but more importantly, it was the pub outside which Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed in the UK, shot her husband. The inside is absolutely beautiful, and it’s nice to have a great pint in a great pub that also has that nice air of history.

The Black Heart.

The Black Heart in Camden. Hard Rock and Metal bar, that isn’t that expensive and has a pinball machine. I’ve spent so long getting crossfaded and playing that pinball machine. Just real turn your brain off and have fun.

The Spaniards Inn

It’s expensive, yeah. Really expensive. But if you guys haven’t, it’s a pretty must have in regards to Roast dinners in London. It’s also next to Hampstead Heath, and it’s designed more as a kind of imitation of a country pub. It’s a truly AWESOME Sunday Roast and a pint, the food is fucking amazing, but it’s definitely not cheap!

Camden Head:
Great place to get sloppy near the end of the night, as it’s open pretty late. Mostly a young crowd I’d say, but it’s Camden so everyone’s welcome. Grim in the daytime, but by night the music is on and loud, the lights are darkened, and everyone’s too hammered or on too many powders to do much but dance and have a good time, so as said; Good for getting a bit sloppy in.

Charlotte Street Hotel:

Not a pub. It’s a hotel bar in Piccadilly Circus. I normally only ever go there for a date, but I personally far prefer hotel bars to cocktail bars, and this bar in particular is fucking fantastic. It’s also pretty close to Brasserie Zedel, which is a great French brasserie in a huge art deco building that does a three course fixed meal for like £20. It’s honestly a pretty class deal.

Rules:

If you guys really wanna splash out? When it comes to traditional English fare done right, there is nowhere like Rules. In my family, we don’t really do presents for a Birthday, we do a dinner; Me and my Dad alternate picking Rules. It’s the oldest restaurant in London, and it’s indulgent to its finest. The beer is served in metal tankards. Cocktails brought to your meal in your little booth as you gorge yourselves silly. The food is always great, but since you guys are going in August, you might able to catch them in some of the game seasons, which Rules famously specialises in. Their game dishes are truly fantastic. The last time I personally went was after winning a pretty good chunk of money at a race day (Ascot) so I blew most of it on taking two of my mates to Rules. Fantastic fucking meal, and obviously cause no one was using any of their paycheck we gorged and drank to a huge degree.

Hawley Arms:

Can be a bit naff, due to the fact that it was Amy Winehouse’s favourite pub. I always mention it to people as a rec in case they’re a fan. They definitely make sure you know that, and sometimes fans of Amy come just as a sort of pilgrimage and don’t drink which is weird. It’s mostly pretty nice though; More importantly, it often hosts gigs, so it’s a pretty good place to catch music. However, I far prefer:

Green Note:
Fantastic live music venue in Camden. Often has eclectic artists, mostly jazz, folk, blues etc. I often grab a couple pints in Camden then head in for a show. It’s a great place with a great feel, and whoever the fuck is finding the people that play there is doing wonders. One example, a random show I caught there is the reason I got into Icelandic Jazz

Bermondsey Beer Mile:

If you wanna get a bit of a craft fix, head to Bermondsey. The beer mile is just basically a long thing of different people selling their beers. It’s kind of a beer market almost. It’s really nice though, and if you’re a beer enthusiast I’d really advise going.

The only wine bar that comes to mind as worth remembering that I’ve been to, though I’ve only been to a couple, is Jamaica wine bar. Really nice vibe, lovely building, just all around a nice place.",reddit,general madison
"If you are going to be near state street, then the Memorial Union Terrace is an absolute must. Grab a beer there and a table. The views of the lake and the vibe is great.",reddit,downtown
"My recommendation to you would be to start at the Union terrace. It’s a great pregame atmosphere on Lake Mendota. Good bar food available inside, and a grill outside. Cheese curds are a must.

As many others suggested, state street has a host of bars worth visiting, but it really depends upon how lit you want to get. Mondays is cheap and every drink is at least a double, but mostly triples. State Street Brats is also good for bar food and reasonably priced beers and drinks. Will Ferrell was just there on the patio last weekend.

A small walk up the block there’s university Avenue. Vintage has great burgers and a laidback environment. Wandos is good for their signature fishbowls (again, unless you want to blackout by kickoff, drink these with a friend). Churchkey towards the stadium and en route to Regent Street.

The options on Regent are aplenty, many are outdoors and super charged up atmospheres. I’d bar hop to the stadium from there.

Unless you’re a 20 year old girl looking to hook up with a frat fuck, I would avoid the KK.

Enjoy Madison! If you’re around the day after, there’s plenty to do outside of drinking. But either way, have fun!

Mertz looked like THE quarterback we needed (for one game) and then he got COVID. Who knows if the IL game was a fluke or if COVID derailed Mertz more than we could ever know. 

Fickell SEEMED like a great fit but for whatever reason he chose to drive away most of Chryst's players. Maybe we would be in the same place or worse with Leonard but there is no doubt that Fickell hasn't come close to living up to the expectations. The team now has no identity. 

The Air Raid depends on having a quality QB. Two years in and I don't want to trash Locke, but none of the QBs seem close to what they need. Glass half full people can say TVD but I saw enough of him to know why Miami didn't want him. We need a QB that can make quick and accurate throws. Then we can see if the Air Raid can work here.

After the game I would walk down to state street and find a nice restaurant that you can get in at. I like Paul’s pelmeni dumplings, dotty dumpling dowry for burgers, Ian’s for just fun pizza, or state street brats for the atmosphere.

Monona Terrace was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and is a really cool structure.  You’ll walk across the Capitol Square, or walk through the Capitol building if you want.  The walk down State Street is fun as you start heading towards campus.  

Access in and out is super easy, especially if coming from the east and south.  Pricing was always reasonable with ample parking.  You’ll see little to no game traffic on that side of town coming and going.

"My dad grew up in a very German household that used drinking as a social norm. Parents and grandparents started drinking highballs everyday at 4. When my dad would be sick as a kid, they would give him a little hot tottie to feel better. “Hair of the dog” was often used as a hangover cure. This was the early 60s. 

My dad also was a teen during the whole 18 being the drinking age. He and his buddies would fill the back of his car up with beer, ice, and kegs and have parties out of the trunk. Pretty normal stuff at the time. 

One time a cop pulled him and his buddies over for drinking on the side of the road out of the trunk. Cop drove behind them to make sure they got home safe. 

Alcohol is readily available at all events. I’m talking graduation parties, baby showers, weddings, tailgating, and even after church going out for a meal. We have Oktoberfest, summer fest, brewer games, fall festivals, cranberry fest, packer games~ lots of events surrounded by or with drinking. 

It’s expected to drink here because of the availability of bars on pretty much every corner and the culture. Going out after work for drinks with coworkers can be normal depending on your line of work.

Hop on Regent street, there is a little liquor store i worked at by park street and as you make your way towards the stadium, regent runs into it, there are sports bars that usually have big tailgates.

State street is the most dense with spots but that is more the downtown area and away from the stadium. 

Non bar suggestions. If you are near the stadium green bush bakery has some great donuts and Mickey’s dinner is excellent, it is cash only though as a heads up.

"Teachers looking to move to WI from Vegas...tips on where to live? Long read ahead, sorry in advance if you manage to make it through!

Me and my (soon-to-be) husbands would love some advice about possibly moving to wisconsin in a few years. To start, we're both teachers. I teach Kindergarten but could teach anything K-5, and my partner teaches high school history, but has also taught middle school and would be willing to do either. 

We're looking at Wisconsin for a few different reasons. We love the packers, he's from the midwest (Iowa) but doesnt want to live there again, and I love the PNW but we're priced out and its too difficult to get a teaching job up there. We both grew up in super small towns but are tired of living in our huge city and want to raise our family in a small or mid sized town. We've also both lived in cold climates (Iowa and norther Idaho) but not as cold as I imagine most of Wisconsin gets. We have read a lot about recent WI education system struggles, but even with Act 10, its still significantly better than where we are in Las Vegas so thats not a concern of ours, but ability to get a job is. We're slightly concerned that most of the towns we're interested in won't have two teacher vacancies at the same time.

Our ideal setting would be a mid-sized town of around 10-30k where kids actually play on lawns and there's town events that keeps the community engaged with each other. Neither one of us enjoys much of a nightlife outside a causal restaurant so ammenities like that arent a requirment. Large box stores within 30 miles is a strong bonus though, especially once we have children. We both love nature - camping, hiking, snowboarding/skiing, and he used to like biking. Living near nature (trees) is a requirement for me. Also, we're looking to settle down long-term and would like to live somewhere thats friendly to transports. We dont want us or our kids to have a hard time socializing because we're not from there. 

So far, here's our (super-long) list of options:

\- Ashland

\- Hayward

\- Eagle River or Rhinelander (read mixed reviews)

\- Stevens Point, Wasau, Waupaca, Wisconsin Rapids, or Marshfield

\- Port Edwards (cant find much info)

\- Eau Claire or Chippewa Falls

\- La crosse (seems so highly reccomended but I think we'll need to visit to understand why)

\- Sturgeon bay, fish creek, sister bay, two rivers

\- De Pere

\- Port Washington, Sheboygan, or Cedarburg 

\- Elkhart Lake

\- Lake Geneva

\- Baraboo or Wisconsin Dells (read mixed things)

\- Hudson

  
Any advice on if ant these towns would be a good place to settle down long-term and raise a family? Any names on here where you think it'd either be really easy, or really difficult to get a teaching job? Also, we're planning on a least one trip to WI before we move anywhere, but our list is still a little too long for that. If you got this far, thank you for reading!",reddit,general madison

"Trying to remember So several years ago, my dad and I took a drive from Chippewa falls area to the twin cities. We went through a small town about halfway I think that was in some sort of valley (or it seemed like it). We went down the side of a cliff into a large open tree’d area with a road through the town. I passed by what looked like a large bar or restaurant on the main drag through town and it was such a beautiful little spot. I’d really love to ride my Harley down there this summer if I knew where I was going. I’d go from Duluth down to Chippewa falls and then over to wherever this down is an back. I’ve heard it might be Alma but checking out the nearby terrain on goggle I’m not 100% sure. If anyone has ANY ideas please comment. I’d really love to revisit that.

"YES. Yes, it is. Sheboygan is awesome. I grew up there, and still visit often. Here are some of my favorites:

Faye’s Pizza for old-school tavern-style/cracker-crust pizza. It’s been a Sheboygan fixture since 1958.

Schultz’s has the best charcoal-grilled  brat patties and butter-drenched burgers on the unique and unmatched Sheboygan hard rolls. They have Faye’s beat in the longevity department by 5 years.

Blast Soft Serve for ice cream and Dole whip.

Black Pig for farm-to-table comfort food. Located downtown in a cool old department store building.

Schwarz Fish Company for take-out fried or smoked fish, sides, and deli salads.

Prohibition Bistro and Urbane have great food and fun atmospheres to kick back, enjoy some wine or a cocktail, and just hang out with friends.

City Bakery, for a mud pie or a long john.

I’ve been to Arrosto Delicatessen, BoMallie’s, Harry’s Diner, and Vene’s Pancake House just once each but would highly recommend.

I love going to Hello Happiness, a second-hand arts-and-crafts-supplies shop, and Happy Rocks, which sells rocks, crystals, beads, essential oils, incense, and jewelry. And Freaktoyz downtown specializes in vintage comics/video games/pop culture memorabilia.

Check out Indian Mounds park, the John Michael Kohler Arts Center (the grounds are beautiful even if the facility is closed), and Bookworm Gardens. Try to catch an event at Christopher Farm and Gardens (it’s usually not open to the public).

Walking out the pier to the lighthouse, then wading knee-deep in the lake, or jumping right in, at Deland Park, is the best way to beat summer heat. 

Stroll up the riverwalk and stop at the Weather Center Cafe for a smoothie or a muffin.

"UW-Superior

Your college experience is always what you make it, but the campus at UWS is probably one of the most walkable. You can also (arguably) walk most of the city, but I was never super keen about trying to cross US-53 or US-2 when I lived there. Their multicultural center is a great place to meet people from all over the world - UWS is attractive to International students because it's the cheapest UW tuition and the cost of living is relatively low compared to other urban areas in the state. 

If you don't care about/put aside college rivalries, you're also in close proximity to the University of Minnesota-Duluth (UMD), the College of St. Scholastica (CSS), Lake Superior College (LSC) and Northwood Technical College (formerly WITC/Wisconsin Indianhead Technical College). Northwood Tech is basically seated on the UWS campus (it's directly across the street from most of the major campus buildings and is right next to the Marcovich Wellness Center, the ""gym"" for UWS), and Superior High School is across the street from one of the dorms. It makes for a hugely academic environment.  

You should be able to transfer at least some, if not all, of your credits from Green Bay to Superior. UWS has an English major, and depending on what you want to do in law, they also have a Legal Studies major (or Criminal Justice minor, Poli Sci minor, or Social Work major). 

If you look hard enough, you can find the ""sweaty, smelly, cramped parties and drinking"" at any campus. However, there are plenty of other social activities to do. I was in Ecopsychology, so my peers and I spent a lot of time at Wisconsin Point. We also took a field trip to Northland College in Ashland, spent a day in Bayfield, and had multiple outdoor classes. The multicultural center (today named the William “Pope” Wright Student Center after one of my absolutely favorite professors) is almost always hosting some celebration, meet-n-greet, activity day, or something to do because they are a gathering place for International students as well as the various American ethnic groups. 

You'll also find social activities via your extra currics, athletics, student orgs or other activities. I was the Managing Editor of the student newspaper while I was there, and we were small-staffed so I also wrote articles for the paper to cover gaps. There were events like beer and wine tasting (for over 21s) at Wessman Arena, Haugfest, theater performances, art gallery shows...hell, I was a poll watcher the year President Obama was elected and got to stay up through poll close and then run coverage back to the newspaper and radio station at UWS. The busiest and most involved period of my life was at UWS. 

The main downside is the amount of snow and cold. I didn't care; I'm from northern Wisconsin, so it was the same as always for me. Students from southern Wisconsin or from warmer states or countries sometimes had a hard time adapting. Other than that, if you're not used to an industrial city, you'll notice the smell of oil and taconite almost right away. Depending on how you feel about being in a port city, the ship and rail traffic in and out can be a non-issue, startling and concerning, or cool and exciting. The November Witch is a real thing and is no fucking joke in bad years; one of the years I was there it bent a flagpole near campus and tore flags from other flagpoles around town, in addition to the usual loose sign/unattended garbage can/lost paper issues. The 2012 Solstice Flood flooded much of the Twin Ports, including parts of the UWS campus. Lake Superior is gorgeous and still my favorite lake, but some of its harsher aspects can be absolutely brutal for people who aren't ready for it.",reddit,campus

Simmons Field in Kenosha is where the Kenosha Comets of the Girls League from A League Of Their Own used to play. It's a shame they didn't film anything there because most of the original structure is still intact. Both the Kenosha Kingfish of the Northwoods League and Kenosha Kings of the Wisconsin State League (both college summer ball) play home games there. Out of those I recommend the Kingfish because the Northwoods League is more known for its quirky promotional nights.

Of course, you have to go to Miller Park and visit the Uecker statues. The serious one where people have been leaving Miller Lites for Bob, and the one in the ""Uecker seats"" that's a send up of his famous Miller Lite ad. 

Fourth Base sports pub in West Allis. All the scenes of fans watching the game at a bar in Major League were filmed there.

Since people are mentioning the Bobblehead Museum, Broken Bat Brewery is right across the street. Not only does it have its own bobblehead collection, but it also has a wiffle ball court and hosts league nights.

The Green Bay Blue Ribbons play at Joannes Stadium, which is a neighborhood park similar to Wrigley Field on a smaller scale. It's almost just as old too and notable for a few reasons:  
  
\-It was the original playing surface for the Packers before City Stadium was build across the street, although the current structure surrounding the field wasn't built until after City Stadium.  
\-It was home to a number of minor league teams affiliated with major league clubs through the 1950s. Rodgers Hornsby played there, and it's believed Jackie Robinson may have played there as well. They were a Dodgers affiliate for a good amount of that time, but records of low level minor leagues from that era are spotty.  
\-The team is actually sponsored by Pabst and features PBR branding on their uniforms. If you're gonna wear a sponsor, it may as well be arguably the most iconic brand in the history of Wisconsin.  
  
Fox Cities Stadium, home of the Brewers affiliated Wisconsin Timber Rattlers is a must. They're also known for quirky promotions. A lot of history too... David Ortiz played there before he was a major leaguer. Their old stadium, Goodland Field (now Nienhaus Stadium) from when they were the Appleton Foxes is still around. The Foxes were the most successful team in the history of the Midwest League (9 pennants) and their alumni include Earl Weaver, Goose Gossage, Boog Powell, Harold Baines, and Alex Rodriguez.

The Fond Du Lac Dock Spiders play at Marian College. I know very little about them except they have an absolutely awesome logo of an anthropomorphic baseball spider. But they're owned by the same group as the Timber Rattlers and if you're going between Appleton and Milwaukee it's right on the way.

Carson Park in Eau Claire is home to the Eau Claire Express of the Northwoods League. But also hosted a Braves farm club in the 1950s. Hank Aaron, Bob Uecker, and Joe Torre all played there. According to legend, Hark Aaron hit a ball on to the adjacent football field during an Eau Claire State (now UWEC) football game. 

Anyway, this was longer than I was expecting, but I think I gave you enough to start with lol",reddit,general madison
"Based on your criteria, Mount Horeb appears to be a very strong contender for the best retirement town in Wisconsin for you. Here's why:

Population: With a population of around 7,700, it falls comfortably within your preferred range.
Older Homes &amp; Price Range: While specific listings fluctuate, Mount Horeb has a charming downtown and surrounding residential areas with older homes, many dating back to the early 20th century or before. It's plausible to find homes with front porches in the $300-$700K range, though availability will vary.
Walkability: Mount Horeb has a walkable Main Street area with coffee shops, restaurants, bars, entertainment options, and grocery stores within reasonable walking distance of many residential areas.
Quiet and Safe: Notably, Mount Horeb was recently named the safest town in Wisconsin in the 2025 State of Safety in America rankings by Safewise.com. It reported zero murders and burglaries in the latest data.
Mature Trees: While not explicitly stated as a defining characteristic in all sources, smaller, established towns like Mount Horeb often feature mature trees in their neighborhoods, contributing to a pleasant environment.
Proximity to Madison: Mount Horeb is located roughly 20-30 minutes southwest of Madison, well within your 2-hour driving limit.
Why other towns might also be worth considering:

Oregon: Another town listed as one of the safest in Wisconsin and within a similar driving distance to Madison. It has a population around 11,800, slightly above your ideal range but still relatively small. You might find older homes here as well.
Stoughton: Located southeast of Madison, Stoughton has a population around 12,600. It has a historic downtown and some older architecture. It's also within a reasonable drive to Madison.
Monroe: Located further southwest of Madison (closer to the 1-hour mark), Monroe has a population around 10,800. It's known for its historic courthouse square and Swiss heritage, and you might find older homes with character here.

President Biden has taken a lot of heat from lawmakers in his own party for not being tough enough on Israel for its violence in Gaza and in East Jerusalem this month. Interestingly, my old boss President Ronald Reagan could not be accused of the same, and actually set a precedent for holding Tel Aviv to task, without breaking the special bond between the United States and Israel. It can be done.

President Biden certainly deserves credit for the role he and his administration played in getting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the Egyptian-brokered deal that led to a ceasefire in the 11-day war between Israel and Hamas. That violence was responsible for killing at least 250 Palestinians, including 63 children, and 12 Israelis, including two children, and injured tens of thousands of people primarily in Gaza. However, by blocking the draft UN Security Council statement that called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and refusing to back legislation sponsored by some 28 Democratic senators to block a $735 million package of precision-guided weapons to Israel, Biden risks undermining the role Washington can play in enhancing long-term prospects for peace in the region. 

While it is impossible to know exactly why Biden has taken these two steps, he is no doubt wary of the tremendous criticism he would get from most Republicans, some members of his own party, and the pro-Israel lobby, if he were to have done things any other way. He no doubt remembers the criticism that President Obama received from these three groups in 2016 when he failed to veto a UN resolution that demanded that Israel halt Jewish settlements in all Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, occupied since 1967. 

In fact, Obama was much more willing to veto UN resolutions condemning Israeli violence than the Republican presidents who preceded him, including Reagan and the two Bushes. President Reagan, for whom I had the honor of serving for four and a half years, actually allowed 21 UN resolutions that directly or indirectly condemned Israeli behavior and actions to pass. These included condemning Israel for the bombing of Lebanon, Iraq, and Tunisia. George H.W. Bush allowed nine UN resolutions, including one that criticized Israel for deporting Palestinians that it perceived as anti-Israel to pass, while George W. Bush allowed six more, including one that called on Israel to stop demolishing the houses of Palestinian civilians. Obama allowed only one UN resolutionagainst the expansion of the settlements to pass before leaving office in December 2016.

In addition to not vetoing UN resolutions, Reagan took several actions that many in Israel and the United States perceived as anti-Israel. For example, on June 7, 1981, less than six months after Reagan took office, Israel launched a surprise bombing raid on the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak, and, in so doing, violated the airspace of Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Reagan not only supported UNSC Resolution 487, which condemned the attack, but he also criticized the raid publicly and suspended the delivery of advanced F-16 fighter jets to Israel. Moreover, over the strident objections of Israel and the pro-Israel U.S. lobby groups, Reagan approved the sale of advanced reconnaissance aircraft (AWACS ) to Saudi Arabia, which Israel then viewed as a hostile state.

A year later, in August 1982, when Israeli forces advanced beyond southern Lebanon and began shelling the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in Beirut, Reagan responded with an angry call to Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, demanding a halt to the operation. 

In addition, during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Reagan intervened directly when Israel threatened to blow up the Commodore Hotel in downtown Beirut, which housed more than 100 western reporters. As David Ottaway, who was then the Washington Post Middle East correspondent and was in the building, pointed out, the Israeli defense minister did not like the media coverage the invasion was getting and wanted to close down the media center. 

Biden, on the other hand, even though he had an hour’s notice, failed to intervene to stop Netanyahu from bombing and collapsing the 12-story building that housed the offices of Al Jazeera and the Associated Press in Gaza during the recent bombing campaign. He also failed to publicly condemn the attack, let alone challenge Israel’s contention that the building sheltered Hamas military intelligence assets, despite AP’s insistence that its staff had no evidence that such assets were or ever had been present.

In addition to allowing the UN resolutions to pass and suspending the F-16 delivery, Reagan also restricted aid and military assistance to Israel to help force its withdrawal of troops from Beirut and central Lebanon.

Therefore, if in the future some members of the Biden administration or Congress want to join the international community in condemning Israel’s behavior, or in conditioning U.S. assistance or arms transfers and face resistance from Republicans, they need only point to the precedents established by President Reagan in the first instance.",reddit,downtown
"Belgian Delight is a cute little cafe with good breakfast. I enjoy going there. You know what, I haven’t seen mention of Belgian pie!!

Otherwise, around Appleton, there is Vince Lombardis Steak House, Nakashima of Japan, Pullmans at Trolley Square, or Fratellos Riverfront Restaurant. If you're looking to drink, College Ave has a lot of bars, and I would guess they have live music as well 🤷‍♀️ (I don't go out to bars, so I'm not sure what they all have going on lol although I'm sure you could google it and see) College Ave also has an amazing food truck, Diablos Tacos Truck, and they have excellent burritos and tacos. You can also do ax throwing on College Ave, I think you can drink there as well. High Cliff State Park is beautiful and has a lot of walking trails, I would not recommend swimming there as the water is quite dirty. Although if you don't mind a drive, Whitefish Dunes State Park in Door County is also beautiful with walking trails, and the water is clear and good to swim in, a little chilly though. It's 1hr 30min (for me), depending on where you are staying in Appleton. Door County also has a decent selection of restaurants. (I haven't been to any yet, but that's what I've heard lol) Also, Sensiba State Wildlife Area in Suamico has beautiful walking trails. It's about 38 minutes away, give or take. Bay Beach in Green Bay is like a mini amusement park with rides and food. They also have Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary. I would say Green Bay also has quite a few bars, and I'm guessing a live music scene, which you could look into. We also have Bird scooters in Appleton and the surrounding cities. Those can be a lot of fun to ride around on and explore. There's an app ""Bird"" that you can download that can help you locate scooters, and that's how you pay for them. There's also the Fox Trot Trail in Appleton. It's close to downtown. Bubolz Nature Preserve has walking trails that are close. If you like Bubble Tea/Boba, I recommend Jasmine Leaf in Appleton. (They are closed Sunday and Monday fyi) Asian Thai in Appleton has amazing Chinese food. (I think the dining room is closed, but you can get take out, that's what we always do lol) Goly &amp; Eve Puerto Rican Kitchen in Kimberly has excellent food.

It’s more of that town than farm land nearby but you would have everything you need. I saw another comment about Hartford which is not a bad area. Most of these towns meet that more farmer vibe.

With Ozaukee County, it is more expensive based on where you live (than Washington County). This is less of a farmer vibe for people as the towns are just outside of Milwaukee. More south toward Mequon, Cedarburg, Grafton, Port Washington have everything you would need and meet those suburb vibes. Cedarburg has a downtown with many places to eat and shops. With a town like Grafton nearby that is growing with adding new restaurants and shops. Mequon is a lot bigger but has everything. All these towns would be within 30-45 of the city. More north in Ozaukee county it’s smaller towns but can meet that more wood area vibes.

There are many of us who love animals and dogs and cats. You will find kindred spirits there for sure. There is a drinking culture here, but that is a lot of places imo. But you do not have to partake, I don't and I am no religious or anything. Lots of history here too. I love small town museums. There is a small town called Two Rivers north of Manitowoc near the GB area. There is a cute little museum there that shows how the early settlers there lived. They were fisherman.

Growing up in rural Western Wisconsin, farms and farmers were central to my community. From afterschool meetings of Future Farmers of America to my best friend’s complaints about having to milk cows every Sunday morning before church, agriculture was woven into daily life. After college, I worked for (now retired) [Congressman Ron Kind](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/06/former-u-s-rep-ron-kind-joins-d-c-law-firm-as-senior-policy-advisor/69863175007/) and was honored to do my part supporting his efforts in Washington to protect[ Wisconsin farmers' livelihoods](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/06/wisconsin-democrats-join-push-back-against-elon-musks-government-role/78248742007/).

I then went on to work in the U.S. intelligence community, where I was exposed to a global understanding of food and farming. I saw firsthand how food insecurity in Africa and the Middle East helped terrorists and extremists recruit hungry young men – and how [U.S. food aid](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/world/2025/02/12/usaid-list-spending-trump-musk-global-impact/78404374007/), which in large part comes from American farmers, could reverse this trend.

  
It is because of these life experiences that I am so concerned by the Trump Administration’s shortsighted effort to dismantle the [U.S. Agency for International Development](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/06/gwen-moore-confronted-speaker-mike-johnson-on-elon-musk/78299902007/) (USAID) and cut U.S. foreign aid, both of which harm Wisconsin agriculture and food security globally.

  
This action is a reversal of decades of [bipartisan support](https://hungercenter.org/blog/four-bipartisan-hunger-policy-achievements-in-2022/) for programs that provide global food aid and prevent starvation, precisely because such programs help American farmers, help those most in need, and prevent conflict and instability that threatens our national security.

  
American farmers, including Wisconsin farmers, have played a critical role in saving lives globally since the Food for Peace program was established by President John F. Kennedy. In 2024, USAID [purchased](https://www.redlakenationnews.com/story/2025/02/07/business/shuttering-of-usaid-could-mean-the-end-of-millions-in-income-for-midwest-farm-operations/128981.html) $2 billion in U.S.-grown crops for humanitarian aid, such as corn, soybeans, wheat, sorghum, vegetable oil and peas.

  
The University of Wisconsin-Madison is a key partner for USAID’s Feed the Future Innovation Lab, helping train agricultural researchers around the world and research new seeds. In the past decade, Feed the Future has [reduced hunger and poverty](https://wisconsinagconnection.com/news/usaid-invests-57-million-in-agricultural-innovation) by 20 to 25 percent in targeted areas, with over 6 million producers newly using better agricultural practices in 2023 alone.

Of course, these innovations not only support communities abroad, but can also be put to use right in UW-Madison’s backyard to make farmers more resilient to increasing hazards such as heatwaves and extreme precipitation.  

Right now, however, Feed the Future is [suspended](https://www.devex.com/news/devex-dish-shock-and-fear-for-food-programs-amid-us-aid-freeze-109199). A report from the USAID Inspector General released on Feb. 10 [found](https://admin.govexec.com/media/general/2025/2/usaid-oig---oversight-of-usaid-funded-humanitarian-assistance-programming-021025.pdf?__hstc=113921560.7754616a2e345bea0c9cb3d6e9925d3f.1736766621277.1738238241362.1739291119055.7&amp;__hssc=113921560.1.1739291119055&amp;__hsfp=867848667) that $489 million of food assistance at ports, in transit, and in warehouses, including food from Midwestern farmers is at risk of spoiling and diversion before it can be used to help hungry communities. Programs that leverage U.S. agricultural innovation to help small-scale farmers in East Africa and the Sahel have stopped, much to the [delight](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/world/europe/usaid-russia-putin.html) of extremist groups and U.S. adversaries Russia and China.

Should parts of USAID be reformed or revisited? Certainly. But shutting down the entire agency in less than two weeks is not the way to do it. I know Wisconsinites are proud of the role our farm industry plays in supporting food security and preventing starvation worldwide. The Wisconsin Congressional delegation has consistently stood up for Wisconsin farmers, and they must do the same today by opposing this reckless destruction of these life-saving and economically important food aid programs.",reddit,campus
"How's your rodent season going so far? Last year was my first winter in my home since moving out of an apartment with my wife. We live in Washington County where our neighbors are farm field to the North, South, and West, and our neighbor to the East had double digit acres.

I have an additional detached garage we call the workshop as well as a rotted shed designed like a mini barn we call the barn.

Last year when in the barn I spotted a mouse in there and I remember from my childhood living in upstate New York the issues with mice living in walls that I did not want to deal with them making way into the house so set some traps, caught two, and had no more issues. Later on in the winter though I eventually noticed some disturbed food in the basement and weird stuff on the floor that I foolishly touched... And have since learned was mouse droppings and not to touch. After setting traps and catching five in total the infestation seemed to have been dealt with. I also found what I believed was in the interest route and filled it. 

Well this year has been exhausting already after living in blissful ignorance for awhile. I'm assuming they migrated once the farm harvested all the soy this year. I spotted a mouse run for hiding in the workshop one day when riding back into the shop and realized a tremendous amount of mouse poop around certain areas. I checked the barn and there was a lot in there too.

So naturally I went ahead and setup traps in the shop and barn. The basement already had multiple traps setup from the previous winter still undisturbed. 

Well so far I'm up to 21 rodents now. 3 caught in the workshop, 2 in the basement, and 16 in the barn. Most have mice (Deer Mice?) but I also caught 2 Northern Short-Tailed Shrews after researching what the heck they were since they clearly weren't mice or moles.

After the basement ones I retraced the exterior for locations needing spray foaming to close gaps such as a sump discharge line and for dug holes. I've also been spraying a deterrent (peppermint, cinnamon, garlic mix I bought at Lowe's) around the shop and basement and exterior (but not barn) to reduce intrusion to my shop and house.

I bought a HEPA filter for my shop vac so I can eventually suck up the poop. The only sigh of relief I have is the two basement intruders I've had were quick catches because no poop there. I tried borescoping under the barn to see if there was a nest but no luck. And sure enough since I started checking around mouse 8 or so they've all been female. 

It's exhausting. I don't know if I'm winning or not or at least holding the line... But uhg.",reddit,general madison

All the little towns on the bay side have lots of touristy stuff to check out and there are a TON of parks to visit around. Peninsula park is pretty neat with the giant tower you can walk up. It even has a wheelchair ramp to be more accessible. 

Washington Island is neat to visit once. Take the ferry across and spend like 3-4 hours checking out the beaches, the Nordic church that's still in use, the giant Lavender field, and if you feel like joining the Bitters Club you can go to Nelsen's. Their food is actually pretty good and they make some good drinks. 

Also Door County coffee and tea company is pretty reasonably priced for a quick stop; depending on where you're driving to. And don't forget to visit the east side of Door County. The bay side gets all the love, but the lake side has some pretty sights as well. Just not as much to do.

"Wisconsin Agriculture &amp; Our Lakes Recently, there have been numerous discussions in the Madison subreddit about the issues facing Madison's lakes, particularly related to agricultural runoff. I wanted to provide some clear, factual information to help everyone better understand the challenges, the regulatory framework in place, and how being informed can empower us to protect these vital community resources. This post aims to clarify the situation, outline the existing policies, and highlight the steps being taken to address these concerns.

Madison's lakes, as well as all of the waters of our state, are a cherished part of our community, but they face significant challenges, particularly from agricultural runoff. Phosphorus, a key nutrient in farm fertilizers, is a major contributor to the eutrophication of these lakes. When excess phosphorus enters our waters, it promotes the growth of algae, leading to harmful algal blooms that degrade water quality, harm aquatic life, and limit recreational use.

Agricultural runoff is a primary source of this phosphorus. Rainwater or snowmelt flowing over fields can pick up fertilizers, manure, and soil particles, carrying them into nearby streams and rivers, which eventually feed into our lakes. This runoff not only deteriorates water quality but also contributes to sedimentation and habitat loss in our waterways. Additionally, legacy phosphorus in existing sediment continues to leach into the water, posing a substantial challenge even as conservation practices and reduced land applications are implemented.

Addressing the agricultural impact on our lakes requires a multi-faceted approach involving farmers, local government, and the broader community.

**Wisconsin's Policy Framework:**

* The DNR sets agricultural performance standards, such as soil erosion controls and requirements for nutrient management.
* DATCP provides technical guidance on how to meet these standards.
* County land conservation departments partner with the DNR and DATCP to implement these efforts locally. Some counties have adopted these standards into local ordinances, while others use programs like the Farmland Preservation Program. Soil and water conservation in Wisconsin is largely locally led and voluntary, rooted in a tradition dating back to the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Soil Conservation Service.

Unless there is a specific local set of ""teeth"" to enforce these performance standards, it ultimately falls back onto the DNR to enforce. And their ability to enforce is rather stretched thin - primarily focusing on visible direct discharges to waters of the state. As the saying goes ""If you see something, say something."" It's important to also know the difference between a manure spill and just regular land application of manure that meets standards so you don't waste the LCD or DNRs time reporting something that ultimately isn't an issue. 

**Land Conservation Department's Efforts:**

* Nutrient Management Plans (NMPs): These plans optimize fertilizer and manure use, ensuring nutrients are applied in the right amount, at the right time, and in ways that minimize runoff.
* Conservation Practices: Promoting the use of cover crops, buffer strips, and no-till farming to reduce soil erosion and runoff, keeping soil and nutrients in place to protect waterways.
* Cost-Share Programs: Offering financial assistance to farmers for adopting conservation measures, alongside additional resources from USDA-NRCS and DNR cost-share programs.
* Compliance Monitoring: Ensuring adherence to soil and water conservation standards outlined in DNR NR 151, including local ordinances and Farmland Preservation requirements. 
* Community Engagement: The department educates and involves the community through workshops, outreach initiatives, and public awareness campaigns, encouraging residents to protect our lakes. Farmers are encouraged to engage with groups like the Yahara Pride Watershed group.

How You Can Help:

* Support local conservation efforts.
* Advocate for stronger environmental policies.
* Practice responsible land use.",reddit,general madison

If you go to a pharmacy that is trying to charge you $800 for a brand name advair the problem is not the manufacturer charging too much, the problem is the pharmacy charging too much.

"Probably get banned for this as a resident of Wisconsin but can someone please explain why rooting out abuse and waste is a bad thing?  Should we not be trying to help people get back into the work force?

In my opinion the system as a safety net is inadequate, we need a safety trampoline instead.  A safety net catches you but leaves you on the net but a trampoline will give you the tools to bounce back out.  Shorter duration, much more intensive help in covering living expenses while training or re-training.  To do that we would need to run programs targeted and lean, squeeze a taxpayer buck for everything it is worth with no place for abuse, waste and fraud.

"Trouble with hotel in Dells So i had booked a small family vacation (our first ever, we are so excited and this is a HUGE deal for us, momentous, saved up for 2 years) and read the reviews, everything was great. I compared and pored over the net for any possible issues for weeks. There were none, and i liked staying with a local family owned place as opposed to a big corporate place. I happily booked our vacation 45 days in advance and set about sitting on my hands in excitement. 


Today, the day before our stay begins, i get an optional upgrade email stating the hotel doesn't offer any ""free passes"" although other emails state they are included in the resort fees, which i have paid. This means to attend the waterpark and theme park that was promised and the reason i booked this partucular hotel, which was pricier than many others, we would have to come out of pocket- now with zero notice or time to pay ahead online either- which would more than *triple* the cost of this trip. It is straight up -not possible- for us to do this. We don't have that much money set aside. I hoped maybe it's just a typo or something, surely they wouldn't yank the amenities after we have paid and have proof.

 They did. 


I looked at reviews again in a panic and noticed everyone that has stayed there in the past 2 months has had the exact same issue. No passes for anyone. Manager doesn't care, won't refund, too bad.  Furthermore, people have been waiting hours to get into their rooms past checkout time, the average is 3 hours. This will eat up a whole day of being able to do anything as everything seems to close around 5. Every hour here is highly valuable to us. 

Of course we are one day past the cancellation period, so this hotel stay is being paid for whether we go or not. The upgrade email is the only thing that said no passes offered, i have plenty of screenshots and emails saying they are part of our package. It was sneaky to wait until we couldn't cancel to send this email, and even sneakier to put it in the small print and hide it. I am PISSED.  I booked it through the choice priveleges system, They're in the choice-ascend hotels group. Apparently it was sold this year and the new owners are taking it down the tubes, pun intended. 


We will happily go to stay at a regular hotel that does offer the passes, of which there are many. But we can't pay for both.  I would need a rwfund or at least a partial refund to be able to do that. Does anyone have any advice on what to do here? I have tried calling the hotel numerous times and have left messages, no replies as of yet. It's not looking good. I can't bring my 6 year old to sit in a hotel all week long and look out at the waterslides she was supposed to go on. I am heartbroken.",reddit,general madison

I love in the Milwaukee area and I have an old P.O.S. car that the catalytic converter has clogged and doesn't work anymore. As a result, I'm pretty confident it'll fail the required emissions testing next year when it comes up. 

Can I simply register the car at my parent's place to avoid this? No emissions tests required in the past of the state they live. Is it even possible for the police or government to find out and fine me?",reddit,general madison

"Meet Ralph, Alice, Pebbles and BamBam (well... only Pebbles maybe), the Mourning Doves of Downtown Oregon, WI. I've lived in Oregon, WI for about four years in the same apartment, and in the first year I was here, a pair of mourning doves (who I read mate for life) built a nest on my balcony and had baby doves. I named the parents Ralph and Alice, and the two babies Pebbles and BamBam. Each spring/summer some of the family came back, hard to tell who or even the same family (although I Iike to think so.) I hadn't seen them this last summer and was pretty bummed out. I redesigned my balcony furniture and stuff, but couldn't bring myself to clean out the nest. 

Tonight, I had a friend over who was standing on the balcony and they said a bird kind of buzzed them (third floor, balcony and 6pm, not exactly a flight path.) Low and behold, I asked him leave the balcony empty for a few and look who I find sitting up in the nest.... I'm gonna say Pebbles is home, Ralph and Alice are hopefully enjoying retirement somewhere. Really awesome to have them back and thinking about them being safe and sound, instead of wondering if they were OK and if they found a new home. Sometimes the simplest, stupidest things can bring you joy. These mourning doves on my balcony make me smile, hope Pebbles makes you smile too.",reddit,downtown
"We’re a Journal Sentinel reporter and a Wisconsin legal expert here to answer questions about Wisconsin’s open records law in honor of Sunshine Week. AUA! Hey everyone! We’re Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter [Mary Spicuzza](https://www.jsonline.com/staff/2646785001/mary-spicuzza/) and [Wisconsin public records](https://www.wiopenrecords.com/) legal expert Tom Kamenick.

In celebration of Sunshine Week—a nonpartisan initiative highlighting the importance of public records and open government—we’re teaming up to address your open records questions in an AMA on Monday, March 17 at noon CT.

Here’s a little more about us:

I’m Mary Spicuzza (u/mary\_spicuzza), a political and investigative reporter at the Journal Sentinel, where I’ve filed hundreds of open records requests while covering local and state government.

I led the team that was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for breaking news coverage of then-Gov. Scott Walker’s move to sharply limit union powers. Among other honors, I won an Investigative Reporters and Editors award for my PBS FRONTLINE documentary about deaths at the U.S.-Mexico border. I recently investigated the murder of her cousin, who was killed by a car bomb in downtown Milwaukee. Here’s some of my recent work:

Since starting the project in 2019, I have litigated 45 access cases with a 90%+ win rate. I have written over 200 letters objecting to illegal government behavior and provided pro bono advice to individuals, media organizations and advocacy groups. Here are some of my recent cases (*Full disclosure: Kamenick has worked with the Journal Sentinel on some cases*):

"Looking to help a struggling friend in WI A friend who lives in Marathon City, WI is struggling and despite trying to get help, keeps hitting barriers. She was very recently dumped by her longterm bf who took basically everything they co-owned and blamed her worsening disability as the reason for the break up.

I think she is coming across difficulties as a lot of charities and grants have conditions that preclude her from receiving assistance for different issues like, heating, mold removal, weatherisation, pet food.

I think she is exhausted by the rejection and getting depressed by lack of any positive news; I thought maybe I could try to do some research re possible help in her state, WI, hence my post here.  
I am in TX and do not have experience with dealing with govt agencies or charities, I understand they have preclusions etc but remain optimistic that there are resources that may be able to help her.

Im also an immigrant so not sure how it works in the US, but back home, if you are low-income and requiring assistance, you could be assigned a social worker who would have access and knowledge of the different assistance programs and help navigate them. Is that how it works here? If so, how would my friend be able to meet with a social worker in WI?

This is the list of what afaik she has tried and the reasons she doesnt qualify for assistance.

She is disabled and unemployed.   
Has an elderly (14) sick (epileptic and major allergies) chihuahua  
lives in a mobile home (she owns it). The mobile home has extensive mold due to major water damage from water leaks in the roof. The mobile home needs roof repair, mold removal and weatherisation. 

Her main concerns are to have a safe place to live and food for her dog.

What she has tried so far:

Her family has not been supportive and due to her isolation due to her worsening disabilities, has had difficulty maintaining friendships, therefore no real support system.  
  
Has tried [WHEAP](https://energyandhousing.wi.gov/Pages/AgencyResources/energy-assistance.aspx), Wisconsin Home Energy Assistance Program. Was refused assistance for weatherisation or energy bills because her furnace runs on natural gas.  
Tried to get a loan to fix her house; fine print says *no roofing repairs*  
Apparently, once weather becomes cold, rubber wont seal anymore so weatherisation is urgent.  
Tried to get a W[heda loan](https://www.wheda.com/) but was refused as mobile home is in mobile park and not on private land.  
  
Tried dog food pantries, but turned down, as her dog is on vet-prescribed food because of his allergies. 

It might end up being better for her to move, at least for the winter, but I want to try to present her with any other resources that she might have not tried.

Thank you all for the long read.",reddit,general madison

"I would say safety and respect first. Once you start pointing at a minority and blame them for everything that is the real issue. 

I would also say that Fox News, politicians, influencers (aka attention seekers) and political pundits have done a great job at amplifying a non-issue for political gain.

If you quizzed older or misinformed people they would describe being transgender as being a transvestite. They think that the last guy on the tennis team can claim to identify as a woman overnight, join the women’s team and get a gold medal along with a full ride scholarship at Harvard.

Of course that narrative takes so many shortcuts and skips so much logic that is laughable but sadly it works.

Obviously Olympic gold medals for women and full ride scholarships did not all go to transgender athletes but rage bait works really well to rile up voters. 

Even on the guy who does not have kids nor is an athlete. My gym and the Olympics figured out who could compete in which category - it is pretty simple to set rules.

"You got it.  this took 30 seconds
Just moved here from the Lower 48 for work, and wow—Alaska. What a dream. A cold, dark, wildly inconvenient fever dream with a marketing team so good they’ve convinced half the country that this place is “majestic” instead of what it actually is: a snow-covered punishment for people who hate comfort, light, and the concept of being within an hour of anything.

You think this place is beautiful? Sure—if your idea of scenic is staring into the icy void while your eyelashes freeze together and a moose stares you down like you owe it money. People here act like the wilderness is some magical, healing force. It’s not. It’s a death maze full of apex predators and 9-month winters. The “great outdoors” here is just a never-ending audition for Alone, except no prize money and the bears aren’t CGI.

Oh, and let’s talk about sunlight. Or lack thereof. “It builds character,” they say—right after popping their third vitamin D pill of the morning and crying into a full-spectrum lamp. You get maybe four months of daylight, and in return, you’re eaten alive by mosquitoes the size of sparrows. Real bargain.

Culturally? It’s pioneer cosplay meets paranoia. People romanticize “living off the land” while shopping at Costco like it’s the apocalypse. Everyone drives trucks big enough to tow the moon, yet half the roads are impassable and the other half are just vaguely paved ideas. Try having a conversation about literally anything besides hunting, fishing, or generators and you’ll get a stare so blank it echoes.

So why does anyone stay? That’s the real mystery. Maybe they lost a bet. Maybe they like suffering. Or maybe they’ve just gone too long without a normal climate, a decent coffee shop, or a Target, and Stockholm syndrome has taken hold.

Either way, welcome to Alaska—the state that dares you to call it “home” while it slowly, methodically eats your soul with a smile and a snowstorm.",reddit,general madison

"Primer of Food Pathways. Parts 1 to 5 Part 1: Food Pathways

Food is a primal need. Supply disruptions (by environment or economy) result in scarcity.

Pathways vary from time to place, yet always address a community need. Skills of independence and interdependence form a safety net. Yet, these are the very things industry has sought to erode.

To sever us from knowledge, history, community, and understanding is by design. Industry is well-rehearsed in a collection of mythologies that run counter to, and conflict with, our very nature. ""Generosity is fool-hearty, relationships are transactions. Food is a mystery; now, will this be cash or credit?""

To hunt, gather, cook, make, heal are life skills. Foundational skills that industry calls ""obsolete hobbies"".

It is the industrialist's job to lie. Their century-old framework continues to rust, to spite every coat of fresh paint.

The pathways are an ancient tree, reaching skyward. Thousands of branches. Seek out the pathways, and grow, so all may thrive.

Part 2: Fortify Against Scarcity

A. Shelf stable staples. Low cost items to stretch dishes and add nutritional value. (Pasta, rice, beans, potatoes, broth.) The Petty Herbalist podcast dives deeper into food, nutrition, and resiliency.

B. Recipes, from times of scarcity and creativity. For example, dandelion was used during the Great Depression (yes, dandelion).

C. Growing (vast topic) Alliums and potatos are notorious for sprouting, indoors, mid-winter. It's annoying, but congrats on the new plant 🎉 🥳 🎉. Don't trash them, they will yield a harvest with minimal effort.

D. Foraging. Alexis Nikole aka Blackforager provides excellent coverage on safety, identification, harvest techniques, and uses.

E. Animal and mushroom hunting, fishing, livestock and animal husbandry, all valid skills. (However, I do not have enough understanding to speak on these topics, so I will not).

Think of these as sign posts and not the journey. Many hours of digital media and library books await you. (It is very ""choose your own adventure"".)

Part 3✨ Intermission ✨

When food is on the table and medicine in the cabinet, we do not question the exchange. Yet, in recent years, it has become hard not to question: How can 'essential' work not be fair pay? How can an algorithm deem medical care 'optional'? With everything happening, it's easy to feel out-of-sorts.

Yet, we are the descendants of perilous times. Every war and famine. Every bountiful harvest and Dust Bowl.

Of food scarcity, there is no crystal ball. It cannot be prevented, only guarded against.

Monoculture is the beach-body of growing methods. Visually pleasing, but expensive to maintain. More attractive are permaculture models. Such as WW2 Victory Gardens, First Nation's 3-Sisters, and Hugelkulture.

Pollinators, custodians, mycelium networks; all positives. Synthetic sprays and chemical fertilizer; ironically not, as it damages the former.

Winter is a wonderful time to plan ahead. To discuss things like small space growing and ways to obtain seeds.

Part 4: Of Seeds &amp; Roots

📚Some public libraries host free seed events.

🌱Some stores have seed packets &amp; mushroom kits that are EBT eligible (but not always).

Most plants spread by seed or root. Sometimes both. (Very few, very 🦕old🦖plants use spores).

🛒Not all, but many potatoes, alliums, tomatoes, peppers, and squash found in the produce department will sprout. YouTube has tutorials on how to do this.

🌳Trees take years to produce. Many established, but overlooked trees grow nearby. Such as mulberry, crabapple, maple, oak, and walnut.

🌿(Bring us a shrubbery)🌿 Berries grow on bushes, canes and vines. Compound berries, like raspberries, have no toxic look-alikes this far North. However, there are toxic berries out there, such as nightshade and pokeweed.

🍃Many seeds arrive free on the wind. Wild plants are useful and resilient. When lettuce bolts under summer sun, lambsquarter grows strong. Chickweed remains evergreen under snowfall.

🦋You start with seeds, and if you are not careful, you end up with a haven. (Bumblebees drunk on primrose, skillful spiders, curious chickedees, chatty catbirds. Phantom deer that turn out to be a groundhog. A Hummingbird Moth that is practically a Pokemon. You have a plan to grow certain plants, for food or medicine, but it quickly goes beyond that.)

Part 5 🪴Growing Spaces🪴

Indoors : Windowsill, counter top, table, bookshelf. Many plants can start growing indoors, with a little light, soil, and water. (However, this is difficult if your 🐈 likes to experiment with things/gravity.)

Vertical &amp; Hanging: often used for climbing and cascading plants. (Pole beans happily climb nearby sticks/string. Strawberry towers are used to grow more in limited spaces. Tomatoes can be kept in hanging baskets, to deter squirrels)

Raised Beds: Each type has benefits and drawbacks. Common builds are Keyhole, Spiral, Straw Bale, 5 Gallon, and Hugelkultur. 

Victory Gardens (1940s) and Kitchen Gardens (1600s) were common in their time. Yet, the strongest growing method in North American was created by First Nations. For 3,000 years, Three Sisters has withstood the test of time.

Many cities have (or have potential for) community and school gardens. Providing access and nutrition in an otherwise gridlocked landscape. 🌳https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_gardening 🌳

"Wisconsin. Who’s your NHL team and why? I have moved around practically my entire life, so I have never had a “home team” in anything really. I stayed in the DMV area of the US for awhile, so I stuck to them for sports I was into as a kid. But now I’m an adult who really frickin’ *loves* hockey, just have no real *love* felt for any team yet.

I’m settling down and moving to Milwaukee Wisconsin at some point soon, and wanted to know who in the dairyland rocks with what teams. Namely for fun, but also so I know who may have some local bar places to check out once I settle in. Camaraderie is cool! 

I’m a free agent for fandom, no family of mine really cares for it and I’m admittedly new to being a serious fan, but that won’t stop me from belligerently defending a sports team until I’m blue in the face.

"What Chat GPT thinks of Madison I asked Chat GPT to ""Roast Madison, Wisconsin"". 

&gt;  
Ah, Madison, Wisconsin—the place where the cows outnumber the people, but the people still manage to be the most confused about where they’re from. It's like a college town where the university is both the biggest thing in town *and* the thing no one wants to admit they’re part of. You have the Capitol building, sure, but no one’s really sure what’s going on in there—except maybe people trying to decide if it's too cold to bike to work.

&gt;And let’s not forget the ""progressive"" reputation—Madison is like that friend who wears a hemp shirt and talks about yoga, but ends up running on 100% coffee and protesting at every chance. If you’re not participating in the latest local food trend or environmental cause, what *are* you doing with your life? It’s like a perpetual ""find yourself"" retreat.

&gt;Then there’s the weather. Oh, the weather! The air is a fine mix of snow, ice, and wind. One minute you’re basking in a semi-warm sun, and the next, it’s a full-on blizzard. You could be wearing shorts, and then—bam!—polar vortex. It's like Mother Nature’s way of keeping people on their toes—or just making sure no one ever gets used to anything.

&gt;And the locals—oh boy. Madison folks will give you the rundown on the best local brewery or the best lake to kayak in about 5 seconds. But they’re always a little too proud of their “underdog” sports teams, considering the Badgers’ lack of national titles. It’s cute, though—they believe, and in a town like Madison, that’s half the battle.

&gt;But hey, despite all the quirks, there’s still something oddly charming about it. Just don’t ask for directions unless you’ve got an hour to spare, and prepare for the never-ending battle between “nice” and “midwestern nice.”",reddit,downtown
"Tomorrow you are also voting for Tim Walz! 💙 Here’s Tim Walz VP acceptance speech, such a great man!

Wow. Thank you. Thank you, first of all, to Vice President Harris. Thanks for putting your trust in me and for inviting me to be part of this incredible campaign. And a thank you to President Joe Biden for four years of strong, historic leadership.

It’s the honor of my life to accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States. We’re all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason: We love this country.

So thank you to all of you here in Chicago and all of you watching at home tonight. Thank you for your passion. Thank you for your determination. And most of all, thank you for bringing the joy to this fight.

Now, I grew up in Butte, Nebraska, a town of 400 people. I had 24 kids in my high school class, and none of them went to Yale. But I’ll tell you what: Growing up in a small town like that, you learn how to take care of each other. That family down the road, they may not think like you do, they may not pray like you do, they may not love like you do—but they’re your neighbors, and you look out for them, and they look out for you.

Everybody belongs, and everybody has a responsibility to contribute. For me, it was serving in the Army National Guard. I joined up two days after my 17th birthday, and I proudly wore our nation’s uniform for 24 years. My dad, a Korean War-era Army veteran, died of lung cancer a couple years later. He left behind a mountain of medical debt. Thank God for Social Security survivor benefits. And thank God for the G.I. Bill that allowed my dad and me to go to college and millions of other Americans.

Eventually, like the rest of my family, I fell in love with teaching. Three out of four of us married teachers. I wound up teaching social studies and coaching football at Mankato West High School. Go Scarlets!

We ran a 4-4 defense, we played through to the whistle on every single play, and we even won a state championship. Never close the yearbook, people. But it was those players and my students who inspired me to run for Congress. They saw in me what I had hoped to instill in them: a commitment to the common good, an understanding that we’re all in this together, and the belief that a single person can make a real difference for their neighbors.

So there I was: a 40-something high school teacher with little kids, zero political experience, and no money, running in a deep-red district. But you know what? Never underestimate a public school teacher. Never.

I represented my neighbors in Congress for 12 years, and I learned an awful lot. I learned how to work across the aisle on issues like growing the rural economies and taking care of veterans. And I learned how to compromise without compromising my values. Then I came back to serve as Governor, and we got right to work making a difference in our neighbor’s lives.

We cut taxes for the middle class. We passed paid family and medical leave. We invested in fighting crime and affordable housing. We cut the cost of prescription drugs and helped people escape the kind of medical debt that nearly sank my family. And we made sure that every kid in our state gets breakfast and lunch every day. So while other states were banning books from their schools, we were banishing hunger from ours.
We also protected reproductive freedom, because, in Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the personal choices they make. And even if we wouldn’t make those same choices for ourselves, we’ve got a golden rule: Mind your own damn business.

And that includes IVF and fertility treatments. And this is personal for Gwen and I. If you’ve never experienced the hell that is infertility, I guarantee you, you know somebody who has. And I can remember praying each night for a phone call—the pit in your stomach when the phone would ring, and the absolute agony when we heard the treatments hadn’t worked. It took Gwen and I years, but we had access to fertility treatments, and when our daughter was born, we named her Hope.

Hope, Gus, and Gwen—you are my entire world, and I love you.

I’m letting you in on how we started a family, because this is a big part about what this election is about: freedom.

When Republicans use the word “freedom,” they mean that the government should be free to invade your doctor’s office. Corporations—free to pollute your air and water. And banks—free to take advantage of customers. But when we Democrats talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love. Freedom to make your own health care decisions. And yeah, your kids’ freedom to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in the hall.

Look, I know guns. I’m a veteran. I’m a hunter. And I was a better shot than most Republicans in Congress, and I got the trophies to prove it. But I’m also a dad. I believe in the Second Amendment, but I also believe our first responsibility is to keep our kids safe.
That’s what this is all about: the responsibility we have to our kids, to each other, and to the future that we’re building together—in which everyone is free to build the kind of life they want. 

But not everyone has that same sense of responsibility. Some folks just don’t understand what it takes to be a good neighbor.
Take Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. Their Project 2025 will make things much, much harder for people who are just trying to live their lives. They spend a lot of time pretending they know nothing about this. But look, I coached high school football long enough to know—and trust me on this—when somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, they’re going to use it. 

And we know, if these guys get back in the White House, they’ll start jacking up the costs on the middle class, they’ll repeal the Affordable Care Act, they’ll gut Social Security and Medicare, and they will ban abortion across this country, with or without Congress.

Here’s the thing: It’s an agenda nobody asked for. It’s an agenda that serves nobody except the richest and the most extreme amongst us. And it’s an agenda that does nothing for our neighbors in need.

Is it weird? Absolutely. Absolutely. But it’s also wrong, and it’s dangerous. 
It’s not just me saying so—it’s Trump’s own people. They were with him for four years. They’re warning us that the next four years will be much, much worse. 

You know, when I was teaching, every year we’d elect a student body president, and you know what? Those teenagers could teach Donald Trump a hell of a lot about what a leader is. Leaders don’t spend all day insulting people and blaming others. Leaders do the work.
So I don’t know about you, I’m ready to turn the page on these guys. So go ahead, say it with me: We’re not going back.

We’ve got something better to offer the American people. It starts with our candidate, Kamala Harris.

From her first day as a prosecutor, as a District Attorney, as an Attorney General, as a United States Senator and then our Vice President—she’s fought on the side of the American people. She’s taken on the predators and fraudsters. She’s taken down the transnational gangs. And she stood up to powerful corporate interests. She has never hesitated to reach across that aisle if it meant improving your lives. And she’s always done it with energy, with passion, and with joy.

Folks, we’ve got a chance to make Kamala Harris the next President of the United States. 
But I think we owe it to the American people to tell them exactly what she’d do as President before we ask them for their votes. So here, this is the part—clip and save it and send it to your undecided relatives, so they know: If you’re a middle class family or a family trying to get into the middle class, Kamala Harris is going to cut your taxes. If you’re getting squeezed by prescription drug prices, Kamala Harris is going to take on Big Pharma. If you’re hoping to buy a home, Kamala Harris is going to help make it more affordable. And no matter who you are, Kamala Harris is going to stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead. Because that’s what we want for ourselves, and it’s what we want for our neighbors.

You know, you might not know it, but I haven’t given a lot of big speeches like this. But I have given a lot of pep talks. So let me finish with this: Team, it’s the fourth quarter, we’re down a field goal, but we’re on offense and we’ve got the ball. We’re driving down the field. And, boy, do we have the right team.

Kamala Harris is tough, Kamala Harris is experienced, and Kamala Harris is ready. 

Our job—our job for everyone watching—is to get in the trenches and do the blocking and tackling: one inch at a time. One yard at a time, one phone call at a time, one door knock at a time, one $5 donation at a time. 

Look, we got 76 days. That’s nothing. There’ll be time to sleep when you’re dead. We’re going to leave it on the field.

That’s how we’ll keep moving forward. That’s how we’ll turn the page on Donald Trump. That’s how we’ll build a country where workers come first, health care and housing are human rights, and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom. That’s how we make America a place where no child is left hungry, where no community is left behind, where nobody gets told they don’t belong. That’s how we’re going to fight, and as the next President of the United States always says, “When we fight—” (Crowd responds: “We win!”) “When we fight—” (Crowd responds: “We win!”) “When we fight?” (Crowd responds: “We win!”)

"Vote April 1st Vote April 1^(st) for State Supreme Court and other offices and referendum.

Wisconsin is hurtling toward another nationally watched, pivotal state Supreme Court election. Your vote will determine the future course of the state. ([https://wisconsinwatch.org/2025/01/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-liberal-conservative-crawford-schimel-hagedorn/](https://wisconsinwatch.org/2025/01/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-liberal-conservative-crawford-schimel-hagedorn/))

Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Ann Walsh Bradley’s term will expire on July 31, 2025 and she is not seeking re-election. Ann is part of the 4-3 majority that currently makes up the court.

Susan Crawford is a judge for Branch 1 of the Dane County Circuit Court in Wisconsin, and her term ends on August 1, 2030. Crawford is running for election for judge of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Susan is endorsed by all 4 Democratic justices. [https://ballotpedia.org/Susan\_Crawford\_(Wisconsin)](https://ballotpedia.org/Susan_Crawford_(Wisconsin)).

Following her service in state government, Judge Crawford became a private practice attorney, where she protected voting and workers’ rights, and represented Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin to defend access to reproductive health care. [https://www.crawfordforwi.com/about](https://www.crawfordforwi.com/about).

A win for Susan Crawford will maintain the progressive majority we need to continue improving the lives of all Wisconsinites. Supreme Court seats held by Republicans will be up for election in 2026 &amp; 2027. Watch the debate between Susan Crawford and Brad Shimel live on March 12^(th) at 7:00PM ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVU\_KY5h9ms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVU_KY5h9ms))

**Voter eligibility** referendum will be on the ballot. IMO the referendum is poorly written to confuse the voter. I strongly encourage a **No** vote. [(https://my.lwv.org/wisconsin/april-2025-amendment-vote-no)]((https:/my.lwv.org/wisconsin/april-2025-amendment-vote-no)).

**State Superintendent:** your options are Jill Underly (**my choice**) and Brittany Kinser.

Jill is the current superintendent and as far as I can tell she has been doing the best she can. Huge state-wide budget cuts to the education system have given her a bad rap but she has our state’s children’s well-being as her highest priority. She has been an educator for years and is known to be very respected in her community. Jill is supported by Democrats.

As far as I can tell, Brittany pretty much wants to turn the Wisconsin education system into her personal money-making adventure. She works or has worked for an educational consulting firm, whatever that is. Brittany is supported by Republicans.

The February 18th primary results; Jill Underly 177,372; Brittany Kinser 161,576; &amp; Jeff Wright 128,446. ***The key is to get Jeff’s votes into Jill’s column.***

There will be school board races in many counties. **Please** do some research for your district. School boards are where the MAGA cancer starts.

Here's the list of books that were banned at my child's high school and why I care about it so much. They gave us no details as to why any of these were banned, only that they ""violated the policy"".

* ""A Court of Frost and Starlight"" by Sarah J. Maas
* ""A Court of Mist and Fury"" by Sarah J. Maas

* ""A Court of Wings and Ruin"" by Sarah J. Maas

* ""Tricks"" by Ellen Hopkins
* ""What Girls Are Made Of"" by Elana Arnold
* ""Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West"" by Gregory Maguire
* ""You: A Novel"" by Caroline Kepnes

I wouldn't call ""Gender Queer"" ""hardcore porn"", but it's one of the few that I could agree with being banned due to it being targeted to 16+. Maybe try reading the book though, so you can see what it is actually about.

""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" has some scenes where the high school is performing a PG version of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" where some of the boys dress in drag. So that is 100% why that one was banned. Funny thing is that they watched the movie version in health and wellness class.

The Bible is very sexual explicit and violent in the Old Testament. You're Ok with children reading those parts of the Bible?

Can you provide examples of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""Of Mice and Men"" and ""Huckleberry Finn"" actually being banned? From my recollection, there was only a handful of cases where people were requesting those books be banned, but they were never actually banned.

Edit: I should mention that I'm OK with not allowing most of those books in elementary/middle schools since they deal with some more mature topics at times. High Schoolers, being older, are more capable of handling those topics.",reddit,atwood

She took an interest in dystopian universes as well as dictatorship regimes, that is the premise that started the novel. 

If you could kindly post a link to your source of information, I would be very interested in reading it. I don’t mind being proven wrong as long as it is factually based.

"Thinking Of Moving Here Hi everyone! I am a 16 year old young lady with my mother and trans ftm brother who is 15 years old. We also have one dog who is a pitbull lab mix named Angel, and 2 cats with one being a Siamese mix (Stone) and the other being a regular black cat (Reaper). All 3 of the animals are registered as ESA (emotional support animals), fixed, and up to date on all their vaccinations. My family and I have been having some trouble since we came up to the north from Alabama, (We are originally from Alabama and grew up there our whole life, we left due to financial and societal problems.) At first, we came to northern Minnesota in Roseau for my mom to get a job at the company Polaris. Then mom got a job at another company called Marvins, and that’s when she met Jacob (I’m using a fake name for him). We ended up moving away from Roseau to Warroad, a small town. We had some issues with Jacob’s family, his family being quite misogynistic, homophobic and transphobic, which was not good for me, my brother, or my mother. On top of that Jacob already had a little daughter that he lost primary custody of due to addiction, he even went back to addiction. In the end, Jacob chose his family over us and left us with high bills that neither my mom or my brother could afford to pay in Warroad. We packed our animals, got up, and took off for North Dakota Fargo instead, and there my mother suffered a miscarriage with Jacob’s baby. Fargo has been just terrible to us, we spent 6 months in homelessness with our animals, going to a total of 2 shelters during our time, and the only way we escaped homelessness was moving into a cruel lady’s basement where we discovered she was a child abuser and treated us and our mother poorly. She kicked us out eventually and we were on the brink of being forced into the streets as all the shelters were full. We informed our school and they helped us get a low income apartment, but my mother is still struggling with finance and jobs, and the state refuses to give us food stamps, acting unprofessional in their reasons such as bringing up wages that don’t exist, and incorrect spellings of companies my mom has worked at like calling Applebees “Applefar”. (I’m not kidding they literally referred to Applebees as Applefar which makes them sound extremely unprofessional and almost something a scam company would say.) My mom has always wanted to move to Wisconsin, but I’m here to gather information on the state first. Is Wisconsin a blue or red state? Is abortion legal? Is there gender affirming healthcare for my brother? Does the state mind if we’re not Christian? How does the state feel about single mothers? How does the state feel about LGBTQ+ in general? Is the state extremely expensive? How much does a typical job pay? What can we do for something low income to live at while we save money? (My mother absolutely refuses to go in another homeless shelter so shelters aren’t an option) Is the state okay with our dog Angel even though she’s a pitbull lab mix? Is there public transit in case our car breaks down? If our car does break down are there resources or churches to help with repairs? Considering all my questions, where do you think the best place in the state for us to go to would be at? Or, would we be better off finding another state to move to considering all our needs? I’m here to gather both the pros and the cons, so don’t be afraid to let me know about some of the flaws of the state as well as some of the good things. I hope I get the answers I need for my family, thank you all for your time.",reddit,general madison

&gt;Shortly after Trumps assassination attempt failed. Biden stepped down after he seemingly was adamant about running. That was a coup. They new Biden wouldn't win so they installed Kamala.

I've addressed this multiple times on this site, as have countless other people. Look up the word coup before throwing it around. If you don't care to: ""a sudden, violent, and unlawful seizure of power from a government.""  Not what happened.

Biden saw the uphill battle ahead, partially from people just like me who thought he was too old to be POTUS the first time, let alone for a second term. And people like me that actually knew some of his voting history and disagreed with much of it. I wish he had stepped down in time for a proper primary, but he didnt. That's fact. Trying to hold a primary last minute when State deadlines were looming was essentially impossible. Given the factual events and timeline, I was content with the DNC nominating Harris. The DNC had every right and ability to nominate literally whoever they wanted, and they chose a person whom I and every other person who voted for the Biden/Harris ticket already voted for once. See my above feelings about Biden for my sentiments regarding Harris. It changed nothing when the alternative was Trump.
&gt;Call me a conspiracy theorist. I'm just a truth seeker. My opinions are subject to change when I discover new evidence. Unlike the left, they hold onto things, never admit wrong, and spout blatant lies. 

Whew ok lad. I've been got, right? You're trolling now? I guess I'll just say that ""when I discover new evidence"" is doing a fuck-ton of heavy lifting in that statement - and it'd apparantly be more accurate to say ""**if** I discover new evidence"" considering your propensity to assume. Do you seek new evidence, or only change your opinions when your chosen news source tells you to? If you seek evidence, please provide the evidence I asked for above regarding the 10 people sent to Gitmo. Again, I looked for evidence. If those 10 people have actually commited crimes worthy of a terrorist label, I will be happy they're in Gitmo now. I'm asking you to confirm your assumptions and rest my mind that those 10 people deserve to be there - will you do so or no?

&gt;As for the waste, fraud, and abuse. Did you see how many people were still getting paid social security that should've been in the guiness book of world records? Do you think 50 million dollars for condoms is a good way to spend our tax dollars? Do you think we should be giving money and shelter to illegals when people affected by floods only get a one time payment of 700? Sesame street for people in Iraq? Don't you think we could be spending that money in a better way? None of this would've come to light if Kamala won. Get off your high horse and come down to reality for a moment. 

I'm getting tired of doing these one by one, so rapid fire time:

Did you see that the database used by the Social Security Administration defaults to those ages?

Did you think about how that database handles those receiving survivor's benefits? Does it keep the name and age of the original beneficiary while updating who actually receives the money? Living spouses and children are in fact legally entitled to those benefits as far as I'm aware; have you considered any of that?

Did you ask for or look for justification for spending money on condoms? Considering the current discourse around abortion, I'm personally fine with my tax dollars supporting family planning services. I couldn't tell you off the top of my head how much supplying people with condoms should cost, but if it prevents unwanted pregnancies and abortions I'm willing to spend quite a bit on it.

Do you think providing basic necessities is an either or scenario? Either the scary illegals are treated like human beings, or those affected by floods are? Do you think removing funding from one automatically means the other gets more funding? I think Congress would disagree, just saying.

Did you stop and ask *why* Sesame Street in Iraq? A country that has been war-torn for decades, in no small part due to Republicans voting to invade Iraq under the makeshift guise of ""weapons of mass destruction""? [Doubt me? Here's the official proof from congress.gov since I just brought this up earlier today.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-joint-resolution/114/all-actions?q=%7B%22roll-call-vote%22%3A%22all%22%7D)  Maybe building relations in the Country that we invaded and then wanted help from is a worthy use of tax dollars, unless of course you prefer that Country to be hostile and send US troops home in body bags where tax dollars would be spent on their funerals instead?

Once again, pot, meet kettle. If I'm on any sort of high horse it's because I've done my due diligence. I purposely avoid news and shit, and am extremely critical of sources. I **will** bring the evidence to back up my claims when doubted. And I **will** always continue to question my pre-conceived notions. You're here openly admitting that you just assume things, and telling me I'm on a high horse for not just burying my head in the sand. Get over yourself AND Trump/Musk ffs. Your loyalty is not recipricated.

&gt;Trump is not a Saint. I'm not a Saint. You aren't a Saint. He's just the man who's going to get the job done. The job of fixing this country. You can't get nitpicky when it comes to overthrowing the deepstate. Ran by globalists who have got you right in the palm of their hand. 

Sure. Your first three sentences are accurate at least. But Trump and Musk are the very embodiment of a deepstate. And you say globalists like that's an inherently bad thing. I for one welcome with open arms the idea of a unified Earth. It's a fuckin pipe dream, but not the worst one I've heard of by a long shot. And certainly better than the nationalistic bullshit that Trump spews.",reddit,general madison
"&gt; They could turn from the wall street investors that the Democratic party has courted lately and return to a more worker focused platform.

That was like, Tim Waltz's job on the ticket.  Did you see videos of him talking to people on the campaign trail?  The guy just oozes blue collar charm.

Also, Sherrod Brown.  We lost one of our best hidden gems last year, he was genuinely an old school labor leftie making it work politically, in Ohio of all places.

Your analysis with Covid timing is probably right; it is unlikely that Hillary had the gumption to shut down borders right away, against WHO recommendation, which would've been turned into a MAGA talking point that Killary killed a million Americans.  Regardless of how much better the rest of the response was.

In Texas that doesn’t happen. Places like Austin, Houston, San Antonio, etc have breweries and bars galore but you can still count (roughly) how many bars there are here. Most small towns (let’s call a small town under 10,000 people for arguments sake) in Wisconsin have double digit bars.

"Today is the day folks!! Let’s protest no matter what of the 30+ events you're attending across the state today, make it impactful and safe. 

I have appreciated working with each and every one of you. I am grateful for the connections and family we have built, and I am even grateful for the conflicts and barriers weve been met with, because we have continuously learned, grown, and overcome. 

Today we wake up with bigger fire in our hearts, and a big mission. 

Be sure you turn to your neighbor and a stranger, ask them how they are doing, how they can be supported, or what their story is. 

For many of us, this isn't our first rodeo, but there are far more people who will be joining us in the streets for the first time, and we need to make sure they know they are welcome, loved, and cared for in this community. 

We got this. All of us. Together",reddit,general madison

"I live in Eau Claire, today's high is - 1 and the real feel is - 27. Fortunately im off work today so I just haven't gone outside. That said, I've been outside in colder, after a bit your body gets used to it. You'll find that investing in some quality jackets is worth the price. Layers can be especially beneficial.
I wouldn't want to live anywhere without 4 seasons, a snow less winter would feel weird to me. Eau Claire is a pretty nice city if that's where you wind up, it's very accepting and open. The city is a pretty liberal hub for the region of the state and has a lot of focus on arts and education. Healthcare is a pretty big industry as well but has been going through some major changes as of late. Home to University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire helps to give the city a youthful and busy feel around downtown and Water Street during much of the year. It does also mean some neighborhoods are dominated by college students - which has its own plusses and minuses. Downtown has seen a ton of new investment lately which have brought in new residents and businesses; overall I think the city has a healthy vibe and is a generally nice place to live. I'm from the Chicago suburbs, so the temperature adjustment was not very severe for me, but it does trend a bit colder for longer of the year. Most people up here have some degree of vitamin D defiency in the winter so prepare for that coming from Texas, and you should be fine.  The summers are amazing here, not too hot or humid most days, good for grabbing a tube and floating down the river, going for hikes, boating, cliff jumping, Frisbee golf, regular golf. Summer nights go on late, sunsets don't happen until as late as 9:30 on the longest days of the year.",reddit,downtown
"Yeah it's absolutely ridiculous that the bar has been set so low that simply the fact he admitted defeat, told his supporters it was fair and that he was conceding honorably and that they should as well, needs to be championed and highlighted on repeat like some courageous moment of courage and integrity is just wild to me. It's true though that it does need to be put on blast and applauded if only for the sake of reminding some how real life is. Unfortunately for him it'll probably end his ""immediate"" political future within the party. If your not willing to go full Lake ( as in Carrie Lake) style and lie, mislead, obfuscate, project, attack, and play the victim card as though it's the wild draw four (+4) card from uno, basically usurping everything, you ain't got no place within the ranks.

I don't know much about him beyond what I've read and listened to him speak on. His policy positions alone made it very clear our political ideologies are vastly different. Hearing him talk about old testament style wrath of God shit made it very clear we have vastly different spiritual beliefs as well. I can still recognize him as a fellow  American... my countrymen. I can still respect him for displaying this minimal standard of integrity... and even the little bit of courage it took for him to concede with a bit of honor. I give props and respect when deserved. 

You can be the most outspoken and flamboyant maga cult member, with excessive memorabilia and every tag line a part of your new language... hell, even with the decked out cyber truck flying his flags and decal that looks like Biden bound and gagged in your trunk... and still you wouldn't be treated as my enemy. I'd literally do everything in my power to avoid you and the sphere of arrogance that cat help but permeate around folks like that but at end of the day,  were both still Americans and love our country.  It isn't until one comes at me as though I'm the enemy or takes action against those I love and cherish or is in action against the Oath I swore to, that you lose the privilege and standing as a countrymen/ woman to me.  Open support of Nazism and facism is the kind of thing I'd perceive as threatening and no doubt I'd be seen as antifa and woke liberal radical. Lol so be it. Your not my enemy until you come at me as though I am yours... Just know, you'll be treated accordingly.",reddit,general madison

"Go from Oshkosh up to Green Bay and See Lambeau Field, then head up to Door County. Go to Cave Point County Park and Whitefish Dunes State Park. Then drive a bit further north to check out Cana Island lighthouse and the Ridges Sanctuary. Get a fish boil for dinner (reservations required). Find a place to spend the night in door county somewhere (before you go there...it's busy).

Now drive down the coast towards Milwaukee. Check out Lion's Den Gorge before hitting the city for a night or two. Perhaps hit up the r/milwaukee sub for some city ideas. On your way back to Chicago, be sure to stop at the Mars Cheese Castle. 

Got plenty of water/coastline views at home? Instead of the above, head to the Wisconsin Dells from Oshkosh. Enjoy the craziness of the ""waterpark capital of the world."" Yes, it's a tourist trap.

Go to any of the lakeside parks, or for a walk out to Picnic Point or around Governor's Island.

"I love this. Honestly, my imagination is getting stuck on what wood the bar might be made of/have as an accent feature/wall paneling. Like I feel like a safe bet is pine, but also it wouldn't be, could even be rich mahogany, maybe someone's grandpa cut down the tree, and it's not like I can ID wood based on looking at it.

But yup, we totally had that interaction. It happened. Like we are friends now. 

I really miss that aspect of bars. Sober for a few years now, since the people buying shots aspect of friendship got hard ya know, but also there's no reason I can't go to bars even sober. Bloody Mary's I could get pretty extra about even without alcohol haha, or ask for a virgin wisconsin old fashioned haha since that would actually just be a great drink. 

But for real I love the fact that you can just go to a place and hear that happy chatter, maybe one dude is way too into the game that hasn't even started, and like you just know you'll find a friend. Maybe don't know the friend yet, but it just happens. 

I missed that automatic community aspect more than I thought I did, like honestly one day if you ever see a blonde lady trying to finagle a soda being put into shotskis that might be me. 

Plus we also get friendship better than most. Like what you described is it. It starts fast and lasts forever, just not all at once.  Sometimes life gets busy, but also it's not like the friendship stops cause you're not actively talking 24/7. 

Kinda seems like some states don't get that and try and judge MN and WI friendliness haha if anything we have like all the friends just not always all of em all at once. Never know when you're gonna get stuck in snow or wanna go fishing or something. Friends are great. 

Haha I feel like I'm doing that thing where the game is over and I'm leaving, totally leaving, gotta go, but also it's going to be an hour before I actually leave because goodbye never seems like enough. 

Well yay for friendship. You made my night and day. I also wish reddit was more like this, but also it was like this, this time. So that's really nice and just awesome.

And even worse, people are paying higher prices-per-cup for the K-Cup/Nespresso products on store shelves.

Things to be aware of:

Trees in Madison suburbs are close to the street and will absolutely tear the bumper off of an RV when making a K-turn

Toll plazas in IN are narrow and if the automatic electric steps on the RV are not retracted because some moron flipped the “keep steps deployed” switch on, the steps will rip off the vehicle.

Route 80 in IN is bumpy and if a couple is “napping” in the RV bedroom, the bed can collapse (they swear that the f\*cking did not contribute)

IN is prone to tornadoes (discovered while riding a motorcycle… quite harrowing!)

"Q: What's The 3rd best brewery in Green County, the 2nd oldest in the country, and is the maker of the 1st beer I have actually spit out? A: minhas!

The Joseph Huber Brewery in Monroe was sold to minhas brewing in 2006. Before this, the brewery was a locally owned establishment, whereas if you treat an employee poorly on Wednesday you can bet that you will see them in the grocery store Saturday. The company would donate to local charities and projects, hold concerts and events, and was a source of pride in the community. The Huber family lived in town and were charitable, humble, and good for the Monroe community. I was much too young to drink, but I still hear the older guys at the bar reminisce about how they miss drinking the old local brew. 

This has all changed. For those of you unaware the minhas family earned their massive net worth in the Canadian oil industry and for some reason decided that a brewery would be a good investment. Good for them, I’m all for building and growing. But the way they have turned this brewery from a large local business helping the community to a piggy bank dedicated to exporting profits internationally is just sad. 

Here are some anecdotal examples that make me notice the difference. 

* Monroe is a very charitable community, Many local businesses both large and small donate and sponsor local events. Cheese days, the county fair, concerts on the square, Christmas parades, expansions of buildings housing non-profits etc. My point being is that we all notice who donates Colony Brands, Monroe Truck, PDC, The Bank of New Glarus, Klondike Cheese, Badger State Ethanol, The Monroe Clinic (also sold to a larger company, but they at lease have the sense to donate to the community). We see who goes to 4-H auction and buys a kid’s steer to help fund their future, We see who’s names are on the banners of local events and t-shirts, We see the CEO handing over one of those giant checks to build a community space. NEVER have I seen minhas’ name in the community outside of a beer tent or advertising. 
*  Last summer, the male owner of minhas was seen aggressively approaching a woman who was at a minhas event and very angerly and theatrically kicking her out. From what I hear she was simply standing with her friends enjoying the concert (which was held on city property). From the second-hand knowledge I have heard this was because the woman’s husband was fired the previous week from the brewery. I am unsure of the reason for being fired, but the way the minhas owner approached this woman it must have been due to eating his first born child alive. This story led to others telling of their sudden release from minhas in the weeks prior. Including a woman who disclosed she was pregnant 2 weeks prior to her termination. I understand business is business and the person in charge needs to make tough decisions for the company, but there's no reason to publically humilate someone's family over a business decision. 
*  Their advertising on social media is overtly promoting irresponsible overconsumption of alcohol. I am no saint and I definitely enjoy a drink or three, likely more regularly than I should. I also think that beer and alcohol marketing is some of the best and most creative in history between the old tin signs, the trinkets from the 50’s, the neon, the TV commercials. Beer and alcohol marketing undeniably a part of our history and one I enjoy! 

I do, however, have a problem with a brewery posting on social media with things such as: “Bad Day? Beer. Good Day? Beer. Stressed? Beer. Happy? Beer. Inspired? Beer. Looks like we have the solution to everything at the brewery!” another example “Craft beer: It’s not alcoholism, It’ a hobby, come enjoy your favorite hobby with us in the 2nd oldest brewery in the U.S.” another is “Life is all about one sip at a time! Start your day off right with one of these beautiful, heavy duty ‘Lazy Mutt’ ceramic coffee mugs! Fill it up with whatever beverage gives you a mood boost” In the words of DJ Khaled, ANOTHER ONE “You can’t buy happiness, but you can buy beer, and that’s kind of the same thing” Just because im bored, here’s another “What’s better than a Sunday Funday?! Did y’all know you could get a beer, take a tour and then get hard liquors &amp; wines all made right in Monroe,WI on the same street! It’s even got a name… The ‘Tri-Fecta’…. **have you survived it?**” That’s right, they’re asking if you have SURVIVED their combined, back to back to back beer, hard liquor, and wine tastings. This post in particular also features 2 ladies standing with beer in hand next to a red mustang with out of state plates. (PRO TIP don’t drink and drive). Anyways, perhaps I’m being prudish here, but I believe that massive alcohol manufacturers have a moral responsibility to not promote their products in a way that encourages over consumption, drinking in the morning, and drinking as an emotional crutch. Tell me how good your beer is, tell me how cold it is, tell me what foods your beer is good with, theres other ways that don’t encourage irresponsible drinking, I can figure that part out myself. We all know someone with alcoholism and it’s a sad, painful thing to watch happen to someone you love. Go ahead and advertise your brand, but have some class when doing so, you’re a brewery, not a poster in a college dorm. 

*  They had a billboard right by the entrance to the New Glarus Brewery for years and years. This billboard is literally 100 feet form the public entrance to the public entrance. It finally has been taken down, but this is one of the most classless, tone -deaf decisions I have ever seen. Have some respect for your competition, don’t be salty because their beer is objectively better than yours. This sign is finally gone, but every time I drove past it coming into New Glarus I just shook my head. It’s a small thing that speaks volumes on the morals and arrogance of the people making this decision. 
*  Their beer sucks. 

Anyways, that’s my rant. I finally had some time to sit down and type this out but I’m truly sad that this historical facility that has been the heart of my community is now in the hands of international oil barons who seem to have no regard or respect for the community that supports their business. Also, their beer sucks.",reddit,capitol square

"I live in the rural county of goatfuckistan, or somewhere up north of Highway 8 a ways.   People have absolutely no clue what is about to happen up here.  

The initial wave impacts are going to suck. However, compared to the secondary impacts, the first wave will be a happy memory of the kinder days-gone-by.  

When the hospitals and the clinics are closed because they lost their means of being paid for the mandated care they provide, some folks will wake up.  When the last local grocery goes out of business due to the reduction in SNAP benefits leaves Walmart and Dollar General as the only places to buy groceries, some will wake up. 

And when the farmers are all in bankruptcy because of a catastrophic market price crash brought on by the loss of the immense farm subsidies via SNAP and USAID purchases, some will wake up.

"Why should we need an ID on election day? You had to provide documentation to register proving your citizenship. 

Legally, the polling place is staffed with eligible voters from the community, and the voters in that polling place are from the same community. Even prior to the ID requirements passed in 2012, you still had state your name and address out loud in front of people from your community who could challenge anyone who attempted to impersonate you. If anyone managed to get passed that point somehow, when the real person showed up to vote they'd immediately know that someone had committed voter fraud and signed the poll book in their stead. But, that virtually never happened and when it did was typically a mistake that ID doesn't help.

All that said, we currently have laws requiring photo ID, and those laws objectively do already disenfranchise legal voters as is. For example, try to empathize with the hardships/lifestyle of a homeless person, and look into the process they have to go through to vote.

I've worked elections for over 20 years, before the ID requirement was even law, and I honestly don't see a need to cement the current laws into the Constitution. There was no significant fraud happening to begin with, thus the ID requirement only serves to disenfranchise legal citizens exercising their right to vote.",reddit,general madison

For nature stuff, La Crosse is in the Coulee Region.  Think Mini Texas Hill Country, with less height to the hills.  Mississippi River, along with tons of other rivers and streams.  Great, long bike trail from La Crosse heading east, about 32 miles in length.  Small ski and board slope just south of LaC.  Fishing year-round, if you don't don't mind risking it out on the ice.  

And did I mention bald eagles?  Tons of them around the area, especially along the Mississippi, but we have them gliding over our place every once in a while.  Wild turkey, deer, and more.  Turkey and deer are a daily sight, depending on the commute.

If you'll miss Texas barbecue and other regional cuisine, then, uh, learn to cook those yourself haha - you won't really find them here.  Wisconsin has its own specialties, of which you're likely aware of the big ones.  But it goes beyond that, if you look.  Supperclubs are a thing to be experienced, though not all are created equal.  

12 current listings for half-acre properties at $450k or less, just within LaC County.  18 more in Monroe County, 21 in Trempealeau County.  TC, depending on where the property is, kinda splits the difference between the La Crosse and Eau Claire metros.  Half-acre in the country in Wisconsin is usually plenty.  A lot of times a country property will border woods or a farm field, so you won't have neighbors crowding you even with the smaller lot.  Besides, a larger lot often means a longer driveway, which means more snow to clear.  Ask me how I know haha.

Someone else mentioned well and septic for country properties.  Wisconsin mandates septic inspections every three years, which is a good thing.  The well water at our place is - bar none - the best water we've ever tasted, and I've been traveling the country for work for the past 30 years.  Most places are meh, Texas well water is, frankly, undrinkable.  Here?  You can often get a simple in-line iron filter and a softener and call it good.  Reverse osmosis setup if needed, after you test for nitrates from farm run-off.

Anecdotally, winters have been a lot more mild the past decade or so.  We will typically have one or two weeks of a blast of cold (call it 10 or below for the daily highs), and the rest of the season is cold but not horrible unless windy.  Think 20s to upper 30s; after a few years, you'll call that Sweatshirt Weather.  December and January can feel pretty bleak as those are the cloudy months, but it gets better starting in February.  That description likely holds true for most of the southern half of the state.  Subtract 10 degrees and add more snow for the northern half.  Summers can be pretty great, 70-80s, with the occasional blast into the 90s.  Humidity can be a thing, though it hasn't been bad the last couple years.",reddit,general madison
"I had a longer response for my previous reply, but cut it down because I wanted to be concise. Maybe that was a poor choice. It would have  answered some of your statements/ points. 

“I can tell you don't know much about guns, or gun laws in this country.”  

No, I grew up around guns, though Im sure you do know more about them.  I have made an effort to stay informed about gun laws in WI and the US for multiple reasons. My whole family hunts and almost all of them live in very rural places.  I grew up eating hunted meat.  There are few police around to respond to distant calls in rural places in WI. I knew where the guns were in the house as a teenager; I was home alone a lot and aware of/ discussed preparation for robberies and home assaults. 

I hear from people in the city I work with that guns always make a home more dangerous. I don’t agree with that. If you live in a city, likely you don’t need a gun.  Likely, you’d hurt yourself.  But in the country, gun ownership is justified.  I’ve gotten chewed out about this; I don’t really care. If you don’t live in the country, you haven’t had that experience.

“Did you know that every federally licensed firearms dealer is mandated by federal law to conduct a background check for every firearm transfer they facilitate, no matter where it happens?”

Yes.  I do know that. 

So, are these school gun sales by dealers or by private individuals?  I assumed that a small gun sale would not be run by federally licensed firearm dealers.  That’s why I expressed concern, and I suppose that could be wrong.  But we know that private gun sales don’t require a background check.  If you win a gun in a local raffle, do you have a background check? 

I think selling an automatic weapon at a school sale is a little strange when we’re hearing about school shootings so often on the news.  Automatic weapons are more lethal to more people. 

“When an assault weapon and/or a large-capacity magazine is used in a public mass shooting, nearly 14 times as many people are injured, and twice as many people are killed.

In 2023, 18% of mass shootings in which four or more people were killed involved an assault weapon. However, these mass shootings represented 28% of all firearm-related deaths and 40% of all firearm-related injuries during mass shootings in which four or more people were killed.”

That’s from Brady United. Org. 


The only thing an automatic weapon is needed for is for shooting many times without stopping to reload. (I even checked Wikipedia in the strange case I might be off. 
And that author wrote: 

“An automatic firearm or fully automatic firearm is a self-loading firearm that continuously chambers and fires rounds when the trigger mechanism is actuated.”

I argue that the only thing an automatic is intended for is shooting many bullets, and likely multiple people at once, without reloading. 

“Assault weapons and large-capacity magazines are weapons of war and exist only to inflict maximum destruction. They are not useful for lawful self-defense or hunting sports. “

https://www.bradyunited.org/resources/issues/what-are-assault-weapons-and-high-capacity-magazines

I have handled guns and lived with guns in the house.  I was prepared to get a concealed carry license when a deranged creep was stalking and threatening me, and I would and could easily have satisfied that.  But the creepy pervert finally got evicted from my apartment building when I gave the police a huge stack of formal complaints issued to management and told them I was ready to act, upon further assault or threat, if they did not act.  

I do think that automatic weapons add substantially to victim numbers and kill numbers in mass shootings. 

https://www.congress.gov/117/meeting/house/115244/documents/HHRG-117-JU08-20221215-SD007.pdf

https://www.everytown.org/solutions/assault-weapons/

Yes, concealed handguns are often used in mass shootings and crimes.  Applicants for concealed carry licenses (for handguns) should be screened carefully.  I think it’s rather easy for criminals to buy handguns—privately. 

But mass shooter(s) would need multiple guns or time to reload if they’re  going to shoot many bullets and several people.  I doubt a mass shooting by a deranged person is a surgical strike.

I find that you didn’t answer my question—what’s an automatic weapon needed for if not to shoot multiple people and many bullets quickly, without reloading? It’s surely not needed for deer hunting, duck hunting, small game. I’m ok with guns in the home, have lived around guns, have used guns.  I just don’t see the need for automatic weapons in most cases. 

And yes, I acknowledge that the other reason to have guns is because of a possible need for protection against those who are supposed to protect or govern us.  That’s a more difficult argument and sure doesn’t preclude automatic weapon possession by private citizens.",reddit,general madison
"House Hunt Hello! New here, so please bear with me. 

My family is currently renting in Milwaukee county. We have enjoyed it, but it’s not feasible for us to buy there in the near future.

"""Gang symbols"" has been widely abused by DHS in determining association.

It's included images of basketball players, [a soccer team's logo, and someone flashing ""gang signs"" on social media that are sign language for love or commonly used for rock n roll](https://www.latintimes.com/soccer-team-tribute-tattoo-triggered-deportation-venezuelan-athlete-accused-gang-ties-579834). That last one is, quite literally, an emoji on your phone. We've also thrown that ""gang sign"" at one point or another in our lives.

That's why due process exists. To let a court adjudicate matters and assess the real credibility of the evidence.

Here a just a few snippets from the [judge's memo filed earlier today](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.31.0.pdf) for context:

* ""Neither the United States nor El Salvador have told anyone why he was returned to the very country to which he cannot return, or why he is detained at CECOT.""
* ""Even more disturbing, the Defendants concede that it cannot even produce the documents which reflect any authority, lawful or otherwise, to transfer him to El Salvador. ""
* ""As to the third element, Defendants deprived Abrego Garcia of this right without any procedural protections due to him. Indeed, nothing in the record suggests that Abrego Garcia received any process at all.""
* ""Defendants effectuated his detention in one of the most notoriously inhumane and dangerous prisons in the world. Defendants even embrace that reality as part of its well-orchestrated mission to use CECOT as a form of punishment and deterrence.""
* ""But particular to Abrego Garcia, the risk of harm shocks the conscience. Defendants have forcibly put him in a facility that intentionally mixes rival gang members without any regard for protecting the detainees from “harm at the hands of the gangs.”
* ""Although the legal basis for the mass removal of hundreds of individuals to El Salvador remains disturbingly unclear, Abrego Garcia’s case is categorically different—there were no legal grounds whatsoever for his arrest, detention, or removal. Nor does any evidence suggest that Abrego Garcia is being held in CECOT at the behest of Salvadoran authorities to answer for crimes in that country. Rather, his detention appears wholly lawless.""

In the off-chance this sheet metal apprentice does have some current gang affiliation, maybe he should be considered a risk. But just as if you or I were accused of something, that should be adjudicated in a court through lawful due process. However, the claim he had gang affiliation originated from being picked up in a Home Depot parking lot for loitering, which is really just a place day laborers gather to get a gig for a day's work.

The fact that the DOJ has been unable to produce any credible evidence whatsoever should be of concern. And if nothing else, he should not have been sent to El Salvador, a country which a judge in 2019 issued a non-removal order for determining that Abrego Garcia would be at grave risk of harm if sent there. DHS, in sending him to El Salvador, 1) inflicted cruel and unusual punishment, 2) deprived him of due process, 3) violated a court 2019 court order for non-removal, and 4) violated a recent court order to turn the planes around (which, it seems, had not even taken off at the time the order was given).

Tax plan
Harris says she'd provide bigger tax benefits for families but would offset the costs by raising corporate taxes
Under Harris' tax plan, according to an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, 95% of Americans would see lower taxes, and higher earners would pay more taxes. The top 0.1% — whose annual average income exceeds $14 million — would pay about $167,000 more in taxes. 

provide a financial cushion for small businesses with a tenfold increase in the startup expense deduction — lifting it from $5,000 to $50,000. New businesses wouldn't need to claim the deduction in their first year, when many take losses and would not be able to use it. Instead, they'd be able to wait until they're profitable and use the deduction at that time.

 Businesses would also be able to take part of the deduction in one year and save the rest for future years.

Child tax credit
Harris also suggests a return to the pandemic-era expansion of the child tax credit, up to $3,600 for young children. She hasn't released income eligibility thresholds, but it's likely that it would phase out for those at higher income levels.

Housing shortage
Harris says she'd address the nation's housing shortage with several initiatives. She promises to build 3 million affordable new homes and rentals by the end of her first term, offering tax breaks to builders who construct homes for first-time home buyers. She's also proposing a $40 billion fund to help local governments find solutions to the low housing stock.
And she wants to provide Americans who have paid their rent on time for two years with up to $25,000 in down-payment assistance, with more support for first-generation homeowners. 

Inflation
Inflation has cooled nearly to pre-pandemic levels, but prices have risen nearly 21% since the beginning of the pandemic. A recent survey found two-thirds of middle-income families said they're falling behind their cost of living 
Harris is trying to address the effects of inflation on lower- and middle-class Americans, an approach used by the Biden administration. 

She blames price gouging by food suppliers and grocery chains for high prices at the store and pledges to take on corporations with the first federal law against price gouging. 

Economists have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a law because they say that the reasons for food inflation are complex. 


She also wants to lower prescription drug costs, which has been a focus for the Biden administration. Last month, the White House announced Medicare reached agreements with drug manufacturers for lower prices for 10 drugs that treat a range of ailments, from heart failure and blood clots to diabetes, resulting in savings for patients of 38% to 79%, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

 It was Harris who cast the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted Medicare the drug negotiating authority.",reddit,general madison

"Oh just like we could raise our tariffs but we didn't have to?  

Coffee comes all different countries, Kenya, Jamaica, Columbia, etc.  once the tariff goes up all coffee prices go up because we as Americans have little knowledge of the over 19,000 HTS codes used to classify imports coming into the US.  Much less the added differences of the applied tariff amount for certain countries. 
Like let's look at coffee.  To get a HTS number so you can calculate duty you need to know if it is roasted or raw.  Is it already husked.  Is it ground or whole bean.  What is the weight of each piece.  Is it caffeinated or decaf.  Then you go to the country of origin.  This provided the tariff rate.

 According to US Customs a shirt is not just a shirt.  Is it for men or women or children?  Does it have buttons?  If so, how many?  What fabric is is made from?  Is it a blend?  If so what is the majority fabric used?  What is the country of origin?  Each of these questions is needed to provide the correct classification and tariff amount.  Is an alarm clock a clock or an alarm?  Each are different HTS numbers and different tariff amounts.  

Is a bike a bike if it is imported disassembled and the chain is not shipped or is each part it own HTS # with variable tariff rates?   What is the country of origin for each and every part if it isn't just a bike?

Basically no way can the American public know all of this, so all companies will run on greed and charge us based on the highest tariff they will have to pay and we won't know the difference.

"I’ve brought my kids from infant up to teenager with no problems. There are three hikes that go to the falls. The main one goes from the lower campground and is partially paved and partially gravel and dirt. Overall it’s a very easy, mid-range hike, but people with mobility impairments may have some trouble. A stroller with larger wheels works fine on it. The falls themselves can be viewed from the bridge or you can get right down and partially under them if you want, just watch the littler kids around the edges. It’s slippery where the water goes over them, but there are a number of shallow pools on the edge to splash in that are very safe. 

The most direct hike has an extreme elevation loss on the way to the falls from the secondary parking lot, but it’s very short. That path is paved until it joins the first hike along the river. It’s very strenuous and rough on knees just because of the steepness. A stroller is an option, but caution should be exercised on the way down, and the hike back up while pushing a stroller is a little rough. But at least it’s short.

The third hike is a windy dirt trail from the woods on the north side. It’s the least used and has wild raspberries along the way in the later summer. It makes for a nice change of pace but I prefer the first hike personally.

There are also a pair of overlooks. The easier one to get to is along the east side of the park and is a short hike from the parking lot. It’s a nice overlook, but not a great view of the falls. The other starts at the end of the falls hikes and goes straight up a staircase to the top of the bluffs. It’s worth doing if you have the energy for it, and there are railings along the entire thing for safety.",reddit,east side

Lake Geneva. Only 45 min from Milwaukee's airport.

Anywhere in the Driftless Area on the Mississippi. I've done some winter hiking in SE Wisconsin in the Driftless Area and they were great trips - we found an Airbnb with a fireplace and a hot tub that had an amazing view of the sunset over the Mississippi. However, more than 3-4 days would be pushing it and a lot of the places that pop to mind are quite far from major airports.

"In Wisconsin, would you guys find these behaviors rude? 1. Someone tries to stop you and says ""hi, excuse me, can you-"" and the other person goes ""I don't have any money on me."" And keeps walking.

2. You complain to a friend about how your cat keeps meowing at night and your friend bluntly goes ""your cat's fat."" Or other very bluntly honest things without trying to make it sound nice.

3. People don't use their turn signals, honk if you're driving too slow, use the shoulder to cut past traffic and go an average of 20-40 over

4. Someone doesn't want you 

5. You're at a counter service place and the cashier without a smile, and with his head resting on his hane goes ""um...can I help you?"" in an annoyed way

6. You're trying to take a picture in front of a tourist thing and people keep walking between you going ""excuse me!"" And then someone goes ""jesus fucking christ"" and pushes through

7. At a coffee shop, the cashier sees a customer acting dumb and instead of saying ""can you please behave better"" they scream ""GET OUT!"" Repeatedly in front of the other customers. 

8. People talking on their phone on crowded buses and trains, and not giving up their seats for elderly or pregnant people. 

9. You are taking up the entire sidewalk or escalator instead of staying to the right so instead of saying ""please move."" Someone shoulder checks you on the left and passes you without saying anything.

Now we’re trying IR Adderall booster for afternoon along with the Vyvanse 60mg. If that doesn’t work, I’m going to need to try something other than Vyvanse because it isn’t cutting it. She said she thinks it’ll get approved since I already tried the Focalin IR along with a lot of Vyvanse dosages. If not, I’ll have to try one more IR booster first instead. She deals with this insurance a lot though and led me to believe it’ll get approved and I’d have it by Wednesday. 

Anyone been in this situation? I’m just wondering how long it’ll take them to either approve or deny. It’ll be a full week Monday. I’ll be calling the pharmacy and insurance on Monday. The insurance sent something to my doctor to fill out on Tuesday and she sent it back same day. 

Thank you!",reddit,general madison
"Help w/ Badgercare prior authorization Adderall dose increase TLDR- I’m on 60mg Vyvanse (never needed a PA. I just had a PA done for 10mg Adderall as a booster dose, and it got approved. My psych upped me to 20mg Adderall, and now pharmacy says my insurance requires another PA. Why!? (Badgercare insurance)



Hi! 

This is a question for anyone w/ Badgercare (forward health) that has knowledge about prior authorizations.

I’m currently on 60mg Vyvanse (which never required a PA at any dose), and 20mg Adderall. I just had the PA done for my Adderall a few weeks ago (for 10mg dosage). I saw my doctor again last week, and she increased me to the 20mg Adderall. I had just picked up my 10mg refill though, so she told me to take 2 of the 10mg pills daily. Then let her know when close to from running out, and she’d send in the 20mg prescription. 

She told me we’d need a PA for this insurance for the Adderall when I stated the 10mg, but never brought up another PA just for a dose increase. It doesn’t make sense. I literally just got approved for the 10mg Adderall a few weeks ago. Why would I need another one for a small increase? I never needed one for any dosage of Vyvanse, or the Focalin I tried either. 

I know all insurance companies are different. That’s why I’m positing in this specific group. I’m hoping someone on state insurance could help me here. Is it normal to need another PA for Adderall? Just for a dosage increase?!",reddit,general madison

"Paying out of pocket for prescription (ADHD meds) on Badgercare Plus?  Hi guys, 
Recently moved back up here from out of state and lost my BXBS coverage from my last job so I’m on BadgercarePlus in the meantime. 
Last doctor/ pharmacy was with my hometown doctor / Walmart. Moved to MKE so had to switch to a closer doctor because docs outside of a certain radius get you flagged, and Walmart pharmacy was just a torrential clusterfuck every single month with my meds, so I switched both this past month. New doctor and new pharmacy looked much more professional and promising, but now I’m running into a new problem. 

I take two daily medications (Vyvanse and Adderall) for ADHD. State insurance is only paying for Vyvanse for now— doctor had to submit preauthorization form, took three days to deny, saying they wouldn’t cover multiple medications for same condition/wanted me to try other options, all of which I’ve already tried, so doctor submitted additional paperwork to appeal for special case, which can take 21 days to hear back, okay I’ve rambled enough— so I asked her if in the meantime I could pay out of pocket for the Adderall while we wait to hear back (generic is like $30, very reasonable). 
New pharmacy says that’s a no-go— state insurance won’t let you pay out of pocket for meds. Except I did exactly that through Walmart on multiple occasions when they were giving me the run around, telling me different information from my doctor, etc. It’s obviously very uncomfortable for me to be without meds and I have a lot going on (college student, self-employed) and I just wanted to get it over with and pay the out-of-pocket cost to get them. I never ran into a single issue doing this. 

Does anyone have experience with this? I feel like either Walmart dropped the ball on this rule (highly likely) or current pharmacy is being too cautious (not out of the question) but from their tone it seems like a big NO-NO. But shouldn’t my prior cash payments have gotten me in trouble with the state already?  I don’t know what to do! It’s been over a week I’ve been out of meds and I’m so tired and drained from this seemingly constant battle to get the meds that help me feel like a human being. 🥲",reddit,general madison

"Was Kohl’s Warned About Ex-CEO’s Shady Business Practices Before He Was Fired? This Exec Claims They Were In a stunning development this week, [Kohl’s announced the abrupt termination of CEO Ashley Buchanan](https://retailwire.com/kohls-ceo-fired-100-days-vendors-unethical/) just 100 days into his tenure. The reason? What the company described as “undisclosed conflicts of interest” surrounding vendor transactions, uncovered through an investigation by outside counsel.

  
But if Brittain Ladd, a business strategist and AI supply chain management and logistics consultant, is to be believed, this scandal was not just foreseeable — it was avoidable. And Kohl’s had been explicitly warned.

# Buchanan’s Abrupt Exit Raises Bigger Questions

According to Kohl’s [official statement](https://investors.kohls.com/news/news-details/2025/Kohls-Announces-CEO-Transition-Process/default.aspx), Buchanan was fired for breaching company policy by directing vendor contracts that posed “undisclosed conflicts of interest.” [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/kohls-ceo-ashley-buchanan-fired-investigation-03936a9a?mod=hp_lead_pos2) later reported that Buchanan had helped secure a multimillion-dollar consulting deal with Incredibrew, a vitamin-infused coffee company founded by his former romantic partner and ex-Walmart colleague, Chandra Holt.

Holt told the Journal, “I’ve known Ashley Buchanan for 10 years, but I have not received any compensation for my Incredibrew business from Kohl’s.”

Still, the damage was done. Buchanan, [who took over from Tom Kingsbury in January 2025](https://retailwire.com/kohls-names-new-ceo/), will not serve on the board or stand for re-election at the 2025 shareholder meeting.

# Brittain Ladd Says He Raised Red Flags Before Buchanan Was Hired

For Brittain Ladd, the firing wasn’t a surprise — it fulfilled a warning he claims he issued months ago.

The owner is a real gem. I had an unexpected hour-long conversation with him today which compelled me to get his word out there. Ken is the owner and in his words, he wanted “to prove that a business can be environmentally conscious, socially responsible, act for the betterment of the community and be successful.”  

Unfortunately, the business is having trouble drawing in guests while competing with brand recognition and the (perceived) convenience of corporate options. I want to put the word out there because I feel it's important to recognize and support these local shops that are trying to do good in the community.

If you're in the area, please give the place a quick look. It would be a shame if establishments like this disappeared and we were left with heartless, unscrupulous corporate options that rob our community of character and compassion.

"Experiences with Staying Focused During Busy Farm Seasons?   
Hey fellow Wisconsinites,

  
I’m reaching out to our amazing community to hear how you all manage during those intense work periods, especially for our farmers and anyone in agriculture. 

  
Living in a rural area near La Crosse, I've always loved seeing the rhythm of farming life - early mornings and backbreaking dedication. I help out at my family's dairy farm, and come hay baling season or calving time, it feels like coffee alone just doesn’t cut it anymore!

  
Last summer, an old buddy of mine from UW-Madison mentioned he found natural ways to boost energy and focus without feeling burnt out by noon. He’s always been super productive but never seemed jittery or wired.

  
I’m curious: What do you use as your go-to methods or supplements to stay sharp? Have any particular techniques worked wonders for you in managing both physical workload and mental alertness during peak seasons?

  
Also, what are the potential upides/downsides you've noticed from these habits? Always aiming for that balance between getting jobs done efficiently without running ourselves into the ground!

  
Lastly, has anyone else taken up new practices—or even specific foods—during our longer Wisconsn winters that helped when transitioning back into high activity seasons?

One PA can be done over the phone and the other  has to be done by paper in that case.

 Vyvanse has to be tried before Adderall is authorized. 
It shouldn't be a big deal for the pharmacy to end the PA for 10mg. They just have to pick the previous days date and get the PA with the current days date, if the provider has completed the forms. 

The state is extremely picky. One little mistake can stall the whole process. We have been trying to get a mounjaro PA for a diabetic patient for over a month.

Looking for recommendations on a trip from the west side of WI into SD, perhaps the Badlands or Custer Area.  22’ travel trailer.  2 elementary age kids. 

My initial plans - either early or late July, I’ve got a 10 day window to play with. Find a State park in MN near the SD boarder, spend a day or 2.  Then on to SD, Black hills. Somewhere in or around Custer/Keystone.  

Goals - Zero agenda, see nature and explore.  I’ve never been west to SD.  (However recommendations on activities are appreciated)

Needs - Electricity, swimming.

We could see lightning flashes to the north and east. A cloud formation of what looked like falling clouds to the west. A line of low fast dark clouds went over right before the rain hit.

"I have OP more information than I use.  Driving to Washington?  I'm going to get on I-94 or I-90 and roll west.  The question is do you want to drive across North or South Dakota?  So not much planning there.

For most places I road trip, it's about the same level of planning.  There is usually only one clear fastest way to get there unless you need a side trip to Cincinnati so the wife can see the hippo's at the zoo.

But for a newbie with anxiety, good planning reduces anxiety.  I'm not sure exactly where in Ohio OP was looking to go so I didn't go into specifics like I-65 in Indiana sucks.  But I like to stop at the exit with the Oakes farm to take a break and buy chocolate milk and cheese.  Or the the toll road across the North of Indiana is boring, easy, but boring.  Avoid US 30 as it's much slower.

OP also didn't need to here about that time I took my '84 Honda motorcycle with 1/4"" of seat foam from Milwaukee to Salt Lake City to Spokane and back.  I felt every freaking mile of that in my butt.  Driving across Nebraska is boring.  Doing it on an '84 Honda with no seat foam in 95 degree heat with no clouds?

"It very much depends on if extreme political leanings in the community you move to are potentially an issue. Once you get out of Dane County in the west, or Milwaukee County in the east, the two counties between are bright red extreme MAGA republican. That being said, some highlights that I know of:

Madison itself - Moving to Madison or one of it's immediate eastern suburbs (Sun Prairie, DeForest, Monona, McFarland) leaves you at about a 80-90 minute drive to get to Milwaukee, politics are super liberal, and housing prices are very over-inflated. I am an east-sider myself, and we will usually drive to MKE about once a month for some reason or other (museum visits, relatives, etc).

Cottage Grove/Deerfield - these two villages are on the east end of Dane County right along I94. Close enough to Madison to be more purpley, and some pretty towns with good schools and fun summer festivals.

Cambridge - boasts the beautiful Lake Ripley, best place for lake swimming in Southern WI in my opinion.

Lake Mills/Johnson Creek/Jefferson - Nice towns as long as you don't mind the politics (very small town republican), they sort of circle the mid-point between Madison and Milwaukee.

There are a bunch more small towns between Johnson Creek and Waukesha that I am not familiar with and can't help you with, Rome, Sullivan, Oconomowoc, Nashotah, and Delafield are all pretty unfamiliar to me, probably someone else in the sub can give you a good description of them.

Waukesha - I've never spent much time here, but every time I hear about Waukesha, drive through it, or get anywhere close to it I get this horrible combination of NIMBY + MAGA that makes me want to stay 100 miles away. So I leave.

Brookfield/New Berlin/Muskego/Menominee Falls - The big far-western suburbs of Milwaukee. Bit of a drive to Madison from any of these, and they have a pretty strong white flight suburbia energy, but lack the absolute crazy town vibes of Waukesha.

Milwaukee and near west suburbs (west allis, wauwatosa) - I've never lived there, and can't speak to real estate prices, but all indications are that Milwaukee is a pretty hopping fun town. Just like east side of Madison, it's a full 80-90 minute drive to make your way to Madison.

Hope this helps!",reddit,east side

Oulu, Wisconsin Translation:

    Little ponds and forest land
    Grainfields and cow pastures
    Through Wisconsin it takes you 
    US highway 2
    
    It rained and rained and rained, so
    When I arrived in the town of Oulu
    Big white rock at the crossroads
    Was the sign of where to turn 
    
    Oulu, a quiet path of a village I see
    Oulu, I step into a small glass shop
    And stay for a cup of afternoon coffee
    
    Birches, ashes, and other trees
    Familiar from our yards at home
    Many houses with Finnish flags on poles
    
    Hay barns on the sides of fields
    Crows sitting on a fence
    “This homeland of the north  [Kotimaa tää pohjoinen]*
    The dear country of our fathers”  [maa kallis isien]*  
    (*Lines from the Finnish national anthem)
    
    Oulu, I’m thinking this place could be in Finland
    Sitting, and waiting for the wind to blow these rain clouds away
    
    Oulu, these stoic quiet people
    Oulu, the girl in the glass shop tells me
    “by the way, it’s pronounced Oolu around here.”

"Welcome! Biggest difficulty will be hotels in GB but pre-season games should be a bit easier to secure.  You may consider flying into Chicago (4hours), Milwaukee (2hours) or Madison (2hours) to maximize your opportunity to see the larger cities and drive into GB, even if it’s just for a night. Short list for GB include food stops ($$$) Chefusion (upstairs lounge or formal dining downstairs), Iron Duck, Redwood Inn for classic fish fry, Mangiares. Haggemeister has a fantastic patio on the river deck, food is decent, great day or night (outdoor fires). Titletown across the street from lambeau has tons of activities and events daily so watch their schedule. Lenny tap for a classic Wisconsin tavern, hotel Northland (Poke the Bear or Walnut room) for a drink and to check out the beautifully restored hotel. Meyer Theater has some great affordable shows and concerts. Bay Motel &amp; Family Restaurant is the place to go for breakfast before a game. There’s a counter to eat at and visit or grab your own table. Splurge for the Lambeau tour and do the longer one, book online in advance.

Stop in Dykesville, another 10 minutes further for the best fried cheese curds in the state at the bowling alley.

"As others have said, you'll want to move somewhere on the South or West side of Madison/Dane County, which unfortunately is one of the more expensive areas whether renting or buying.

Verona and West Madison are livable, but you'll almost certainly be renting unless you both have a lot of savings and the rent isn't cheap out there, Fitchburg or Oregon are right next door and have tons of new development where you will probably find a cheaper deal or some older house or apartment that is much cheaper because of said new development.

The West Side and its connection to the Isthmus/downtown (it's a city built between four lakes, the geography is really limiting) will give you plenty of access to bars, entertainment venues, concerts, and late night food as well as not too much of a distance from more outside activities like hiking or biking and of course there's always the lake.",reddit,downtown

"How many gas pumps do you think are in Madison right now? I sincerely doubt it's dramatically more than 450, it might even be less.
And yes, you can use them more quickly than most chargers, but I also never claimed there was enough chargers right now for every apartment household to get one immediately.

I know numerous non-student adults in downtown who get by fine without one)


And speaking of bad math: claiming hundreds of thousands of EVs will appear in Madison if we pull out all the stops to try to transition to EVs is just plain silly. There's probably not even 200,000 total cars in the city.
There's only 280,000 people in the city and most of them are either children, people living in houses where they can charge, or college students or others who don't have cars to begin with.
And that's ignoring the fact that while reducing burdensome charges as I've advocated would certainly likely increase EV adoption, I never said it would lead to everyone instantly buying an EV. And to believe it would is nonsensical.


Lastly: to emphasize again, i never claimed there was enough chargers for every car in Wisconsin to be an EV right now, but there's certainly capacity for dramatically more EVs than we currently have. And that capacity is going to keep increasing rapidly with each passing year. The article was only about NEVI funded chargers, plenty of places in Madison and elsewhere are installing chargers without that funding.


To the degree chargers are a barrier, as i said that'd be a great use for the huge surplus the state is sitting on: building more chargers.",reddit,downtown

When you vote, make sure to mention who you voted for in the Exit Poles. We need overwhelming support for Susan Crawford to make sure they can't spin the narrative. We also have to have handcount audits of the largest counties to make sure that everything was fair and square.

"Lessee, further off the beaten path....  well, if you like fishing, a charter expedition for lake trout on Big Green Lake is always a blast.  Recommend a friend, Mike Norton.  He's forgotten more about Big Green than most ever knew.  

Lots of options around cheese, depending on where you're stopping, there's likely a place that offers tours, tasting and sales.  

Heck, lots of options around wine, beer, and spirits as well.  Door county is known for it's fruit wines and cherries.  If you're in New Glarus, New Glarus Brewing Co has tours Tues-Saturday.  Some interesting brews available seasonally, I've been intending on stopping in and picking up some of their new Scream Double IPA. 

Local shows/galleries...  Well, if you're in the Fox Cities(Appleton area) there's the Houdini Museum in downtown Appleton.  Love the place, I've spent a bit of time there as I graduated from Lawrence University, whose campus partially surrounds the Museum.  I believe it's been renamed from just the Houdini Museum to The History Museum at the Castle.

If you're in Appleton already, for Houdini, then there's also the Trout Museum a few blocks west, also on college avenue, relocating across the street of the Castle once their new location is finished. (315 College, mixed use building, partnership between Trout and LU.  1st floor is the new Trout, 2nd floor is University space, 3&amp;4 are apartments.). 

Also in Appleton, there's Hearthstone Historic House, the Birthplace of Green Energy.  It's the first private residence in the world to have hydroelectricity.  

If you like glass, you'd definitely want to stop in Neenah at the Bergstrom Mahler Museum of Glass.  I'm looking forward to checking out one of the upcoming exhibits, Primer.

"not so much one resort as a whole region of them but Door County is really a great spot with plenty to offer for all ages and interests, Im biased towards Sturgeon Bay as the best city to stay in, but you really can’t go wrong with wherever you feel suits you best. Assuming you’re in SB, everything within Door and Kewaunee counties is &lt;60 minutes away, and Green Bay is 45 minutes away in case you need bigger city amenities for whatever reason. Not sure when your trip is, but expect major crowds anytime in the summer, but not as much in the unpleasant disneyland/theme park way, more just a lot of people out and about and longer waits for restaurants and the like, the ‘Lakeside’ towns are going to be quieter and more nature and relaxation focused (Baileys Harbor, Jacksonport, etc) whereas the ‘Bayside’ towns are much more touristy with plenty of shopping and dining options. Sturgeon Bay is a mix of both IMO, as it has a pretty bustling downtown for a city of ~10k, but it also has some more residential neighborhoods especially as you get to the east side of town. If you have young kids as well, it is nice as it has all the staple fast food places for picky eaters, as well as a target and walmart if you need to make a shopping trip.

The dam in Berlin is a slog right now, water's high and the parking lot is flooded.  

The locks by Eureka as well as the public fishing area just to the west of the Eureka locks are good spots.  There's a fishing platform on the north side of the dredge island that's pretty popular, mostly panfish and drum caught from there.

There's some great fishing on and around Big Green Lake, though the best fishing on big green is only accessible from a boat.  There's a new fishing dock on the south end of the sunset point park and boat landing.  Some decent shore fishing just east of Green Lake at the Spaulding bridge landing, though I usually use this as a canoe launch.  Decent amount of accessible shoreline on the south end of the lake as well, Dodge Memorial County park and the boat landing to the West.    

Another spot I've had some good luck at is Playground park in Green Lake.  Fishing the dartford mill pond for bluegills, though the weed cover might be such that dropping bait in with a cane pole is easier than casting.

It's a little bit of a drive north, but I'd also suggest checking out Nelson Park on the Crystal River, in Little Hope, just south of Waupaca.  Nice place for some shore fishing with a chance to catch some rainbow trout.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I used to live there. I still do but I used to also.

It has most of the basic amenities you need for everyday living: Walmart, Aldi, several other grocery stores (including a hispanic store with a restaurant attached). I would love to see a Target, but they don't seem to put stores in cities under 40K people.  Many big food chains are here if you're in to that sort of thing and there's several other decent local restaurants. The local stage theater is nice and there's a smaller movie theater that keeps up with most of the new releases. If you like drinking and entertainment, there's several bars on the lake, one has live bands every weekend through the summer, and there's another small venue downtown that gets shows promoted by WJJO or other local radio stations. The last show I went to was Powerman 5000/Adema and several other bands. $25 and I got to walk there, so not too bad IMO.

There's a good amount and variety of parks, disc golfing, and fishing spots depending on what you do for fun.

My wife and I plus our 3 kids went through the Beaver Dam Schools from K-12 and I don't have any particular complaints (although I don't have any first hand knowledge to compare to Madison, other than the stories I see here).

Politics wise, I think we're getting an influx of people from Madison and Milwaukee as the overall vibe seems more left leaning, but you do have a fair amount of obnoxious houses here and there with their Fuck Biden flags and what not. Like many others here, I tend not to broadcast my political views on my front lawn.

The current administration seems pretty intent on improving the city to attract more people to move and businesses to come here and I think they are succeeding, despite all the naysayers

**There is some petty crime here, but I don't think it's any worse than a similar city of this size. You're more likely to have your catalytic converter cut off than your Kia stolen :)**  

The one major thing I wish I'd see here that Madison has is better infrastructure for walking/biking. The city is trying with a few specific streets with bike lanes and others marked for mixed use (although no one here seems to understand how that's supposed to work). We're going to get a bike path eventually connecting Beaver Dam to Horicon which crosses the Wild Goose Trail on 26.

I've probably broken even between what I spent on my house here and the gas money I've spent driving back and forth to Madison for work vs. just buying a house in Madison. It's about 90 minutes there and back from the east side and 20000 miles a year. However, since I've been working from home, that's not a negative anymore. Now I just drive to Madison for the occasional concert or show and sometimes for a Woodman's stop.

There are other similar cities where it's worse for amenities. I lived in Waupun for 6 months and couldn't handle having to drive to Beaver Dam every time I needed something from Walmart (or anywhere on Sundays because the whole city would shut down). You could do worse than Beaver Dam. You could probably also do better, but you'll pay for it with higher house prices and taxes (probably)",reddit,downtown

"&gt; Voters in and around Madison will pick the winners of four seats in the
&gt; Legislature on Aug. 13 because only Democrats are running for these positions.
&gt; Our Wisconsin State Journal editorial board met with all 10 candidates. We thank
&gt; them for their time and giving voters a choice. Below are the four leaders we
&gt; recommend.
&gt; 
&gt; SENATE DISTRICT 16
&gt; 
&gt; This is the most watched race in south-central Wisconsin because it pits three
&gt; members of the Assembly, all of whom are giving up their elected positions to
&gt; try to join the Senate. The district, which was redrawn because of a legal
&gt; challenge to Republican gerrymandering, stretches from Madison’s Far East Side
&gt; and Fitchburg to Sun Prairie, Cottage Grove, Stoughton, Marshall, Lake Mills,
&gt; Fort Atkinson and Waterloo. All three candidates would do a fine job. We’re
&gt; endorsing Samba Baldeh because of his infectious optimism, broader perspective
&gt; and determination to get things done. Baldeh’s inspiring biography includes
&gt; emigrating to America in 2000 from Gambia, where he tended livestock for his
&gt; nomadic parents and says he walked six miles to school to learn English and get
&gt; a Western education. After earning a computer degree, he worked as a software
&gt; engineer for American Family Insurance before winning election to the Madison
&gt; City Council and then the Legislature. When his neighborhood on Madison’s North
&gt; Side lacked a grocery store, he opened a small one, catering to local residents
&gt; with international and American food. Concerned about a lack of affordable
&gt; housing for families, he renovated and rented apartments above the grocery,
&gt; which was a former strip club that his neighborhood was happy to see go.
&gt; Baldeh’s peers elected him president of the City Council and a leader of the
&gt; Black Caucus in the Legislature. Though his focus while representing Madison has
&gt; been on urban challenges, he says his upbringing in a village of 40 people will
&gt; help him relate to and appreciate rural challenges. He remembers advocating for
&gt; fresh water as a young man in West Africa. Today, he says, rural parts of
&gt; District 16 badly need broadband to connect to and compete in the global
&gt; economy. Baldeh will be a champion for small business and job training. He will
&gt; be a powerful voice for the opportunity public education provides. He wants to
&gt; improve accessibility to child care. He promises to pull people together and
&gt; promote “freedom and fairness.” Rep. Jimmy Anderson of Fitchburg earned strong
&gt; consideration from our editorial board, too. We endorsed him in the past for the
&gt; Assembly as an important advocate for the disabled, among other priorities. A
&gt; drunken driver killed his parents and brother and left him paralyzed. Anderson
&gt; successfully won reasonable accommodations to do his job from a stubborn
&gt; Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, at the statehouse, raising his profile
&gt; and influence. Rep. Melissa Ratcliff of Cottage Grove makes a compelling case
&gt; that she can best represent all of District 16 — rural, suburban and urban.
&gt; Ratcliff was a key advocate for building a new and more humane Dane County Jail.
&gt; But Baldeh’s refreshing approach to public service and love for American
&gt; democracy deserve wide support from voters.

Madison is a 250k pop city (2nd biggest in WI) that is very nice but disproportionately expensive to live here for the size and a little bit on the quiet side sometimes. Capital city and Big10 college town.

Milwaukee is a big city (1st in WI), 1.25 hours East of Janesville. Relatively affordable as cities go, has a mixed reputation but I think it’s an underrated and has a ton of potential if they’d just get their urban planning together and delete the downtown freeways.

"I agree with this, being born and raised here.  It was once a completely conservative town, where there was nothing to do but church and drinking.  A lot of the older generation still enjoys one or both of those main hobbies.  Thankfully, we've become more diverse over the years, both politically and racially.  Our parks are pretty nice for a town this size.  The lake is not for swimming, but decent for boating, kayaking.  We have a lot of little festivals throughout the year.  The schools are pretty great overall.  I've been here over 40 years, and feel like it's pretty boring, but has definitely improved over the years.  Madison is nice and close, as are Fond du Lac, and Milwaukee around an hour or so away.  We have a few dining options, but if you don't mind the drive to Sun Prairie or the East Side of Madison, the possibilities are infinite.  In the last few years, we've gotten a couple of nice local little bars/restaurants, as well as a Baskin/Dunkin, Marshalls, Five Below, and Harbor Freight.  There's a simple little river walk downtown (a big chunk of our old downtown was flooded and torn down in 2008).

"I was friends with a mechanic that owned a gas station, kwik trip built across the street, two years later they went from buying gas every month to then having to put up front the money for a years worth of gas, from him and I admit this is an anecdote but he claimed kwik trip made a deal with the gas companies so that all other gas stations had to pay up for a year of gas which is in the millions, it killed off quite a few smaller gas stations here. KT has a monopoly in my town the entire east side is all kwik trips, theres only a few ciscos and bp and reiser stations left. Last week all the KT's were $.45 higher then all those other gas stations. I will admit I do like KT cause they certainly take care of their employees, I use them as an example often when people say no one wants to work, its all about money and respect, if a company is willing to pay a good wage and take care they've no issues with finding employees, KT is very rarely struggling to find work.",reddit,east side

"Haha yeah some interchanges suck. I’m guessing you’re talking about one of our two spaghetti junctions. 94 and 35E in St Paul and 94, 35W, US 12, US 52, and MN 55 in Minneapolis. They each suck. 


St. Paul tends to be a big more old and laid back (mainly buildings and neighborhoods, I don’t know census data). Minneapolis is more active and had more things happening. Minneapolis tends to have the best restaurants, theaters, sports, parks, and whatnot. Not by much, and St. Paul is no slouch at all. 

In reality, most people who live in Minneapolis stay on the east side of town, and vice versa, so each thinks their side is better. They both have their awesome and charming parts, and their crummy parts. 

If you’re looking to move up here, I’d recommend spending some time (a week or more if possible) and spending time exploring each city and some of their suburbs. Like everywhere, weekends aren’t a great barometer of a city. Head to a local bar, cafe, coffee shop, art gallery, whatever, and ask the locals what they like, where they go, etc. 

As long as you can deal with winter, the Twin Cities are amazing, and you appreciate all the rest of the seasons so much more!

"Moving to Madison---neighborhood advice? I'm coming to Madison for my PhD, which I'm really excited about considering I've heard great things about the city! Looking for some advice on housing options---I checked the FAQs and the sub's wiki but most of that info seemed dated and I wasn't sure if anything has changed in recent years.

I'm looking for an area that's a bit quieter/residential but still with access to a grocery store and other amenities. (By ""quieter"" I really just mean ""won't have constant sirens and crowds of loud drunk students 5 nights a week"") I won't have a car and will instead have an e-bike, but being in walking distance to amenities/being connected to the bus system would be great too. Bikeability and not being afraid of being hit by a car anytime I go in the street is more or less a must-have. I love running and outdoorsy things, so it would also be awesome to be close to any parks or green spaces that have substantial trails.

Considering all of that, based on what I've read + heard from current residents is that I should be looking for apartments in the Vilas, Monroe St., or Near East areas. That sound about right? I think my budget will be ≤~$1200, is that workable in these neighborhoods? (Ideally I'd like a 1BR apartment but I'm chill with roommates and sharing a house or townhome.)

Any neighborhoods to definitely avoid based on my preferences? Also, any concerns to be aware of? I'm from the Midwest and I'm coming from a college town so I think I'm pretty aware of the problems endemic to both those places (weather, depressing gray skies for 3-4 months, rowdy undergrads), but want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Ok, here is a tiny bit of intrigue:  The second floor of that building has been closed to the public for over 50 years.

Wouldn't the owner have made a fortune just renting it out all those years?  What are they hiding?  I think the upstairs until the late 1970's was occupied by Dr. Holiday (or Holliday) DDS.  It was a dental office until at least the weekend that Elvis died.  The dentist probably retired or maybe got sick of the lack of air conditioning but what is up there noiw?  Is it haunted?

"Upcoming opportunities to be pro-housing! Hi all,

I wanted to let people know about a few upcoming opportunities to be pro-housing. Tomorrow [the Plan Commission](https://www.cityofmadison.com/city-hall/committees/plan-commission/2024-04-08) is going to vote on a change to the zoning code that would allow ADUs on properties besides single-family homes, and also remove the owner-occupancy requirement (Legistar 81952). After Plan Commission, the change will go to Common Council on [Tuesday, April 16](https://www.cityofmadison.com/city-hall/committees/common-council/2024-04-16).

This is a pretty small change to the ADU ordinance, but it will make it easier for people to build them. The main concern with removing this ordinance is that it will increase corporate ownership of housing, however [a study from California](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ADU-Brief-2020.pdf) after they removed owner-occupancy restrictions for ADUs state-wide found that 92% of ADUs were constructed on by individuals rather than corporations. Removing owner-occupancy restrictions along with other restrictions on ADU construction did lead to an astounding 10-fold increase in ADU production, from 1,269 ADUs permitted in 2016, the year before the reform, to 14,702 ADUs permited in 2019, just two years after the reform took place.

Choking off roads and arterials pushes traffic into areas you don't want it. I also already take Monona Dr. instead of 51, and it almost always saves me quite a bit of time. Slowing it down more will only make that worse.

Slowing down East Washington has pushed more and more traffic into neighborhoods, onto Johnson/Gohram, or Willy St., as another example.

SBRT off SB First to WB East Washington:  
No Turn on Red is because of a NBLT drivers, a dual right turn lane, and expected increase in pedestrian activity in the future.

For example, the NBLT phase does not use a flashing yellow arrow to better separate the SBRT and NBLT movements. 

Right turn off EB East Wash to SB First:  
This was installed to better protect crosswalk users at the BRT station. It's a relatively light movement, but again, with potential increased pedestrian activity and due to the amount of traffic that might otherwise be blocking drivers views of the crosswalk, the sign was added. In addition, that crosswalk crossing East Washington is/can be on when either NB or SB First is going, so there's no time other than when EB East Washington is green that the ped crossing in question is/could be on.

Not to mention other traffic that you wouldn't want to hit. So when either phase coming off North or Milwaukee is green, the ped crossing the EB lanes of East Washington is or can be active as the crossings on both sides are split to be more efficient and remove vehicle/pedestrian conflicts.",reddit,east washington

"I'm not sure what mirror universe you are talking to me through but the people of Madison are like the least dour in almost any city I've been to in the US except maybe like San Diego. 

There's always a ton of people outside gardening on the east aide, a lot of homeowners on the east side are too granola for mowing the lawn so there are houses completely overgrown with a plethora of different species. They've got weird tiny theaters, strange antique shops, and hippie diners. 

These West side can be a bit corporate, especially as you approach Middleton and Verona and get closer to epic and the bigger industries, but there are a ton of incredibly young bright people biking or taking the bus to work at the university or healthcare. They've got name brand stores, two shopping malls, and large houses (for the area.)

Downtown on the square has the various professional employees that work at, there's always some group of protestors protesting something, the university is just a few block away so the hum of college kids being dumb horny and awkward, and the panhandlers in between trying to guilt you out of a few dollars. It's got fancy restaurants, less fancy restaurants, a weekly farmers market that shuts down the whole square, it's got music and dancing and so many fucking events. The damn children's museum occasionally hosts adult swim nights where a bunch of grown ass adults make paper airplanes and blow bubbles.

Of course it's less busy when it's fucking cold outside, but I feel like it's more ""cozy* than ""dour"" on the coldest nights of the year. In the winter people cut through the Capitol building to get to the other side of the square faster and warmer. But you'll still see all the dad-boded men in shorts and a tee shirt just vibing outside in 5° weather.

Please feel free to share; Its day 9, and today I want to express thanks and gratitude for all the kind thoughts, concerns and prayers regarding my missing son Danny. They are appreciated. I also appreciate reports of sightings. We never know when it might just be him. I keep hoping that he's safe out there, warm and has enough food to eat. I can't fully understand what is going on in his mind to frighten him to leave like this or to go into hiding. He doesn't seem to be anywhere that one would think he'd end up. Believe me we've looked. There have been possible sightings on a Bike traveling to places. Unfortunately we haven't gotten photos to verify if that is indeed him or not. We hold out hope that we find him and he's safe. We don't even know for sure if he has a jacket at this point. We are only certain he was was wearing a red Marty's Tshirt, black Columbia sweat Pants and camouflage sliders. As his mom I hope somehow he has acquired better shoes, a hat, jacket and of course food. On another note, the original report suggested two bikes were missing however, We have discovered that there wasn't a second bike missing. And he is alone. This evidence was found from a surveillance video neighboring his home as they identified a white male wearing a red tshirt walking a single bike at 10:43 pm east on Madison Street near St. Paul Ave. That information has been supplied to the police. Waukesha residents and business owners, If you own a property on Madison or St Paul and have surveillance if you could look for a sighting wed appreciate it. For all concerned citizens, If you do think you see him, please pull over and take a photo and share that with the police as soon as it happens. That photo could be the difference between us finding him or not. They are trying to find out if he is still on a Bike or not. We dont know if he's gotten warm clothing yet. He has a very noticeable Roman Numeral Tatoo on the side of his neck. So photos are vitally important. They are crucial and save us precious time. We'd also like to thank the local media for their help as well. Please continue to pray and we hope we receive a Thanksgiving Blessing with his safe return.",reddit,general madison

As it is now there's only two places that feel safe to cross, Randall and Mills. They have traffic lights/crosswalks and aren't as crazy as the intersections with Monroe and Park. Crossing in the crosswalks on Orchard, Charter or Brooks is like playing a live action game of Frogger.

That said, Monroe Street has been able to make things work. It's a busy street but also gets a lot of pedestrian traffic.

I’ll echo others here that despite the fact that it will be busy, it’d be worth it to book lodging downtown and take in the experience of the city at its best.  A gameday weekend in September is generally great weather and very enjoyable.

Hard to give specific advice not knowing your age range and interests, but almost everything within the downtown is walkable or e-bike-able which you’ll see everywhere.  Most decent hotels are on the capitol square, West Johnson Street, East Washington Ave, and John Nolan Drive near the capitol.  If you go farther west or east and are OK coughing up for Ubers, cost goes down a bit and you’re still within a 20 min drive.

**Travel**

- MKE and ORD are both fine to fly into.  I’m a big fan of the bus when I’m solo traveling, usually taking van galder or greyhound from Chicago to Madison.  It drops you in the heart of downtown, about a half mile to mile from most hotels.

**Dinner**

- if you’re solo that changes the game, then I’d be looking for something fun and social, maybe with a bar and some atmosphere.  Pizza-wise, Salvatore’s on East Washington is a nice vibe, fun atmosphere but not wild.  Pizza is great.  

- Just a few blocks closer to the capitol is Eno Vino; pricey but an absolutely stunning view, wrap around bar, good flatbreads and cocktails, and a killer balcony.  It’s at the top of the AC hotel which would also be a fun place to stay

- Grandpa’s pizza on Williamson Street and Greenbush Bar Restaurant on Regent St would be my other suggestions for pie, both are cozy spots.  Grandpa’s is on one of the most foodie and “Portland/seattle” vibes streets in Madison, walking up and down here you can’t go wrong for food or drinks.  Greenbush is in the heart of the football neighborhood, you’ll be back here on gameday as Regent is all restaurant parking lot tailgates for miles during the game.  It’s a sea of people on those days, and absolutely wonderful (unless that’s not your scene)

**Safety**

- Madison is arguably one of the safest cities in America, most crime is in incredibly isolated pockets well outside the downtown, personal affairs, or someone doing something completely ignorant and getting taken advantage of.  As long as you keep a head on your shoulders you should be able to move about with little issues.  Don’t spring for a hyper budget motel way down east wash, otherwise you’re good.

**Things to do**

- Do not miss doing some walking on the main downtown routes.  Walk Atwood Avenue, Williamson Street, State Street.  See the student memorial union and the Monona Terrace.  Walk the commuter path as others said from West Washington Ave to Camp Randall Stadium.  Walk over to Regent and enjoy some tailgating at Jordan’s Big Ten Pub, Lucky’s, Sconnie’s, or whatever looks good.  People are friendly, strike up some chat at the bar or in the tailgate crowd.

- If you get really sauced on a given day, Ian’s Pizza.  Nothing like a drunk slice of Mac N Cheese or Smokey the Bandit

- grab an e-bike or kayak and hit the lake if it’s a nice weather weekend.  Lake Monona is great for this and it’s pretty affordable

"&gt;But think of how busy Milwaukee street is even though it's a residential road. 

Milwaukee is a minor arterial road and not just a neighborhood street. It goes basically from the city limits to the start of the isthmus. It intersects and gives access to 2 different highways. If you know Aberg, Washington, Milwaukee, cottage Grove Rd, and arguably buckeye you can basically navigate the entire East Side of Madison. It stretches about 6 miles and in some places is 4 lanes. 

The road extension being discussed is only 750ft. It creates zero shortcuts or more convenient routes. The neighborhood isn't connected to any attractions by road. Unless they plan on extending nakoosha trail so that it is one continuous road no one would even know this road exists. People aren't going to pop into the neighborhood because there is new pavement. 

There are arguments to be made about taking away green space but trying to frame this as something that is going to turn that street into a busy road like Milwaukee street is either intentionally disingenuous or ignorance to the highest degree.",reddit,isthmus

Expanded bus service is coming to Verona, with an eye on helping Epic Systems staff and those in need of paratransit.

Route D2 will see regular daytime service and move away from its current schedule of peak hour service in the early morning and later afternoon. The service expansion aims to provide more transit to hourly Epic staff who can’t currently use the route outside of peak hours, Metro Transit General Manager Justin Stuehrenberg said.

By Verona, Route D2 currently extends down to McKee Road and Maple Grove Drive and travels back to Downtown Madison along Nakoma Road and Monroe Street.

Once the expansion is launched, D2 will run all the way to Epic’s campus between the start of service and 7 p.m. on weekdays. Talks are ongoing with the health software company for how the route will complement Route 75, which currently serves the campus, said Mick Rusch, Metro’s spokesperson.

Metro will be releasing more details about the expansion during an early April meeting of the city’s Transportation Commission.

The expanded line will be funded by about $296,000 from Verona and a $320,000 federal planning grant. Four new bus drivers will have to be hired to launch the expanded service, in addition to a new mechanic, dispatcher, utility worker and parts clerk, according to city budget documents.

The service expansion also brings paratransit to the route, which is not required for routes that only run during peak hours. Metro’s paratransit service helps individuals with disabilities who cannot use Metro’s accessible fixed-route bus service. 

Madison’s City Council approved changes to Metro’s budget to accommodate the new service on Tuesday.",reddit,downtown

FACTS:
INITIAL INCIDENT
On April 28, 2025, at approximately 6:36 PM, Cottage Grove Police Sergeant Jessica Frutiger
responded to the report of a single vehicle vs. multiple pedestrians crash that occurred near
the 1300 block of Landmark Drive in the Village of Cottage Grove, Dane County, Wisconsin.
Sergeant Jessica Frutiger reports that upon arrival at the location of the crash she observed
three pedestrians, and a dog had been struck by a vehicle while walking near the Grand
Appliance building on Landmark Drive.
VICTIMS IDENTIFIED
Sergeant Frutiger reports that one of the pedestrians, an adult female later identified as KAH,
appeared to have been struck by the vehicle and was thrown approximately 25-30 feet.
Sergeant Frutiger reports that it appeared that KAH’s body had struck the side of the Grand
Appliance building. KAH was transported by Deer Grove EMS to the University of Wisconsin
Hospital.
Cottage Grove Police Officer Brandon Phillips reports that he was dispatched to the crash on
Landmark Drive and arrived at the scene at approximately 6:40 PM. Upon arrival, Officer
Phillips reports making contact with one of the pedestrians that was struck. This pedestrian,
Juvenile Victim 1, was lying on his right side near the curb next to the street. Officer Phillips
reports Juvenile Victim 1 had a large laceration on his arm and was conscious. Officer Phillips
reports that he provided medical attention to Juvenile Victim 1 until he was transported by EMS
to the hospital.
Sergeant Frutiger reports that the third pedestrian that was involved in the crash was identified
at PPH. Sergeant Frutiger reports that PPH was struck by the vehicle, however, did not require
immediate medical attention for his injuries.
Sergeant Frutiger ultimately learned that KAH and PPH were married, and Juvenile Victim 1
was their child.
Sergeant Frutiger reports that in addition to striking KAH, PPH, and Juvenile Victim 1, the
suspect vehicle had also appeared to strike the family’s dog. This dog was later identified as a
black, pit-bull terrier. Sergeant Frutiger reports the dog was found dead upon her arrival at the
scene.

INVESTIGATION INTO THE CRASH
Cottage Grove Police Detective Brian Carter reports he responded to the above-stated scene
of the crash shortly after the pedestrians had been transported to the hospital. Det. Carter
reports observing the victims’ shoes in two different locations near the east sidewalk of
Landmark Drive. Det. Carter reports it appeared to him that the pedestrians were ejected from
their shoes when they were struck by the vehicle. Det. Carter reports the roadway was dry and
the weather was cloudy. Det. Carter reports that he observed tire track impressions leading
through the grass to the sidewalk on Landmark Drive. Det. Carter reports seeing blood and
black tire marks on the curb and sidewalk.
Officer Nordskog reports that she spoke to PPH at the UW Hospital the night of April 28, 2025.
PPH stated that he was on an evening walk with his family that evening. PPH reported that as
the family walked down Landmark Drive the family was on the east sidewalk near the Grand
Appliance building. PPH stated he was on the left, KAH was in the middle, and Juvenile Victim
1 was on the right (closest to the road).
PPH stated that as they were walking, he heard a vehicle accelerating and he looked up to see
the grey Chevrolet Traverse “flooring it” in their direction. PPH stated he watched the vehicle
accelerate and drive over the curb directly at the family. PPH stated the vehicle drove “straight
into us.” PPH stated it appeared the vehicle was accelerating as it hit the curb, and it went
flying over the curb “like he never hit the brakes.” PPH stated that his leg was grazed by the
vehicle, and he ended up on the ground. PPH stated that when he looked up, he observed his
son, Juvenile Victim 1, lying near the road moaning in pain.
PPH stated that another one of his children, Juvenile Victim 2, observed the entire incident
from the backyard of the family’s home across the street. PPH stated that Juvenile Victim 2 ran
over to PPH and said, “he tried to hit you.” PPH estimated the speed of the vehicle to be at
least 40 miles per hour.
PPH reports that he recognized the vehicle that had hit them and observed “Jeff” crawling out
of the vehicle after the crash. PPH stated to Det. Carter on May 2, 2025 that “Jeff” was a
neighbor that was a close friend of the family until recently. PPH stated “I’m confident he was
intentionally trying to kill us or [Juvenile Victim 1] at least.”
On May 2, 2025, PPH was interviewed by Det. Carter to obtain more information about the
crash. Det. Carter asked PPH additional questions about seeing “Jeff” after the crash. PPH
stated that he saw the driver sitting against the wall of Grand Appliance after the driver crawled
out of the vehicle. PPH stated the driver looked like Jeffrey Endres sitting against the wall.
PPH recognized the driver as Jeffrey Endres after seeing the vehicle and the driver’s face.
PPH recalled Jeffrey Endres having a “smug look on his face” while he was sitting against the
wall. PPH stated he was a long way away from Jeffrey Endres when he saw his face, but did
not feel that Jeffrey Endres was displaying a normal reaction to what had just occurred.
PPH felt the crash was intentional due to the engine revving. PPH stated that there was no
reason a vehicle would jump the curb at that location. PPH did not recall hearing tires
squealing or horn honking. PPH recalled hearing an engine revving, the sound of the vehicle
4
Case 2025CF001064 Document 2 Filed 05-05-2025 Page 5 of 7
STATE OF WISCONSIN - VS - Jeffrey M Endres
bouncing over the curb, and then an extremely loud bang as the vehicle hit the fence and
building. PPH does not recall hearing any other vehicles around the time of the crash. PPH
stated the revving sound of the vehicle that struck them sounded like someone punching the

attention and caused him to look up.
CONTACT WITH WITNESSES
Dane County Sheriff’s Office Detective William Hendrickson reports that he was assigned to
assist in the crash scene investigation on the evening of April 28, 2025. Det. Hendrickson
reports that he responded to the Landmark Drive scene and began to speak with witnesses to
the crash.
Det. Hendrickson reports he spoke with a witness identified as ALM. ALM stated that she was
in her driveway at the time of the crash. ALM stated that she first noticed the grey SUV
involved in this incident traveling north on Landmark Drive while “absolutely flying” and
traveling “very fast.” ALM stated that while it was quite common to see vehicles speeding on
Landmark Drive, it was nothing like the speed she observed the SUV traveling. ALM estimated
the speed of the SUV at 60 mile per hour at least. The speed limit on Landmark Drive was
noted by Det. Hendrickson to be 25 miles per hour. ALM stated that the vehicle left the
roadway, struck a curb, and entered the grass near the sidewalk. ALM stated she lost sight of
the vehicle at that point. ALM stated that she did not see the SUV strike the pedestrians;
however, she heard it and immediately rendered aid.
Det. Hendrickson spoke to another witness to the crash, identified as SEM. SEM reports that
he was driving for Uber at the time of the crash and witnessed the incident on Landmark Drive.
SEM spoke to Det. Hendrickson by phone on the evening of April 28, 2025. SEM advised that
he was driving north on Landmark Drive and noticed the suspect vehicle accelerating at a high
rate of speed behind him. SEM reports that he was concerned looking in his rearview mirror
that the suspect vehicle was moving so fast it may hit his vehicle from behind. SEM reports
that as the suspect vehicle was gaining on him from behind, he increased his vehicle’s speed
to approximately 40 miles per hour. SEM described the suspect vehicle as a dark colored SUV
that was involved in the crash that evening.
SEM stated that he observed a family of three on the sidewalk near Landmark Drive walking a
dog. SEM stated that he continued to observe the suspect vehicle approaching him from
behind. SEM stated that he observed the suspect vehicle “jerk” and drive directly into the
victims walking on the sidewalk. SEM stated that it seemed that the vehicle may have tried to
hit the pedestrians. Det. Hendrickson asked SEM if what he was telling him was that he did not
believe that the suspect vehicle had simply veered off the roadway, and SEM’s response was,
""If he's telling you he veered off the roadway, then he's lying to you. I saw that vehicle jerk.""
SEM went on to say that the suspect vehicle went ""straight into them,"" referring to the
pedestrians.
MOTIVE
In an interview with Det. Carter on May 2, 2025, PPH stated that his family and the Endres
family had a positive relationship until recently. The two families were neighbors, and both
resided in homes on Landmark Drive. PPH recalled that their children were on the same

gymnastics team. PPH’s family and the Endres family would carpool to practices and meets.
The children had been friends and played together regularly and were considered best friends.
PPH reported the adults in the two families had also been friendly until recently.
PPH stated that the relationship between the two families changed drastically in late March of
2025. At that time, PPH stated that an allegation of a sensitive crime arose in which his son,
Juvenile Victim 1, was accused of a sensitive crime involving the defendant’s minor child. PPH
stated that following these allegations, there was a “no contact” between the families.
In March of 2025, Cottage Grove Police Officer and School Resource Officer Zenas Lee was
assigned to investigate the sensitive crime involving Juvenile Victim 1 and the defendant’s
minor child. Officer Lee reports that he and other investigators were in the process of
examining numerous cell phones of students at a local middle school regarding an unrelated
investigation. During the examination of those phones, Officer Lee reports several videos that
were discovered on the phone belonging to Juvenile Victim 1 that appeared to be the
victimization of the defendant’s minor child. An investigation was conducted by the Cottage
Grove Police Department and ultimately a juvenile court proceeding was commenced.
PPH stated he participated in a court hearing over Zoom on Friday, March 28, 2025 involving
his son, Juvenile Victim 1. PPH recalled the defendant appearing and being distraught. PPH
stated the defendant stated that he did not want Juvenile Victim 1 to be released anywhere
near the residence or in the neighborhood. Your complainant is aware that Juvenile Victim 1
was ultimately released from custody and allowed to remain in the family home on Landmark
Drive while court proceedings continued.
Cottage Grove Police Lieutenant Matthew Wagner reports that on April 23, 2025, the
defendant contacted the Village of Cottage Grove Police by email and made an open records
request for the police reports involving the incident with his minor child and Juvenile Victim 1.
The email from the defendant stated “We would like a copy of the police report for case
2025JV… We are the victims parents.” Your complainant is aware that the case number
referenced in the defendant’s email is the Dane County Juvenile case number involving the
crime alleged against Juvenile Victim 1 in which the defendant’s minor child is the alleged
victim.
This request was made five days prior to the crash at issue in this complaint.
Lt. Wagner reports that on April 28, 2025, at 3:43 PM, a staff member of the Village of the
Cottage Grove Police Department responded to the email sent by the defendant. In this email,
the Village of Cottage Grove Police provided the defendant with a redacted set of police
reports of the incident involving his minor child and Juvenile Victim 1.
Your complainant has reviewed the redacted set of reports provided to the defendant. The
redactions eliminated the names of the various juveniles involved. In PPH’s statement to Det.
Carter, it was clear that the defendant was aware of the identity of Juvenile Victim 1 and knew
him to be the suspect in the victimization of his minor child. The reports provided by the Village
of Cottage Grove Police to the defendant contained detailed descriptions of videos purporting
to show the victimization of the defendant’s minor child by Juvenile Victim 1.

If the unit has hot water baseboard heat, it's usually from one furnace or boiler shared by the entire building and your electric bills will be more acceptable. In that case you might be billed for electric lights and the kitchen stove in your individual unit but not get a separate heat bill.

Aging facilities of an established district are gonna be higher and need more staff to maintain. Costs for staff of diverse communities will be higher where who more specialization is required than let’s say a more culturally monotone district of Stevens Point.  So yes, costs per pupil will be much higher in Milwaukee compared to other statewide metrics.  

And if we want to expand beyond the potlical lens. How about we just call out anti education types for what they are.  If you want reasonable reform, sure.. let’s hear specifics, not generalized brush strokes.

"I think Whitewater at a 25min commute is the stand-out option here.

If you're looking for a social scene with a crowd anywhere near your age, Grad students are the only plentiful option short of Madison, Milwaukee, or Chicago.

The university is the draw here.  The amenities are excellent; they've got everything you'd expect: gym, pool, indoor track, theater and music, sports, etc. It helps that the facilities are *significantly* higher quality than privatized competition at a fraction of the price.  Whitewater's downtown is quaint while serving the dual purpose of college bars and townie restaurants.  Despite it's size, it doesn't feel *that* small because population density.  Like all college towns it largely turns into a ghost of itself in summer.

If you're comfortable with a bit longer commute, Greenfield (somewhere near-ish I-43) would put you at a 40 minute commute to be on the edge of the Milwaukee suburbs.  Adding 10 more minutes would give you more Milwaukee options and open up the near side of Madison.  Also, Kenosha which has a rail connection to Chicago.  Personally, 25min already feels like a long commute, but it's whatever you're comfortable with.

Why I wouldn't even consider these options:  Janesville is a stroad lined with big box stores and surrounded by light blue suburbia.  It's sprawl incarnate, surrounded by corn.  Lake Geneva is hella touristy.  They're trying to give Chicagoland residents a taste of the north woods without having to travel 7+ hours to get it.

PROLOGUE – A SPRING EVENING SHATTERED

Just after 6:30 p.m. on Monday, April 28, 2025, the quiet hum of Landmark Drive in Cottage Grove, Wisconsin, was broken by the roar of a gray Chevy Traverse. Witnesses would later describe the SUV as “absolutely flying,” estimates ranging from 40 to 60 m.p.h. in a 25-mile zone. One Uber driver trailed ahead watched the vehicle “jerk” off the roadway and barrel onto the sidewalk where the Hansen family—Paul, his wife Dr. Kami Hansen, their 13-year-old son, and the family’s black pit-bull—were finishing an evening walk. Seconds later Kami lay gravely injured, her son bleeding, the dog lifeless, and the Traverse lay on its roof against the Grand Appliance warehouse. The driver, neighbor Jeffrey M. Endres, crawled from the wreckage and, by one account, sat with a “smug look on his face.”

⸻

PART I – THE TIES THAT BIND

Two Families, One Street

The Hansens and the Endreses had been more than neighbors; their children were gymnastics teammates, the parents car-pooled, and weekend barbecues were common. 681908fc92a9e.pdf.pdf](file-service://file-M1R7yp8B8f8Pd2id9iSu19)  That bond ruptured in late March 2025 when police investigators, combing students’ phones for an unrelated case, discovered videos that appeared to show Endres’s younger child being victimized by the Hansens’ son. A juvenile-court hearing on March 28 allowed the accused boy to remain at home—steps from the Endres residence—despite Jeffrey Endres’s impassioned plea to move him elsewhere.

A Father’s Obsession

From that moment, friends say Endres spiraled. Public records show he filed an open-records request on April 23 for the full police report, receiving a redacted copy at 3:43 p.m. on April 28—less than three hours before the crash.   Reddit commentators would later speculate that reading the explicit report “sent him over the edge,” though no one can confirm what, if anything, in those pages became the final trigger.

⸻

PART II – IMPACT

The Collision

Paul Hansen recalled hearing an engine “flooring it,” then the sound of metal and concrete as the SUV left the pavement “like he never hit the brakes.” 681908fc92a9e.pdf.pdf](file-service://file-M1R7yp8B8f8Pd2id9iSu19)  The impact threw Kami 25–30 feet into the warehouse wall; she died in surgery at 8:24 p.m. 681908fc92a9e.pdf.pdf](file-service://file-M1R7yp8B8f8Pd2id9iSu19)  Their son sustained a concussion, lacerated tendons, extensive road rash and will spend weeks in immobilization. 681908fc92a9e.pdf.pdf](file-service://file-M1R7yp8B8f8Pd2id9iSu19)

Immediate Aftermath

Officer Evan Tapp found Endres leaning against a retaining wall, bloodied but coherent. Asked what happened, he replied he was “having a bad day” and offered “no comment.” He also disclosed recent suicidal thoughts to medical staff. 681908fc92a9e.pdf.pdf](file-service://file-M1R7yp8B8f8Pd2id9iSu19)

⸻

PART III – THE LEGAL ODYSSEY

Date	Event
Apr 28, 2025	Crash and initial hospitalization
Apr 29	Community vigil; petition launched to reinstall stop sign at Landmark Dr. &amp; Michelle Ln.
May 1	Endres arrested after release from hospital; booked into Dane Co. Jail  ￼
May 5	Prosecutors file upgraded charges: 1° intentional homicide, two counts of attempted homicide, mistreatment of animals
May 6	Endres found unresponsive in jail cell, pronounced dead—an apparent suicide.

Deputy DA William Brown told the court the crash was “essentially an act of vigilante justice.”  ￼  Bail was set at $1 million; the case never reached trial.

⸻

PART IV – GRIEF, ANGER &amp; RUMOR

Community Response

Cottage Grove awoke to memorial flowers and stuffed animals lining the scorched sidewalk. Heartbroken patients praised Kami Hansen—a chiropractor, Chamber of Commerce board member, and mother of three—for her “comforting smile.”   The Chamber and local foundation launched a relief fund for medical and funeral costs.

The Reddit Mirror

Within hours, r/madisonwi exploded with theories: some posters empathized with “a dad failed by the system,” others decried “vigilante murder.” One widely up-voted comment summed up the ambivalence: “This wasn’t road rage… It’s a man who felt the system failed his child and took things into his own hands — at terrible cost.”

Jail-Death Questions

Endres became the fifth Dane County inmate to die in 18 months, reigniting criticism of jail mental-health protocols. Officials have not released camera footage, citing an active investigation; early leaks suggest suicide by hanging, though the sheriff’s office will only confirm “no obvious signs of foul play.”

⸻

PART V – WHAT REMAINS

The Hansen family now navigates rehab appointments and funeral planning. A Legacy.com obituary, posted four days after the crash, remembers Kami for “putting healing before profit and people before everything.”

Landmark Drive still lacks a stop sign, though the petition has surpassed 700 signatures. State lawmakers propose a bill to let juvenile-crime victims’ parents seek expedited protective orders when alleged offenders live nearby—a direct response to this case.

Meanwhile, the juvenile proceedings—sealed by law—continue in Dane County’s juvenile court. Whether those hidden hearings will ever satisfy the public’s questions is doubtful. In Cottage Grove, two intertwined families, once friendly, are now forever defined by the moment a father crossed the curb.

⸻

EPILOGUE – LESSONS AND UNKNOWNS
	•	Justice vs. Vigilantism: The case lays bare the razor-thin line between parental instinct and unlawful revenge.
	•	Juvenile-court Secrecy: Critics argue that opaque juvenile processes, though designed to protect minors, can fuel misinformation and rage.
	•	Jail Mental-Health Care: Endres’s custodial death underscores perennial gaps in suicide prevention behind bars.

As the sun sets over Landmark Drive, stuffed animals fade and chalked prayers wash away. Yet the central question endures: when systems appear to fail, how do we stop grief from mutating into violence? The Cottage Grove tragedy offers no easy answers—only a cautionary tale written in skid marks and sorrow.

"Spare some change? Full disclaimer up front:  I'm a bleeding heart type who fights as much as I can to help the less fortunate.  I've helped feed the food insecure during holidays, I've advocated for fixing the massive wealth disparity and yes, I've given whatever money I have in my pockets to people asking on the streets.

But I live on the west side, close to the border with Middleton and it sure seems like the amount of people asking for help are multiplying.  And they also seem to be getting much more aggressive.  Usually when someone asks for money, I smile politely and tell them ""sorry"" and they say thanks anyways and that's the end of it.  I just went to pick up a sandwich at Wendy's and a guy met me as I got out of my car and asked over and over for whatever I can spare all the way to the door.  After I got my food, he met me in my way out and begged again and again on the short walk back to my car but this time had a friend with him.  A guy on each side!  And honestly, for the first time in a long while I sincerely didn't feel safe in Madison.

Here's the thing, I'm also currently having a tough time even paying rent.  There's a strong chance I may no longer have a job after ""DOGE"" gets done with its sweep and I work full time.  So there's a chance one of those guys could be me, and soon.  I still live this city and its people, warts and all.  But has this gotten worse lately, or is it just my imagination?

One of the hardest parts though is knowing both where to go and more importantly, “What do I order!?”.  To aid others in this quest, I’m sharing some of my personal favorites.  Many things left off this otherwise exhausting list for “reasons”, but hopefully it steers at least one person to a new favorite 🤞 

And please share your favorite/s too!

"I think if you are moving to Madison with her, and she is staying in the dorms, to pick a suburb or be within 30 min or at least on a bus route if she won’t have a car- which in Madison a bike and a bus pass are sufficient.      

If you are both going to live together, I also recommend the east side or downtown for the vicinity to school and amenities.      

Even if she wants you there, after the first couple of weeks, taper off on visits and let her dictate visits- she may just need you as a security blanket more than a visit all the time. Set a night for dinner at least once a week and go from there. As the semester progresses she will be more and more busy and you will inevitably find a bit of social life of your own.

Easy walk to downtown Middleton for the library,  shopping (we miss Willy co-op so much) parks and restaurants. Also close to bike paths for a ride to Lake Mendota.

If art/culture is your jam, easy ride/cab/uber to Madison for exhibits, concerts, plays, etc. We saw so many great acts, especially after we moved closer to Madison.  Hubs even did his Masters in project management at UW during this time.

I’ll second living in Monona. Especially close to cottage grove road/Dean road. There are lots of condos/apartments on the lake or a quick walk from the lake. There are TONS of parks and it gives you a sense of being removed for the city while still being walking distance from great bars and food. Great music and the Capitol scene is a bike ride or uber away AND it’s a 15 min drive from campus (I commute every day). When we moved here we were worried it was going to be “too far” and Monona has exceeded our expectations in every way. Gives you the distance to have your life while still being a call away from your daughter. It would also offer her a great retreat when she needs a break from campus/downtown. Also congrats to both of you on your move. You’re going to love Madison.,reddit,downtown

We have parked away from downtown and Uber'ed for football games etc, which was nice.  Ironically, when I was a student I had a car there my whole student career and never had a problem.

"Let’s clarify something. There’s the East Side of Madison—areas like Atwood, Willy Street, and the Marquette neighborhood—which are actually highly sought-after, full of character, restaurants, parks and festivals. Then there’s the Far East Side, closer to Sun Prairie and East Towne Mall, which is often what people are referring to when they talk about safety concerns. The Far East Side has a higher concentration of apartment complexes and more affordable housing, which can sometimes lead to negative connotations. Additionally, some confusion arises with the North Side, especially around Warner Park. While people often lump it in with the East Side, it’s actually the North Side, and it has its own distinct reputation, partly due to a high density of low-income housing in that area.",reddit,willy street

"Here are some questions:

(1) Regarding noise, would you rather have all your neighbors be undergrads or all your neighbors be little children? (This may happen if you move to the Vilas area)

(2) How likely do you think you'd be out after 11:30pm? When you may not be able to travel by bus (I faced a 50 dollar Uber ride on Halloween night once! Scariest thing of the season)

(3) Are you comfortable biking in the winter? I tend not to be, though I just have a regular bike not an e-bike. Madison has plenty of bike paths, so being hit by a car is not likely (though I'd be careful at night).

(4) Honestly anywhere you live you'll be closeish to trails and parks. Madison is surprisingly outdoor-friendly.

(5) If you want under 1200 you may have to settle for an efficiency (source: I pay 1055 for a studio on Willy Street!) or get a roommate (your program may have some means of contact between incoming students).

(6) I'd anticipate moving after one year, particularly since you may have to rent an apartment for your first year without seeing it in person.  Are you ok with that? Would you be taking a scouting trip to madison (which, depending on your location, may cost up to 1500 dollars, so it's kind of only worth it to shave off $125 from monthly rent)?

(7) I would say another thing to be concerned about is construction, but honestly anywhere you live there will be construction near it, so be prepared for that.

"Madison Grocery Problem My wife and I moved back to Wisconsin in August after living 7 years out west. We both are from Madison and bought a house in Sun Prairie in October… we have come to a fairly weird conclusion and I’m wondering if anyone else has noticed it 

1. There is an unreal amount of different type of grocery stores in the metro Madison area.

Just off the top of my head I count 15 including the Costco , wal marts of the world

Trader Joe’s 
Whole Foods
Pick n save
Woodmans
Metro market
Costco
Aldi 
Target
Walmart 
Fresh mart
Hyvee 
Festival
Willy street co-op
Brennan’s  
Metcalfe’s 

It just seems like there are an insane amount of different grocery stories

2. It’s a musical chair in terms of what certain stories have 

For example this week my wife and I have come across it at different stories

I went to Aldi to get their grass fed ground beef and they were completely out of a pretty desirable, non unique item and my wife went to Trader Joe’s and it was completely cleaned out of a lot of items

It’s quite baffling",reddit,willy street

"Successful Stolen Bike Recovery On Wednesday, September 25th at around 12:00pm, my bike was stolen outside of the Nicholas Rec Center. My initial though was “I’m never going to see that bike again, but damn whoever stole it must be pretty stupid to do that in the middle of the day with all the security cameras around campus” (I was 50% correct).

As recommended, I filed a police report with the UWPD and an insurance claim through my renters insurance. Within an hour, I got a call from a UW police officer saying that they were able to obtain footage of the thief cutting my lock and riding away on my bike. The officer said “there are over 3000 security cameras around campus and state street so we’ll try to track the thief” which got my hopes up for recovery. 4 days went by without any word from UW police so my hopes of ever seeing my bike again started to dwindle… until I got a call yesterday evening from a different UW police officer. This officer stated that, using the security camera footage, they were able to track the thief and watched him load my bike into a car. UWPD was able to run the cars license plate, figure out who the thief was, get in contact with his parole officer (yep, guy was on parole and committed a crime in broad daylight while on camera). From there, the UWPD picked up my bike and brought it to my apartment. Maybe I was “lucky” because my bike was stolen where there were a lot of cameras and that the person who stole my bike was on parole so it was easy for the police to identify and get in contact with him. 

Morale of the story: if you value your bike, don’t use a cable lock. And if you do decided to use a cable lock, get an AirTag or some type of tracker for when your bike does get stolen. Also, file that police report and insurance claim ASAP",reddit,downtown

"There are two choices that are obvious picks. Seattle and Washington DC. Seattle is also constrained by an isthmus and has a population of 750,000 and a density of 9,000/sq. mi. That ranks it as the 19th most dense in the US. Washington DC has the ""Height of Buildings Act"" that limits it's buildings to 160 ft. It has a population density of 11,000. Compare both of those to Madison and it's population density of 3,300 (80th in density in US). So, height limit and isthmus aren't necessarily as large of constraints as we make it. Hell, Madison is less dense than Omaha and Columbus. I don't think anyone is suggesting Madison should turn into Manhattan, but there is room for growth. 

Population density is also fairly compact in Madison. A lot of Madison is not dense and is largely. There are areas on the isthmus itself that have very low owner-occupancy and also low density (like Broom to Proudfit, West Wash to Nolen). Then there is the fact that the land that East Towne mall is similar in land area to downtown. You could fit a whole lot of people in a bunch of areas. 

Even Soglin agrees. Here are some quotes from his latest opinion piece ""I additionally wanted to increase zoning density along major commercial corridors based on community input to the 2013 Zoning Code Rewrite and the neighborhood plans."" and ""High rises everywhere are not necessary.

"There are plenty of comments in here around the commute being such a big driver to making your decision. I don't necisarily disagree, but I think in Madison, quality of life matters, and where you live heavily impacts that.

I was in your spot about 2 years ago. Lived and worked in Fitchburg. Couldn't walk anywhere. All my friends were downtown. Every trip took 20-30 minutes. It really hampered my lifestyle outside of the convenience of working 2 miles away.

Moved to the nearest side, and I can tell you that this move has been the best decision of my life in recent memories! I get that I increased my commute from 5 minutes to 30, but everything else is so much better. I walk everywhere, people in the community are amazing, I bike to work without fear of dying.

Before I had to drive 10-minutes to a grocery store, now I have at least 3 I can walk/bike to in 5 minutes or less. I'm minutes from my favorite brewery, and I feel like I make more of an effort to see people more and do more outdoor activities.

I do agree that Monroe would be perfect for you, especially given that Alimentari just opened up over there lol but it also has a similar vibe while being more convenient for your commute.

Even where there are multi use buildings, many have very high turnover or fail completely to fill out the first floor. For instance, that place at the end of Willy street has been empty since it was built (which I skeptically assume is due to some “dark store” benefit). 

I was happy to see in the Essen house plans the “living street” approach and mixed income housing.

I moved here for that big healthcare software company roughly 4.5 years ago but quit after 2 years. Since then, I've found another job very close to my apartment and I've continued living around junction Rd/mineral point area.

Recently, I've been going out more trying to meet new people outside my board game friend group. It seems that all the cool, fun places I visit happen to be downtown and near the East side. I'm interested in pottery, board games, cooking, trying out new food, stand-up and improv, hiking around nature - many of which have outlets on the East side.

Driving downtown or to Willy Street takes roughly 20-30 minutes any time I want to go out and meet people. In my area right now, it's all suburbs and there don't seem to be places to meet people my age. All the shopping and restaurants around me are just chains, and there aren't really any good ""third spaces"" to hang out in

As much as I thought I could enjoy a short commute, I'm starting to think I'd take a 1 hour round trip commute if it meant being able to easily interact with like-minded people easily on weekdays and weekends. 

Right now, I'm paying $1600/mo for a 800sq feet 1 bed apartment. A quick glance at apartment prices tells me I'd likely be paying a few hundred more for the same thing on the East side. But maybe it's worth it?

When I moved to Madison a few years ago, I just searched up ""Williamson Street"" on Youtube on a whim, hoping to find some videos of people walking around where I'd be moving to.

Instead I came across this sweet old couple singing a song they had written together about living on Willy Street in their youth. It was funny, charming, and sweet. I clicked on their profile and saw he had also written a song called ""The Erectile Dysfunction Polka"", which is an absolute banger and I've been singing it to myself for years now.

Long story short - I genuinely love these two and will always think about them when I think about Madison after I move away. Due to their age and the fact that Paul started posted solo videos before eventually stopping about 6 years ago, I have a feeling that these two may have passed on.

"I asked ChatGPT for examples of cities where increased property taxes had adverse affects on the community.   
I did not tell ChatGPT where I live or provide any personal info. I thought it was interesting that it called out major American metropolises like New York, Seattle, SF, but then also....Madison?! I've only been here a short time so I don't know if Willy street has actually undergone these changes or not but I thought it was amusing to see these results.

&gt;  
Yes, several cities have seen negative outcomes following significant property tax increases. For example, Seattle and New York City experienced adverse effects on local communities, with increased property taxes playing a role in accelerating gentrification and displacing long-term residents from historically lower-income neighborhoods. Increases in property taxes, especially when tied to rapid property value appreciation, often result in rent hikes for tenants and higher costs for homeowners, leading to displacement pressures on those with lower incomes.  
  
In San Francisco, rising property values have led to increased tax revenues but have also exacerbated affordability issues, pushing out many low- and middle-income residents. Similar effects have been observed in Madison, Wisconsin, where tax increases and development projects have made certain areas, such as the Willy Street neighborhood, unaffordable for long-time residents. This shift has contributed to a socio-economic homogenization that replaces the neighborhood's cultural character with a ""socioeconomic mono-culture"" dominated by wealthier new residents. Madison, like many cities undergoing similar transformations, saw rent burdens increase as property taxes and rents rose, impacting nearly half of all renters who were then classified as ""housing cost-burdened,"" paying over 30% of their income on rent.

&gt;In these cases, the drawbacks often outweighed the benefits, particularly for vulnerable populations. While higher property taxes can fund public services and infrastructure, they can also lead to long-term changes in neighborhood demographics, cultural erosion, and financial strain for lower-income residents, forcing them to relocate to more affordable but potentially less desirable areas.",reddit,willy street

"Madison is made beautiful by the lakes but it also creates choke points for traffic, available land and development. 

Outside developers, which is where the money is found, prefer to build downtown on the Isthmus knowing that there is a constant student demand for housing and they will likely see their investment increase in value every year. It's low risk in that sense. 

But the land is really expensive which reduces the number of projects and makes the ""missing middle"" projects financially challenging. 

Big money investors that fund large projects are looking at every city in the USA for an opportunity and in other parts of the world to deploy capital. Investment banks have setup funds to deploy capital against housing and it's very easy for them to buy existing homes versus build something. Capital is deployed in weeks and month and revenue is coming back in that same time frame. 

There are fewer local developers and they also look outside of Madison.

I sat down and had a cogent and thoughtful conversation with Reggie, who is a really good person with an interesting history.  I think a lot of times this subreddit discusses the homeless problem downtown, this community is treated like a monolith that's just running around screaming at people and shitting in doorways.

"In deciding between Boulders and Greater Heights, your two main considerations should be rope route length and overall climbing space.

I've been a Boulders member for years. Downtown is a really solid bouldering gym. Walls are on the short side for bouldering, but they do a great job of using the space and wall angles they have to make engaging, thoughtful climbs. I've visited gyms around the country and found the setting at Boulders to be topnotch, though they've had some turnover lately and are working through the kinks that involves. This also maybe doesn't (and shouldn't) matter to you that much being quite new. But it will eventually.

Their east side location has ropes and boulders, but it was built decades ago and the rope walls are admittedly kind of pitiful. You have to work pretty purposefully to get a legit pumpy rope session in, but it is possible. The main benefit of the east side location imo is simply the additional bouldering real estate, plus the weight room, which itself is pretty old school. I'm a midday climber to avoid the crowds, and this gym gets overrun by children anytime school is out, so beware.

Greater Heights is the new kid in town. If rope climbing is important to you, this is probably the move, but it's not perfect either. Walls are nearly double Boulders' height but the density of ropes leads to some limitations imo. Much easier to get volume in there. They have bouldering as well, but the space is just as pitiful as the ropes at Boulders. A 3x/week boulderer will definitely get bored there. Nothing against the setting though. I recently got a short-term membership there just to get mileage in for an upcoming trip, and no real complaints, but it would be different if I were using it as a bouldering gym. They do have a more modern weight room and a yoga room.

Even when taking the tall rope walls into account, I believe the ""climbing space"" you get with the two Boulders gyms is nearly twice as much as you get at Greater Heights. ""Bouldering space"" is legit probably 5x with Boulders. I could see someone who does the two disciplines equally opting for Greater Heights. I cannot see a reason a strict boulderer would do so, unless they are REALLY into the adjustable Kilter Board.

Prices are nearly identical.

"Saturday is a perfect day to visit Madison!

Come to the farmer’s market at the square in the early morning. I highly recommend Chris and Lori’s for a morning scone, this will be their last year at the farmer’s market so really worth checking them out. It’s wise to get there before 9a. Lines can be super long otherwise and their likely to sell out before the farmer’s market ends. 

Explore the Capitol if you haven’t been before and then I highly recommended just walking down state street from the Capitol to the terrace at memorial union. You will pass by a ton of shops and restaurants on the way there :) 

Some places in the area for food:
- Ancora for breakfast/brunch + coffee
- Collectivo for coffee
- Parthenon for gyros 
- Dotty Dumpling’s Dowry for burgers 
- Le C’s or Sencha for boba tea 
- Teamoji for boba tea and Korean corn dogs 
- Ian’s for cheap-ish pizza 
- Little Luxuries is a local shop that will have some Madison/WI goods


You will also have two museums on the way to the terrace: The Madison Museum of Contemporary Art and The Chazen Museum of Art. Both are great! 

You can also head outside of the downtown area to Willy St on the east side :) Plenty of good vintage / thrift shops there and really good food too. 

Weary Traveler Free House, Ha Long Bay, and Pig in a Fur Coat are all in the Willy St area and are great restaurants.

First, an important distinction: Fresh cheese curds and deep fried cheese curds.

For the deep fried curds, the ones at The Old Fashioned on the Square are pretty excellent.   
Second, another important distinction: A BRANDY Old Fashioned. Elsewhere whiskey is the norm but not here! You will have the choice of sweet or sour. Try both!   
Third, no one has said Babcock ice cream yet so Babcock Ice Cream. There's a plant on campus for the OG experience or at the Memorial Union. There's some history that goes with this you can learn online or at the plant on campus.   
Fourth, buy some wild rice to take home. Metcalfe's grocery has it. Before we colonized WI and put cows all over it, indigenous people had wonderful food and food ways and many continue. One is wild rice grown and harvested here. Maybe someone else will know a restaurant that serves it.

"Pedestrians, please remember: there are 4-way intersections on the capitol square, and not everyone is turning right! I felt compelled to post this after yet another close call this morning. 

My husband works at the Captiol, and I drive him to and from work every day. The capitol building has 4 “drop off” loops that allow cars to drive underneath the building’s breezeways and drop employees off right by the door. These are located at the West Wash, MLK Jr Blvd, East Wash, and Wisconsin Ave intersections (photo attached of the West Wash intersection). All of these intersections are 4-way intersections, with 4 traffic lights. However, it is much more common for cars going towards the capitol on these streets to turn right onto the square, than it is for them to go straight. 

Because of this, I see pedestrians blatantly disregard their “Do not cross” signal and walk through the intersection in the middle of my green light literally every day. I have had numerous close calls, where I’ve had to slam on my brakes because a runner or walker has their headphones in and jaywalks without even looking. It is terrifying! I’ve also almost been T-boned by a car running their red light on Carroll St, because they assume that nobody is coming. 

As someone who drives this route every day, I am asking yall to please obey traffic/pedestrian laws, and do not cross the street if the sign says not to cross. At the bare minimum, please at least look to see if cars are coming! Do not assume that cars never go straight at these intersections. It only takes a second to look, and doing so can save lives. Sorry for the rant, I’m just terrified that someone is going to get hit one of these days.",reddit,downtown
"The bus system is pretty simple, if you follow the advice people have given you you’ll be fine!

There’s a bunch of public parking garages around the square, they are well labeled, accessible, and cost around the same as bus fares",reddit,downtown

Here's part of the press release we spoammed out:

**Buy Out The Market action to demonstrate the power of our community to respond to the crisis**

Healthy Food For All of Dane County and Wisconsin Resistance Coalition in conjunction with Madison 50501 are calling on rally goers attending this Saturday’s National Day of Action to support our local farmers, help feed needy neighbors and demonstrate how we as a community respond to a crisis. With the Dane County Farmers’ Market back on the Square, having a large rally on the steps isn’t allowed and might also negatively impact vendors’ revenue.

“We’re asking folks not to just gather at the top of State Street, but march around the Capitol then meet up a few blocks away at James Madison Park,” says WRC organizer Anna Gerard. “We’re also asking folks to buy all the food at the Market and immediately donate it to Healthy Food For All to distribute to neighbors who are struggling!”

Buy Out The Market builds on HFFA’s Buy One For A Neighbor project that asks area farmers’ market shoppers to buy an extra bag or bunch of something they’d like to share with neighbors in need. Relying on existing social networks in low income neighborhoods, HFFA does pop-up mobile pantries to quickly distribute large volumes of high quality perishable food directly into low income households. Produce and other food collected at this event will be distributed in Darbo-Worthington, at The Harmony apartment complex and additional Southside locations.

“Madison knows how to take care of its own like the farmers who feed us and our neighbors who are struggling,” says Joe Mingle, HFFA Field Organizer. “People are righteously angry, and we'll never stop fighting back, but we're also moving forward together to make real change on the ground in people’s lives.”

Saturday 04.19 is another National Day of Action with the local event scheduled for 12:00 noon. Rally goers are asked to march around the Square, Buy One For A Neighbor from the farmers and continue to march to James Madison Park. Donations will be gathered and sorted at the Park while marchers network to build working committees and affinity groups. As additional national days of action are called, organizers anticipate Buy Out The Market days will be a regular activity.

“The Dane County Farmers’ Market is the crown jewel of our local food scene and farmers like these are critical to our community’s long term food security,” says Gerard. “We’re proud to show the whole nation a way we can turn our fear and anger into action that reflects the kind of society we want to build.”",reddit,downtown

"I follow my faves on Instagram. That’s been the easiest for me to find where they’re going to be. Of course, this means you’ve got to know your faves in the first place. For that, I recommend trying library mall, Garver, the capitol square, and Fete de Marquette (already happened for 2024).",reddit,downtown
"Every patio, restaurant, bar and coffee shop open between 11am-7pm yesterday on State St and The Square disagrees with you. The people running the race aren't necessarily going out before or after, but most of the weekend warriors doing it for the achievement have large friends and family groups tracking their progress/waiting to cheer them on, and they have nothing to do all day *but* spend money. 

I can speak to the previous paragraph bc I've been in the downtown Madison service industry for 20+ years, and have worked every Ironman Sunday, and I've seen the mania first-hand.

It's cosmetically a great event for the city/Dane County as well. During all those Sundays, scores of visitors have remarked to me how pretty and scenic the general area is, and how the bike course really shows off the rural areas away from Downtown, and how having the finish line ""arena"" adjacent to the Capitol and Monona Terrace is an incredible setting. I'd like to assume one or more of those people running the race looked around and thought, ""hell, I should check this place out for myself some weekend.""

Sure, it screws up traffic and sure, cowbells are noisy and sure, lots of people clog up the sidewalks on State Street. But, like, that means it's a success...? I don't get this city sometimes.",reddit,downtown
"Tornado Madison is probably the most, ""local,' of the steakhouses and a walk/Uber from the hotel. It's also more affordable than the alternatives. The Old Fashioned is also on the Capitol square and is the Disney version of a Wisconsin supper club (I don't mean that in a negative way). Eno Vino on E. Washington has a great view so if only there for a drink it'd be worth it, and Sardine (also on the water) is probably my favorite (it's a French bistro vs a uniquely Madison/Wisconsin them restaurant hence not my first recommendation).

Yeah, and despite the shellacking at the hands of ND last week, your Boilers are likely to give the Badgers all they can handle. I'm immensely curious as to the spread, and would recommend (in addition to the restaurant recommendations) to definitely take the under.",reddit,downtown

Hello this is Ken Fager!

I am here to talk about almost anything… the [Mini WI Project,](https://kenfager.com/miniwi/) [photography](https://flickr.com/photos/kenfagerdotcom/) misadventures, retro computer technology, and being a man who gets around Madison in general.

If you are a r/madisonwi regular you have probably seen posts related to the [Mini WI Project](https://kenfager.com/miniwi/). It is an ongoing public art project that has been sustained since the pandemic thanks to generous donations. The new [Mini Mingo](https://kenfager.com/miniwi/?page_id=323) is now flocking to Little Free Libraries around town. 

My main muse photography has taken me to some pretty wild places over the years. Those include [Chernobyl](https://flickr.com/photos/kenfagerdotcom/albums/72157709446947036), a [Nazi shrine here in Wisconsin](https://flickr.com/photos/kenfagerdotcom/albums/72157711713703656), into the thick of [Trump](https://flic.kr/p/2pYebDN) [rallies](https://flic.kr/p/2m5oXED), Capitol Square [protests](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kenfagerdotcom/albums/72157715634822877), and other [off the beaten path locations](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kenfagerdotcom/collections/72157616600623115/). 

As a serial tinkerer and retro computer enthusiast I’ve either used, owned, or restored a wide variety of unique and sometimes rare computers. Those niche skills sometimes come in handy working in IT at UW-Madison as a person of last resort support. 

If you've got anything else you want to ask me about go right ahead!

"Meter on the square. The capitol square was home to the original ""Camera Company"" in Madison, est. 1977 and stayed in business until 2020. While the building sat vacant for a number of years with no new tenants, it recently met the wrecking ball in early 2025 to make way for the new Wisconsin History Center being placed on the site. I have documented many changes downtown, and this one stings a little bit: Almost like losing an old friend after all the Camera Company was my go-to the five years I lived just a short walk away. I plan on chronically the changes to this spot over the next couple of years as the new structure goes up and think this photo serves as a fond farewell.

I just ran into a guy who decided to ride his bike and nearly hit my dog on Mifflin, who claimed it's legal. As I pointed to the city ordinance posted on literally every other lamp pole on the square, he decided to film me telling him not to ride in the sidewalk because ""have you seen the drivers here?""

"Homelessness around the square and state street/east wash Over a decade long resident living on east wash, bedford, campus and more.

It visually appears that homelessness is much more visible in the area then years past.  

This morning there were 12 benches around the square and on state street, occupied with sleeping bags.  There were two cots out in front of Ian’s on state.  

There were clothes and trash and extension cords from the bus station stop around the square next to subway and in front of the Starbucks off the square.

There was definitely urine on multiple entryways to empty stores and on one, feces being wiped and bleached out by the Capitol Sanitation workers.

What is the future of Madison moving ahead?  I’ve seen and I myself have avoided blocks due to the trash and debris, whether for my dog to avoid or to sometimes avoid someone yelling.  It was about a week ago in front of south Hamilton street that a homeless person swung a bag at my dog for no reason.

The entry to my building recent added security cameras and motion detection lights to deter anyone from sleeping at the entryway.  

Is this trend the future of Madison?  I realize people will say it’s seasonal or not bad.  Anecdotally walking the same streets for 10 plus years, it is at least visibly worse in all seasons than it has felt in the past.

Is there a solution? In reality, this does pose bigger issues like public health, safety, business success/failure, housing

\- Mid/high rise with amenities, the one's I'm interested in are likely considered Madison ""luxury"" apartments. Budget is flexible, it looks like many I'm interested in are around $1700-2000/mo base rent

\- Ideally an area where young professionals are nearby/ not strictly just undergrads or families. 

\- Would love if walking trails or parks are walking distance/nearby. I'm also considering getting a dog

\- Would also love if restaurants, cafes, entertainment are nearby as well, although I will have a car 

\- Madison is pretty safe in general but important to me to feel safe walking around the area

Some areas I've seen nice apartments in/ thinking would be nice areas:

\- Atwood/ east wash apartments nearby

\- Middleton

\- Sun Prairie 

\- Hilldale

\- Bay Creek

Most of the threads I've seen recommended the Atwood area. However, the few people I know in Madison weren't as familiar with the area and I'm struggling to understand the vibe there. I am conflicted on how important being in a busier/ more happening area is if I'll have a car anyways.

"Talk about East side aggressive driving.. Tonight leaving the Kwik Trip on Third street and Pennsylvania, I had started to pull out heading South of 3rd when this blue yaris station wagon turned onto 3rd Street at a pretty good pace.  I had to accelerate to avoid being t-boned by this person.  It should have ended there, but it didn't.  They were right off my bumper and followed me towards my home.  The whole time they were inches from my bumper obviously pissed off at me for supposedly cutting them off.  as I approached the tracks between Main and Winnebago, they turned heading East on Main.. but I stopped to see if they were turning into their home.  They saw this, and came back to following me.  I pulled up on Atwood and First Street pulled over and rolled my window down.  

He was fiddling with something, and taking a long time to roll down his window.  so I moved something I have a license for to a ready position.  I did not physically or visibly brandish or show him I just had it ready because in this day and age, you just don't know what people are capable of.  This guy rolls his window down and is blinding me with this light.  I ask him what his problem is, he says that I was driving too fast on 3rd and he felt like I was stalking him.  I told him, that he was the one tail gating me.  I asked him if it was necessary to be pointing a light in my face and asked him if he'd like me to point a light in his face?  He said something about not wanting to see my penis.. which was odd, as he had a sort of lisp. I just shook my head, backed up to get his license before he ended up almost getting in a wreck to get away from my phone.  

There are somethings I would like to point out to this fella.  One, you do not know me or anyone else for that matter.  Are you a police officer? Do you have brakes on your car?  You lucked out tonight but next time you might not be so lucky.   Take a deep breath and get a grip on your anger.  The way you were acting tonight regardless of the situation which caused it isn't worth becoming an organ donor for.  

I do believe it is wise to relax and let stupid shit slide whenever possible.  I have had some pretty bad experiences with road rage and this guy was no exception.  

Here is another thing I want to point out.  Madison is small, it is very likely I know people that you know and vise versa.  Wouldn't it be interesting if we were neighbors? Wouldn't it be interesting if that light you were shining in my face was a phone taking a video that you are now going to share on social media? 

Wouldn't it be interesting to learn that you have a record or are a known entity with the police for over-reacting?",reddit,atwood

"Madison has tons of good restaurants of all kinds, and many partner with farmers just outside the city to get access to amazingly fresh produce and meat. We have award winning restaurants which will cost you $100+ USD or more to eat dinner at by yourself, and really good pubs and bars where you can spend $20 and get a good sandwich/burger, fries, and a drink. And in the summer, lots of food carts to choose from. 

We have one of the biggest farmer's markets in the country from Spring to Fall on the capitol square each Saturday, and many smaller ones all around town on different days. You can go browse amazing vegetables and other foods from farms all summer long! 

There are dozens of things going on every single day in Madison, many are free to go to. Bookmark this page, and check back often: [https://isthmus.com/search/event/calendar-of-events/#page=1](https://isthmus.com/search/event/calendar-of-events/#page=1)

Will you have a car or another way to get outside of Madison? Madison is surrounded by nature, with hundreds of miles of bike trails, tons of parks and hiking areas, streams, ponds, lakes, and rivers to fish in, etc. If you can get out of the city, there is so much nature to explore. And if you can't really get outside the city, Madison has like 100 parks in the city that you can walk, bike, or take the bus to. 

Madison has pretty good bike lanes and paths. Once it warms up, you should bike around the city, around the lakes, and just go exploring. 

Search this sub - lots of people ask questions like this, and you'll find tons and tons of recommendations.",reddit,downtown
My niece got married in the Capitol Rotunda - it was magical.  Then you can take your pick of restaurants around the square to arrange a private lunch.,reddit,downtown
"Anywhere along University, the capitol, and and East Washington will have easy bus access. Last bus is generally around 11:30pm, unfortunately, but if you're off at 10pm that shouldn't be an issue. Google will let you plan out your bus trips by selecting start and end points, and either leave time or arrive time. 

The reason I say this is that living downtown is EXPENSIVE. You will really want to seriously check out rents and availability, talk to service industry folks, and make sure that you can really do it on a dinner service budget. 

I suspect that will price you out of downtown. Madison is in a huge housing squeeze right now, and rents and mortgages are through the roof. Downtown is the worst. 

There are tons of places to pick up those dinner services around the capitol square - they'll all see some slowdown in the winter, but nowhere near the boom and bust of anything where sales are driven by the college students and/or college sports. Unless it's a blizzard or -20, plenty of people will still be out on Friday and Saturday nights downtown. Just search this sub for restaurant recommendations, and you'll find tons and tons of people talking about their favorites. Then a bit of google/google maps and you're golden. 

Outside of downtown it's a little trickier. The density of restaurants is a lot lower, and you might need to commute a bit further. However, you can find cheaper rent and lean on the bus system, if you're willing to give up some time and convenience. 

The east side tends to be older and smaller, but has a ton more variety. You'll find a lot of little shops, cafes, etc., within walking distance of stuff on the east side. If your goal is to have fun stuff within walking distance, a lot of the east side will suit you nicely. 

The west side tends to be newer and very suburban, with mostly houses for miles. It's far less friendly if you're planning to access stuff on foot on a daily basis. 

However, there are a few places west-side which have a nice little concentration of restaurants and good bus access. The west transfer point for the bus system is on Whitney and Tokay, and right there you'll find a couple restaurants, and easy bus or walking access up Odana to the West Town Mall area. Around University and Midvale you'll find the Hilldale mall, and they have a number of restaurants and easy bus access.  

You might also want to consider Middleton. It's constantly listed as one of the top places to live in the US, downtown is incredibly walkable, and it's just a \~20 minute bus ride to downtown Madison. Middleton has a half dozen very good restaurants that primarily run dinner services. In my experience, those places don't see huge slowdowns in winter - most of their customers are folks living nearby, and even a bit of snow doesn't tend to dissuade people from walking or driving 5-10 minutes to go get dinner.",reddit,downtown
"It’s very walkable and I do it often!  The bike path does run from there to Olbrich and that is what I usually take but the sidewalks along Atwood absolutely work too.  If you go the bike path route you can go up to Walter St for Olbrich park or when you hit the backside of Garver you can take the driveway to the right into the parking lot of Olbrich gardens. And from either you can get on the lake loop to make it more of a circle route, I take that back until the Yaharra and then back to my start. It’s a great walk!",reddit,atwood

"This is entirely the city's fault, and it's not going away. If anything, it will get worse.

Over the past few years, Madison has reduced the speed limit on major streets designed to get people through the city quickly. That hasn't gone unnoticed. If you have to get somewhere, and you've lived here for a while, you typically have been taking those main streets, even if they were out of your way. When they get reduced to 25 or 20 miles an hour, you're going to have a combination of people who drive the posted speed, and those who drive the speed that makes sense on those streets. And that means it's more difficult to get where you're going on them. And the streets where we have the BRT on are more difficult to navigate as well, so that's another factor.

So, people take the side streets much more frequently. And of course, they drive about the same speed on them as they are used to, with the difference being side streets aren't designed for that speed level. It's not safe. But people do what they have to to get where they need to go. I live not too far from Cottage Grove road where it hits Monona drive, and that section of the road has been cut to 25 MPH. To get to places in that neighborhood, I take some of the side streets (and have done that for a long time), but I see people driving much faster and much more frequently on those streets. That's not safe, and it's going to get someone hurt. But at the same time...

...About the same time as Covid hit, if not a little before, Madison stopped enforcing speeding. I remember during Covid I was one of the ten people or so who still worked up by the Capitol every day, so I drove when there was almost no traffic. And people who were out would drive crazy fast. I'd regularly encounter people going 40-50 on the Monona Drive stretch that turns into Atwood. And East Wash was regularly 50+. Now there weren't many people around, but still. That isn't safe. And that lasted since Covid, honestly, to this day. 

So combine reducing speeds with no enforcement? People are going to speed and drive on roads where there is expected to be less traffic.

Not saying this is a good idea in any way, nor that it's safe, just that there is a reason for it. And without major action from the city, it will keep getting worse.",reddit,downtown

"Madison, WI is one of the fittest cities in America according to US News. It's a very bike-friendly city, and there are many water sports options since there are two beautiful lakes. Madison is also within reasonable driving distance of many state parks. 


It's also a big foodie city. It was even featured on Top Chef. Madison has so many fantastic restaurants. There is also the Dane County Farmer's Market, which is held at the Capitol Square and is fantastic. You'll learn that gardening is a popular hobby in the area after visiting the market. One of my favorite things is harvest season because all of my coworkers with surplus garden veggies share them with the office. 😂


Madison is definitely a good choice for families and anyone looking to be free of excessive capitalism. There are obviously the normal chain restaurants and stores around, but they offer convenience for normal errands. Since you have children, I would say to aim for the Middleton-Cross Plains or Waunakee areas for their school districts. Sun Prairie also has a good school district and has the Prairie Atheltic Club, which I think is the best gym in the whole state and has infinite summer fun options for children.

"Missed Connection around Atwood and Division at about 640a.  I was the lead in a group of 3 cars. I was traveling 28mph in a 25. I came to gentle stop at a well marked crosswalk with a pedestrian waiting. 

Car 2 came to a stop, but you car 3 decided that you were too important or maybe they weren't paying attention and were on their phone or doing their makeup in their mirror. 

You decided to race around us. I blew on my horn seeing what was about the happen. The pedestrian was over halfway across the street and your trajectories were going to meet. You continued to accelerate and at the last moment slammed on the brakes. You gave me a look like I was the asshole and then sped off at probably 40mph (in a 25) once the road was clear. 

Your actions show you had zero accountability or self reflection in that moment. You probably went to work and told your coworkers about the asshole you came across on your morning commute. I don't expect a thank you and one isn't necessary but you should know I saved you from a potential manslaughter charger and up to ten years in prison. You were 100% in the wrong. 

Pay attention to the road, and when there are pedestrian signs maybe look for pedestrians. When the speed limit is 25 it is usually because it has high foot traffic area or it is a residential area. 

To the pedestrian that was crossing, I apologize if I startled you. The horn wasn't to make you go faster, it was to get the SUV to stop. Hope the rest of your day is good.

We’ve done the Great Dane at hilldale before but we’re kinda sick of their food/drink offerings and they’re honestly not the most friendly even though we’ve always called beforehand to let them know we were coming in on a future date with a larger group.

"Stay downtown. 

It's going to be a bit of a zoo, with all sorts of folks like yourself coming into town, doing the same thing. Traffic is going to be worse, all the taxi businesses will be getting slammed, and parking will be tight. If you can walk a couple miles, especially with stops for libations, it's easily walkable from the capitol over to the stadium for the show. That will save you tons of headaches. 

As others have said, downtown is fantastic in the summer. Sit at memorial terrace and drink a few beers, watch people swimming and sailing. Do yourself a nice little pub crawl around the capitol square in the other evenings, sit on patios and eat good food, drink good drinks. Wander down to one of the lakes and walk a bit of the lakeshore path. We've got tons of B-cycle stations, where you can rent an electric bike for very little money and go cruising around. 

Every Saturday morning we have the 2nd largest farmer's market in the country happening on the square. Absolutely a Madison treasure, and well worth spending an hour or two meandering through. And the observation deck in the capitol building will let you see the whole town, the lakes, everything. It's fantastic. 

On the square, Eno Vino is way over-priced, but you're paying for the view. Worth heading up for a drink or a quick app just to enjoy. Around King St there's a bunch of great stuff. Tipsy Cow is an awesome dive bar, try the goat cheese curds. Lucille is a wood-fired fancy pizza place. Young Blood Brewing is in between the two, with tons of fun beers, lots of IPAs and sours. Diagonal from Lucille is Marigold Kitchen, a very solid breakfast place. If you keep going down King you'll find the Great Dane, our ""solid B"" homegrown german-inspired brewpub. It's nothing fancy, but they tend to be solid, with a good variety of food. Past that is Nattspil, for your claustrophobic, chaotic, cheap but super eclectic culinary needs. 

Around the square you will find The Old Fashioned, which is a polarizing place. It's ""real wisconsin"", but also, ""really where all the tourists go to see real wisconsin"", so you'll find people on this sub passionately telling you to both go and not to go. Cooper's Tavern is a british football pub, with nice upscale food. Just past that is Teddywedger's, for your hand-pie needs.

"My issues with the race were largely due to the issues that I mentioned above. As another poster pointed out the race organization has changed hands and the new group is apparently doing a better job.

As for the course, I agree that with Madison's relatively small geographic footprint and the fact that it is on an isthmus make it hard to string together 26.2 miles that truly showcase the city. The course for this years race is really nice and doesn't have any of the ""obviously just adding distance"" sections that you sometimes find in marathons. For the most part it is scenic throughout. I think that a clockwise loop around Lake Monona would be preferable; the counter clockwise loop doesn't give runners the great view of downtown from John Nolen.

That said, I think that it would be a nicer tour of the city if it included campus, State Street, Monroe St, something along Lake Mendota, etc. My guess is the amount of streets that would need to be closed/monitored for that type of route is prohibitive and that's why the course relies pretty heavily on paths, sidewalks and roads that have heavy foot traffic (like the arboretum and Waunona Way).

East of the capitol you have Johnson St and Willy/Atwood, both of which have more of an old ""State Street"" feel than  State Street itself. In between these two corridors is East Wash which has developed a LOT in the last few years.

Madison has truly epic bicycle infrastructure. Lots of dedicated bike paths, lanes, etc. Some of the trails extend into Illinois and you can almost ride to Milwaukee on a bike only path (few short road sections). Lots of quiet back roads west and south of town if you’re into road cycling. If you live in town you can bike most of the year. 

Coolest Madison events: Saturday farmers market, concerts on the square, crazy legs run, evenings at the memorial Union terrace. 

Places to live: I’d say you can’t go too wrong somewhere on or near the Isthmus if you want a more urban lifestyle. 
- Near East side (Williamson street, Tenney-Lapham, Marquette neighborhood) is a bit like parts of Seattle. New apartment buildings along East Washington avenue. A lot of older stuff too that might be cheaper. 
- Monroe street and Vilas neighborhoods are very nice, and you’d be close to the arboretum. 

Lots of book shops here and fairly intellectual population.

Atwood - awesome area, but it's very small, and a bit ""too"" hip if you know what I mean, just gets a little small quick

Downtown - no thanks, not in college anymore and so overrun by UW students

Monona - nice location wise but a lot of settled down families, just kind of dark and desolate at night

Middleton/Waunakee - expensive, families, and settled down feel

Verona- gotten way expensive for what it offers, been there.

Fitchburg - seems okay? But a bit of no mans land if not settled but seems like a good mix of all.

Central - malls, congestion, high schools, just seems a bit not worth the price tag either

Cottage Grove/SP/Deforest - too far east

I stayed downtown, and had a car so I could drive around a number of the outer areas including Middleton and Monona.

Downtown had a lot of young people, but I didn't see many modern buildings and the shopping centers were all pretty small.

"Madison Icequake Investigation Hello Madison!  I've seen a few posts from local yokels about feeling icequakes over the past few days, and as a local seismologist, I was curious to see if I could find any data to substantiate these claims.

TLDR: Icequake confirmed!

This is going to get nerdy, so strap in and prepare to be underwhelmed.

You won't be surprised to learn that there aren't a ton of professional high-grade seismometers installed in Wisconsin and streaming real-time data.  However, there is a decent network of low-cost citizen science seismometers that we can use.  These devices are called [Raspberry Shakes](http://raspberryshake.org) and you can buy one yourself for a couple hundred bucks and stream live data to their site, which is where I went looking for data.  Wouldn't you know, in a city as nerdy as Madison, there were a handful of Raspberry Shakes with data to look at.

[Map from Raspberry Shake Data Viewer](https://preview.redd.it/nojc1icrcree1.png?width=1732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c3d997d02624f04d9c37fc32670f33c140d256)

The map from the Raspberry Shake dataviewer shows where these shakes are installed, and since the reddit posts about the icequake yesterday (1/22/25) seemed to center on the eastside, I focused on the 3 stations that are unhelpfully labeled with the station type (and not the unique station name) which surround lake Monona.  \[3D red, 1D green, 1D yellow\].  Since the 3D red station close to downtown is closest to the lake, let's take a look at data from that station first.  It's actual name is R5C2A.

[Helicorder view of data from R5C2A for 1\/22\/25 CST](https://preview.redd.it/rib85tiqdree1.png?width=1898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8e388f3fa5935ae5fdce29fa9114e586418fc7c)

Here's a plot of filtered waveform data from R5C2A from yesterday.  These plots are a little hard to read, but the basic idea is that each row is 30 minutes of waveform data and the local time is shown on the right.  Yesterday's post about OMG ICEQUAKE! appeared around 10:21am, so if you look at the white line in the middle of the plot that starts just after 10am local (on the left it starts right next to 16:00 UTC) and follow that link to about the 20 minute mark, sure enough there's a little wiggle!  Let's zoom in for a closer look...

[Waveform and helicorder data from station R5C2A in downtown Madison](https://preview.redd.it/u3b7wtzaeree1.png?width=1872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1477f47849c79b2a596f3599da3df83cced9803d)

Here you can see a zoomed in view of about 90 seconds of waveform data from R5C2A that encompasses that wiggle which was recorded around 10:20am yesterday.  The helicorder view in the lower half of the figure is the same one from the previous image above with the section we're zoomed into highlighted.  Okay great, we found a wiggle at the suspected time...but how do we know if this is a real signal?  Well one good way would be to see if we can find this same wiggle on some of the other nearby stations.  Let's take a look...

[Waveform and helicorder data from station RD6A1 near the beltline](https://preview.redd.it/zoo3aq8veree1.png?width=1894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caf2c00fc2e8850af5665465b19cfcb556b31d21)

Here's a similar plot from station RD6A1 which on our map is the one near the beltline on the southeast side of Lake Monona and if we zoom into the same time you can see that this station also sees the signal at about the same time (\~10:20:50).  So this signal is pretty likely real!  Just to confirm, let's take a look at one addition station (R3118) which is NNE of the lake on our map.

[Waveform and helicorder data from R3118 in NE Madison](https://preview.redd.it/fzr25jxofree1.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=782558e6bc07232395111200a16c506133a75f35)

Same signal, same arrival time.  Okay, I think we can call this case closed.  If this were a geophysics course, now would be the time where you'd be asked to measure the arrival time of the signal at each of the three stations very precisely and then work out the location of the epicenter based on the speed of the seismic waves and the locations of the stations.  I'm not going to do that here, but what I will show you are some pretty plots that let us peek into the frequency content of the waveforms for some additional confirmation that these signals are coming from a real source.

[Waveform and spectrogram from station R5C2A](https://preview.redd.it/k65i4q2mgree1.png?width=2106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21252cc4d4d88f9344c09ca8c367727155f6daf2)

This plot from our downtown station shows the same filtered waveform at the top and below it's plotting a spectrogram over the same time period.  The brighter the colors in the spectrogram show where there's more energy at that particular time and frequency.  Show for this signal, we can clearly see that at the time corresponding to the waveform arrival there's a bright spot in the spectrogram around \~10Hz.  Can we see this same feature on our other stations?

[Waveform and spectrogram plot from station RD6A1 near beltline](https://preview.redd.it/bq0v8ml1hree1.png?width=2108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d24e7d6886f6438ac6cb7a529b8b3f6221b8f47b)

[Waveform and spectrogram plot from station R3118 in NE Madison](https://preview.redd.it/6kduxmq3hree1.png?width=2112&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca96b70a998e34d4f114fd8c03ec925389763d7a)

Yes we can!  Lower frequency seismic signals are detectable at farther distances than higher frequency signals, so it makes sense that if these 3 stations are all detecting the same somewhat-distant signal, that it would be showing up as a lower frequency signal, and indeed it is.

I'm not a glaciologist, but I would bet that icequakes like this aren't all that uncommon near large freshwater lakes that experience extreme cold like we've been having lately.  I have no idea if we can expect more (probably?) but it's comforting for me as a nerdy seismologist to know that I can actually use all the stuff I learned in grad school to ground truth some of the claims I come across on reddit.",reddit,downtown

"Apartments in Madison I’m a medical resident moving to madison from St. Louis and am having trouble finding an apartment. Im have somewhat specific things I am looking for and I’m just having a hard time as I’ve never been to Madison. I know this is picky - but I want somewhere with character. I’m HATE the modern high-rise Apartments. Something about the grey/modern looking high rise feels cold. Where I live now has character, think hardwood floors, smaller apartment building, lots of windows, etc… I live in a suburb of St. Louis (Clayton - if you know the area), about 10 minutes away from downtown. It’s a nice upscale area, with older homes that have character - it’s an old money suburb. I like it because I can go on walks outside, enjoy the architecture of the older homes, and I’m close enough to downtown than an Uber is cheap when I want to go out-out. Also, hoping not to be in a building with a bunch of college students. I’d love to be in a place with a lot of young professionals. What areas in madison come to mine?

There’s a LOT of new “big house” construction on the edges of town and in the suburbs (near the American Center on the far East side, Sun Prairie, DeForest, Waunakee), so I’d expect to find more 4+ bedroom properties by widening your search radius another 10-20 miles.",reddit,downtown

"I'm gonna give this a shot. - Room to rent-ish needed. I've been seeing posts from people looking for housing for a while now,  and seeing people's active responses to these posts, it suddenly dawned on me that maybe I should actually put myself out there and make an ACTUAL post inquiring after my need. People here keep suprising me with their kindness to others compared to what I've experienced in other cities, and you all are restoring my faith humanity. While I try to come off as being of the same socioeconomic status that I've always been up until a year ago,  I also haven't made it a super secret that I had a series of devastating events happen to me a year ago, which led to my boyfriend and I living in his car the last few months.  I am at wits end so often about our situation. It's so challenging to live any form of normal life like this,  and it's a barrier to ever getting back out of it just by hard work and best efforts. I don't need to go into all the reasons that we can't ""just do"" the things that we need to get ahead, how many limitations and set backs there are in terms of daily basic activities that we deal with on a daily basis - things that are not present when you have a home base to live. We need to find any sort of living arrangement that would allow us to have our own room somewhere for at least 2 months. We were blessed right before Christmas to be given a room to stay in for a month, and we made some progress towards bettering our life, but it was too short. After what I've went through, healing from trauma has been a non-optional thing I had to do/still doing, and it took almost 2 weeks for me to stop having moments of random aniexty/panic and feel safe enough in my environment before I started being able to get started on (&amp; make progress!) on my own things instead of just cleaning the house. (My boyfriend and I both default towards trying to make our hosts houses real clean for them and doing all the dishes, yardwork, chores as the only way we know how to show our appreciation. Also, stress cleaning is a thing.) We need someone who has an extra room and willing to work something out with us where we could rent anything according to a mutually beneficial agreement. Both my boyfriend and I are bad at picking up the subtext in social arrangements, and ideally need someone who doesn't think it's weird to have sit down and write up (even if it's just me asking questions and writing down the answers) the specific terms, requirements, and expectations of the place we would be staying. Every time I've had stayed anywhere that belong to someone else I always seem to get it wrong. Because I want to get it right and I don't want to offend anyone or appear ungrateful, I ask  questions about things I should or shouldn't do, how things are typically done at the place, or what the host would like me to do to help out. In response, I have gotten a lot a feedback basically saying not to worry about this, or make yourself at home, or I can tell they think me asking is weird or annoying. For example there always comes a point where I'm told they thought I was going to X or Y, but when X or Y was addressed previously I was told X or Y was taken care of, not to worry about X or Y, etc. In addition to finding someone who doesn't find it uncomfortable to have me ask for some answers to questions I may have about living in someone else's place up front, I need to find someone who is willing to let us semi-privately and quietly coexist alongside of them if they also live there, and has the means and kindness to let us ease into the amount of total rent we pay for the space. What I mean by the former is that I have a hard time correctly if and when someone wants me to be social and acknowledge their presence with small talk and when I can just do my own thing or stay in my bedroom for as long as I like. (I got criticized at the last place for being in our bedroom and not acknowledging when they came home,  but was also told that another person there said I follow them around - which was me just trying to acknowledge them so they didn't get mad that I was ignoring them.) What I meant by the latter, easing into payment rate, is that I acknowledge that people are renting rooms for 5 to 8 hundred dollars a month. Living in your car, especially in winter trying to stay warm, most of the money we make ends up going to food and gas, and we just don't have
hardly anything right now up front. We also are tragically behind on things such as payments on our storage units, my car needs to be registered because I couldn't afford to do that.When it expired at the end of last month, my car won't even start without being jumped. So eventually, a new battery needs to be purchased if i'm going to do anything with it, and it needs a new windshield because it's cracked really bad (it's crazy bad). Those are just the big things. At this point I could solidly say we could afford 200 a month,  maybe 300, but until i can start living somewhat of a normal lifestyle again, i cannot say that any more than that is in our budget. I just need to know that I have a place I can stay long enough to get a better paying source of income. I will skip the paragraph explaining some of the ways that living in your car prevents getting a source of reliable income for now, but it most definitely does! My situation, it's so hard on me because I came to this town because this is where the science jobs are, and I have a bachelor's degree in biology with a minor in microbiology and geography. I wanna work at the university or some place where I make a lot of money, but I can't get to that point in the situation I'm in. It is really taking a toll on my mental health and our relationship, so I don't know if there's anyone who has anything at all available and is willing to work out some sort of rental situation in which we pay what we can for a couple of weeks, then according to whatever schedule we lay out increase the amount we pay little-by-little so that I can make a life again. My ultimate goal is to rent a place of our own for the 2 of us. Hopefully one with an extra room so that my son can live with as well if he decides he wants to. I really miss him, but a car is no place for a fifteen year old boy, so he's with his father an hour away, and I haven't seen him since August (not by choice).",reddit,campus

"What's up with some of these entitled acting panhandlers in this city?  In the past couple of years, I've had several panhandlers get demanding with me.  I'm generally friendly and will engage most people or at least show them some respect/human dignity, but damn some of the needy folks in this city are way over the top.  

Last summer I was taking my family out to dinner for someone's birthday.  I had some cash in my pocket and was approached by an older couple, one of whom was using a walker.  They asked me if I had any change and I gave them a twenty, being in a good mood and feeling like helping them out.  I handed the twenty to the woman with the walker and as soon as I let go, the guy said, ""Open that wallet and fish out a twenty for me to!""  I told them to split it and walked away.  That guy spat on the ground and said some insults under his breath.  

A few months later walking to work, some young guy starts staring at me and makes a b-line for me crossing a busy street diagonally.  He marches right up to me in a very aggressive manner and says, ""Give me a cigarette!"" No please, no nothing, just a very aggressive demand.   I shook my head and kept moving.  

Today, after two long weeks of almost constant work I finish up an early shift and am looking forward to stopping at the Willy Street Coop to grab one of those breakfast burritos.  It's been years since I've had one and thought it would be a nice little treat for myself.   It's early and  I can see the parking lot is already full, so I park on the street.  As I approach the store I notice a guy sitting down next to the bike lock station, he says, ""Get me something warm to eat when you go in there!""  I literally pondered being a giving human being, but damn I do not do well with demands.  I was thinking, the Luke House is literally a block or two away, why is this guy looking for food from Willy Street members.  If I remember correctly, we chip to help the community.  

I'm thinking about this shit and notice the burritos have gotten a lot smaller since I last purchased them a while ago.  I told this to the check out person, saying, ""I guess the coop isn't immune to shrink inflation."" She didn't seem amused so I told her to have a nice day, and moved on.  

Now I'm heading back outside to my car.  Dude who is still sitting down says, ""What did you end up getting me?"" 

I said, ""Nothing sorry.""  But then I thought why the fuck am I apologizing?  I don't know this guy's story why he's panhandling outside the coop or wherever, nor do I really care.  Every fucking day, every hour I work in public service and always treat people with respect whether they deserve it or not knowing it's not for me to judge.   Easily one in twenty people throughout my day show any respect or appreciation of even acknowledge me as a human being unless they want something from me.     

I really don't want to be the grumpy public servant, but some days I just let that shit get to me.",reddit,willy street
"Dec 19 plow update 
View this email in your browser
City of Madison
Cars driving on a snowy road.
December 19 - All Streets Will Be Plowed
All City of Madison streets will be plowed. The citywide plowing operation will begin at midnight. There will not be a snow emergency in effect.  You can help the plowing operation by following all appropriate parking rules. Also, if you have a Friday trash &amp; recycling collection, do not put your carts in the street for pickup.

Here’s what you should expect from our operations over the next several hours in response to this storm:

Operations From 3:00pm Until Midnight
Streets Division crews will remain on the salt routes plowing and applying salt as needed.

Travel through the city will be slow and slippery as the snow continues to fall.  Expect to encounter snow covered roads, especially in areas that are not part of the salt route network.

Be slow, patient, and safe and generally make good choice while you make your way through the city.

Operations Starting at Midnight; Expect Plowing to be Ongoing During the Friday Morning Commute
Streets Division staff, along with heavy equipment contractors, and crews from other City of Madison Public Works agencies, such as the Parks Construction section and Engineering Division will begin the citywide plowing operation.  The combined plowing force will be around 150 pieces of equipment.

When citywide plowing gets underway, the city is divided into about 60 different sections. Each section is assigned equipment. Crews are all dispatched to begin plowing at roughly the same time.  No one area is assigned to be first or last.

Citywide plowing takes around 12 to 14 hours for this initial pass to be completed.

We anticipate that this citywide plowing operation will not be completed until the early afternoon on Friday, December 20.

About Your Friday Morning Commute
Since the plowing will get underway at midnight, you may see our crews plowing your neighborhood while you are heading out the door for your Friday morning commute.

The roads are likely to still be snowy and slippery.  You must remain slow and patient on the roads.  Give yourself extra time for your Friday morning travels to be sure you arrive at your destinations on time.

Also, as plows circle through streets, snow falls off the plow blades, creating short little walls of snow across intersections called windrows.  This is normal, and it is a temporary problem. As plows work through neighborhood streets these blockages at intersections are pushed back to the curb along with all of the other snow from the road.  But you may encounter this problem on your morning commute. 

We are also plowing the city curb-to-curb.  You may need to shovel out the end of your driveway in the morning.  This particular snow is fairly dry, so while it is always an unpleasant task, it should not be as terrible as the heavy dense snows we sometimes get.

And finally, a reminder: plows do not peel up the final layer of snow from roads.  It is normal for there to be a compacted layer of snow left behind on residential streets after they are plowed.  The main reason why salt routes (or main thoroughfares) are usually bare pavement in the hours following storms is salt usage.

How You Can Help with the Citywide Plowing Operation
First, if you are traveling be safe on the roads.  They will be snow covered and slippery.  And if you encounter a plow truck on the road, please keep a safe distance.  Do not tailgate them.  Do not cut them off.  They are out working to make the roads safe for everyone.

Please choose off-street parking options for your cars, trailers, and so on.

If an off-street option is not available, please follow all appropriate parking regulations where you park, including alternate side parking where appropriate.

If Friday is your trash and/or recycling pickup day, do not put your carts in the street gutter for collection.  Carts in the road are just one more obstruction for plow drivers. 

What’s Next?
Streets Division staff will continue to monitor the roads and the weather.  Operations will adjust accordingly.

We will provide an update on our operations on Friday, December 20.

"2/12: Snow Emergency Declared 
All City of Madison streets will be plowed starting at midnight.  A snow emergency has been declared.  Alternate side parking will be effect for the entire City of Madison tonight.

Citywide plowing takes 12 to 14 hours to complete.

Travel will be snowy and difficult, especially in the afternoon and early evening as the storm is expected to increase in intensity.  Be ready for snowy, and slippery roads.  Your Thursday morning commute may be impacted as well as the citywide plowing work may still be ongoing.

There is a lot of information to cover.  Use the headers below to help understand the different phases of our response.

What We Did This Morning
The Streets Division’s response to the storm began at 7:30am when the flakes began to fall.  Plow trucks were out to plow and salt the main thoroughfares as needed.  Additional trucks were also dispatched with sand for non-salt route areas that may become slippery.  They were primarily working with our trash and recycling collection crews to ensure these pickups happened without interruption.

For This Afternoon and into the Evening
From 3:00pm to midnight, crews will continue working on the salt routes.  Crews will be plowing and applying salt as needed to the 782 miles of traffic lanes that make up the main thoroughfares.

When applying salt, the threshold where it is effective is around 20 degrees.  While air temperatures are below that line, pavement temperatures are expected to be at or slightly above 20 degrees according to our sensors.  With conditions being on this borderline of salt’s effectiveness, it will be slower to work, but it will still work.

During the late afternoon into the typical evening rush hour time, snow is expected to intensify. Travel will get worse.

With all of these conditions coalescing, be ready for a slow, snowy, and slippery commute.  Remember to make good choices while out in this challenging weather. Be slow. Be alert. Be patient.  Allow for additional travel time to arrive at your destinations on time.

A plow truck takes at least three hours to complete a lap through their assigned salt route.  The plows get slower when traffic and conditions get worse; our trucks get hung up in the same city congestion as everyone else. When storms are active (and long lasting), roads will get snowy and slick because as plows loop through their routes, the fresh snow covers over their work, and it just takes time until the plow can come back to address any newly fallen snow.

Citywide Plowing Starts at Midnight; If You Must Park on the Street, Follow Alternate Side Parking Rules Tonight
The storm is expected to wane around midnight.  We will begin our plowing operation at that time.

Approximately 150 pieces of equipment will be out plowing every City of Madison street.  Crews will be from the Streets Division, the Urban Forestry section of Streets, and partner City Public Works agencies, like the Parks and Engineering Divisions.  Also, we receive critical assistance from heavy equipment contractors who help plow many residential areas, too.

Since a snow emergency is in effect, everyone who parks on the road must follow alternate side parking rules from 1am to 7am, including people who park within the Snow Emergency Zone.  If possible, please choose off-street parking options instead. Additional details about alternate side parking rules can be found on the City of Madison winter website.

Do not put your trash and recycling carts in the street for your Thursday pickup.  Carts in the road are another obstacle for plows, just like a parked car.

Remember, snow emergencies are two-night events so plows can clear both sides of the road.

When plowing a street curb-to-curb, you will get snow at the end of your driveway.  Plow drivers are not doing this on purpose.  It’s just the physics of snowplowing.  Plows work by pushing snow from the road to the side of the street.  They ride as close as possible to the curb to keep snow as wide as possible to keep them open and safe for travel.  As they drive forward snow builds up on the plow because the curb traps it there. Each time they pass a space where the curb disappears, snow falls into that gap. Driveway aprons, crosswalk ramps, and other spaces like this all receive snow falling from the plow.  It’s understandable why it’s frustrating.  No one enjoys this.   However, to plow the streets as quickly as we do with the equipment we have, snow in the driveway is unavoidable.

When will your street be plowed and more information
The citywide plowing will begin at midnight.  It takes 12 to 14 hours for every street to be plowed.  Your street may not be plowed until sometime close to noon on Thursday.

Why does it take that long? Madison has over 1,800 miles of traffic lanes to plow. That’s like driving from here to the Mojave Desert in California.  It just takes a lot of time to cover that much distance even with 150 trucks.  Crews will be working quickly and safely – but it still takes several hours.

No one is assigned to be first or last when the City is plowed.  The City is divided into over 60 sub-areas, and each area is assigned equipment. The plowing all starts at the same time.

Streets Division staff will be monitoring the roads and the weather.  Our operations will adjust as weather conditions require it.

And, finally if you have not already done so, remember to vote in the snowplow name election that is currently open on the Wisconsin Salt Wise page.

"Madison's connection to the Laurie Dann case. This past week I had several (often tearful) conversations about the tragedy at Abundant Life and how unexpected it was that it happened here. I was also reminded that Madison has a history with mass shootings that can be forgotten. One of these is the case of Laurie Dann which is viewed as one of the first widely publicized school shootings. While Laurie's time in Madison was brief, it is remarkable in respect to the many cracks she fell through here, especially in the months leading up to the shootings. 

Laurie Dann grew up in the Chicago area's North Shore and had taken classes at the UW in the late 1970s  before moving on to other schools, getting married, divorced; returning to Madison in 1987. Along the way there were numerous signs of mental illness and brushes with the law which included violent behavior, theft and death threats. While here she exhibited bizarre behavior and was arrested several times by MPD for theft, vandalism, and accused of stealing arsenic and lead from one of the UW labs. Much of this was done while under the care of a UW psychiatrist who felt she was not a threat. 

She left Madison on May 16 1988 to go back to live with her parents. 4 days later she went around dropping off food she had poisoned with what she had stolen from the UW and kidnapped a couple kids she had babysat. She took them with her to a Highland Park elementary school where she started a fire and then returned them home and tried to burn their house down (thankfully the family got out). She then went to the Hubbard's Woods school in Winnetka where she began a mass shooting, killing an 8 year-old boy and injuring 5 others. After that she ran to a nearby home and shot a young man before killing herself. 

The Laurie Dann case counters a number of misconceptions. 
1. Only males commit mass shootings. 
2. Columbine was the 1st. Laurie Dann did hers over a decade prior to Columbine. 
3. Mass shootings are done with assault rifles. Laurie Dann used 3 legally purchased hand guns. 
4. Just having someone under psychiatric care will always prevent these tragedies from occurring. 

The recent tragedy and what happened at Paradigm 6 years ago should be lessons not to assume these things can't occur here. We need to always be vigilent to get help for those in need to protect ourselves and our families.",reddit,general madison

"Dear guy who mocked my Chipotle order in front of your kids Dear Madison,

Let's not comment on what you think other people are going to order behind you. I went to Chipotle tonight after work and was standing behind a family in line. The dad was taking his kids through the line, but then it came to his turn to order his own food. He tells the guy he wants double meat and then says, ""Do I look like a single meat type of guy? I bet that guy (talking about me and pointing) needs like a triple meat."" The ironic part? I was actually there to order double meat myself - not because I'm some food-obsessed person like he seemed to assume, but because I'm carefully tracking my protein macros as part of my fitness journey. But thanks for judging away, random guy.

First of all, never comment on what someone should or shouldn't eat. Eating disorders are a real thing, and while I am overweight, I am actively working on changing that. I'm down almost 30 pounds already.

Second, it is never appropriate to make a joke about someone's weight, no matter how well you know them. (This guy was a stranger.) Pointing at strangers in public is incredibly rude and can make people feel uncomfortable and targeted. This behavior is especially concerning when you're with your children, as it sets a poor example for them about how to treat others.

Making loud comments about other customers not only makes them uncomfortable but also puts the service workers in an awkward position. Someone's appearance tells you nothing about their personal journey, health status, or eating habits. These kinds of public comments can really impact someone's day or even trigger deeper issues with self-image and anxiety about eating in public.

I hope you can understand why this experience was particularly hurtful and use it as a learning opportunity. We all have the power to make public spaces feel safer and more welcoming for everyone. The next time you see someone ordering something specific, remember that you have no idea about their personal health journey, dietary needs, or fitness goals - and more importantly, it's none of your business.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",reddit,general madison
"Madison Housing Supply Misconception seakc87 recently posted this overplayed misconception: “People are being displaced with every building that gets torn down to build another”.

Hmmmm, let’s look at some recent examples-

1. The Standard- 1st Street and East, Washington, formally housing bedraggled offices of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Monkey Bar gym (that was moving anyway), a dollar store of some kind, and who the hell cares what else. A crappy little strip of nothing that now has 275 units. No one displaced.

2. The old CUNA building on Sherman Avenue- basically a vacant office building  that will be turned into 300+ housing units, that displaced… Wait for it… No one.

3. SWIB, on the 100 block of E. Wilson St. Formerly housed some overpaid remote working State of Wisconsin investment Board hedge funders, and which site will now have… Yep, you guessed it, 300+ housing units. Displaced how many? … Wait for it once again… no one.

4. Union Corners, a few years ago and going on into today, formerly a blighted strip of land on 11 acres, 250+ units including multi-generational housing and a UW Clinic… Displaced how many?… You’re getting the drift.

5. Madison Yards, where the new Whole Foods is. Currently only 300 units in the one tower, but 300 more planned for the site adjacent. Residents displaced? Zero.

6. Judge Doyle Square, 150 new units. And likely 200 more coming plus a hotel opening soon. Zero residents displaced.

7. All of university Avenue from UW to Middleton. All of the new projects around UW hospital, Shorewood Boulevard, Hilldale, farther out towards Allen… I’m not sure there were any people actually displaced. And if so, it was a handful, relative to thousand+ new units.

8. The 250+ units on Fair Oaks and E Washington, affordable, replacing a defunct and vacant bakery (last owned by a foreign conglomerate)

9. The new project proposed for the corner of Blair and Wilson will displace a handful of residential units with several hundred new housing units.

10. The new mass timber building, going up on the old bakery site on Paterson and East Washington, another nearly 300 units displacing… Do you really have to wait for it again… No one

Should we go back in the time machine, and look at the 700-1000 blocks of E. Washington Ave., formerly a giant used car dealership and a brownfield. Now housing about 1000 units. Who was displaced? No one. The Lower State Street, Gorham, Johnson, Bassett, Broom juggernaut of a few dozen 3-flats ( and yes, one small apartment building) replaced with thousands of housing units. Thousands….

And in smaller neighborhoods?

On Williamson Street, where are the new apartment buildings? The old vacant office building at 821… no one displaced. The Struck and Irwin fence supply company across the street soon to be 175 units- people displaced ? Zero. The old Stop N Go on Winnebago, soon to be 60 something units, the only person displaced was the post office clerk and the gas station attendants. None of whom lived there. People displaced, zero. The 500 or so units around Schenk’s Corners might have torn down a handful of 3-flats… 

What about over on Monroe Street? The  building with 80 units of housing at the corner of Spooner and Monroe, was a bank site. Residents displaced, zero. The new building over Lucky’s bar on Regent Street, zero displaced. The new apartment building going up on Park Street and Regent. Well, you might miss Fraboni‘s deli, but there was less than a dozen units displaced for several hundred created. 

The affordable 200+ unit apartment project on S. Park St., by the old Pick ‘n, Save, another piece of vacant land displacing no one.

The apartment building going up on cottage Grove Road and Monona Boulevard that didn’t actually displace the Jade Monkey since it just moved a block down, but residents displaced? Zero. 

The Voit farm on Milwaukee Street that is slated for a massive new development of potentially up to 1000 housing units. Residents displaced? Zero.

There are, of course, a few rare examples of some old housing stock being torn down to be replaced by 10X density. Such is life, but rare due to the cost of acquisition and developing those sites. These tend to be in extremely highly desirable areas with extremely old and dilapidated single-family or 2-3 flat properties that have reached the end of their usable/rentable lives. Such as recent projects on E. Johnson St., the couple of projects on W. Washington Ave. In the 4-500 block, W Main St, the Continental, etc. But they are a few and far between.

What seakc87 is really arguing against is a market economy. Take housing specifically. If there weren’t people willing to pay what the market brings, either vacancies would go up or rents would go down, or both. And the market would adjust. Why does no one on these threads ever acknowledge that we have such a low vacancy rate because there are apparently plenty of people (who, last time I checked, still qualify as human beings whose lives matter as much as anyone else) willing to pay the rents that are available? That’s how the market economy works. There’s a high demand for higher rent apartments by higher earning people. And so the market responds.

What you’re seeing is the market economy working. Does it work for everyone? Depends on how you define that. Does it mean everyone can live in a $800-900 a month one bedroom apartment? No. Either figure out a way to make more money or move farther out, or somewhere else entirely. Supply and demand works. It just doesn’t work equally for everyone. That’s the reality. 

But hey, if you think that government  control of income, rents, food prices, and the rest is a good idea, there are a number of places out there that are trying it. China, Russia, North Korea, or closer to home, Venezuela, Cuba... Take your pick.

Encouraging and even incentivizing new market rate housing does not mean it has to be at the expense of creating new affordable housing. They’re just entirely different things. 

More market rate housing units will not necessarily equate to lower overall rents, but in general it will limit the rate of increase of rents, and at a certain point will find equilibrium. Preventing supply from meeting demand will absolutely result in a higher rate of rent increases. That’s just a fact. So, to repeat, limiting new market rate housing will ensure that rents go up faster. Increasing the supply of market rate housing will minimize the rate of increase.",reddit,downtown
"Walgreens Is ASS Bear with me, I have had a rough weekend and have a lot to say.  I will try and be short...

I have serious health problems.  And have had for years.  And as such, I need pharmacy grade medications on a pretty consistent basis.   I understand being a pharmacist is stressful and involves putting up with rude, stupid and/or aggressive people.  

But Walgreens has far and away THE worst pharmacists on the planet, or at least as far as I can tell.   I once had to fill a 10 day supply of percocet.   They only had a day and a half supply in stock, so they gave that to me and told me to fill the rest when the shipment comes in two days later.  Went back two days later, only to be told I needed a new script.  OK, did that and after playing phone tag with my Dr and nurse, went back in to fill the new script​.  They told me that I had already filled that script and it was against the law to fill it ""again.""  Same fucking pharmacy, same fucking pharmacIST.   They told me I needed to get my doctor to call the pharmacy to confirm nothing shady was going on.  Fucking ridiculous, but while in a lot of pain, went and worked with my clinic again to get my doctor to call.  After my doctor called, I went to finally get that script filled.  But nope!  Same pharmacist who i had been dealing with all along, told me it was illegal to fill it even though she had talked to my doctor.  I eventually got it sent to another pharmacy but was never able to fill the last 8 and a half day supply because that walgreens pharmacist had marked my photo id flagged as an ""narcotic abuser.""  The entire time, as far as I could tell, I was as polite as could be.  But that pharmacist wouldn't make eye contact, was virulently rude and treated me like a bum begging for a hit of heroin.  All over a total of 40mg of oxycodone.

That is just one example, but no matter which Walgreens I go to, and what medications I fill, I get treated like I'm nothing more than an inconvenience.   I understand filling narcotics has more red tape, bureaucratic ""guardrails"" but nausea meds, gabapentin, digestive enzymes...always a hassle.  Now when I go to fill promethazine, something usually filled in a matter of a half hour max, they have it sent in from a factory in Chicago!  A three to four day wait for something I usually have an urgent need for because, ya know, puking isn't fun.  And there's ALWAYS a wait.  I went to pick up a script tonight that was waiting for me, and I was in that store for an hour and 15 minutes.

It's been this way for years, though I will admit it's gotten worse in the last year or so.  But when my doctor tries sending scripts to another pharmacy, they don't have it in stock or they need to order it.  Most of my meds aren't things I can wait days for.  So now I'm having to use the outpatient pharmacy at UW Hospital.   But I live in Middleton and not only is it over an hour of driving both ways, but I also have to park in the garage and walk 10 minutes.  The pharmacists there, though, are extremely friendly and efficient.  Sometimes I even feel like they think I'm a real human being who deserves respect.  Shocking, I know.

Where can I go other than Walgreens?  Any suggestions?  And why is Walgreens so horrifically abusive to their patients?  Even if they're understaffed, that doesn't give them license to be assholes.  I appreciate any advice.  And apologies for writing a novel.  

P.S.  If you're reading this and you're the blond haired Walgreens pharmacist on Mineral Point who work​s the overnight shift?  You, sir, are awesome.  It's too bad I have only ever had the pleasure of your services twice.  The rest of you suck.  I have no idea how such a shoddy run company is seemingly the only game in town.

"The scheudling issue is a symptom of a much larger issue that occurs frequently with US systems.  A lack of data and then the argument that its just much too hard.  Any why people in the US get mad at our government programs - 'its too hard' . No its really not.

Your statement is exactly correct, making sure the bus is never later would mean making sure the bus is almost always waiting extra time.  Yes, that is how its done.  Its how Germany does it for their trains (they build in slightly longer stops every 4-5 stations to ensure that they don't have cascading reliability issues.  Airlines pay pilots for only the time the plane is traveling so its schedule (or actual time) - whichever is greater.  Computers track those times and they regularly are tweaking those times by even just a few minutes many, many times per year because time is money/efficiency.

Before transfer points - the complaint of Madison Metro was that everything went downtown first to a central location (capital square/state street) and then you had to transfer to another bus even if your bus was in the same region (east side to east side).  It operated like a hub and spoke airplane model.  The original idea was that by having the outer transit hubs you would take a bus to the closest hub (all buses would meet there) and then you would transfer to the other hub and then maybe you would transit at that hub to a bus to get you to a final destination.  While logical and what businesses do for freight - people don't like transfers (they fear that they will miss connections) and therefore this service was ended fairly quickly and it was more like the old but with transit connections.  

The reality is that managers of Madison Metro have never invested in their drivers. They finally invested in another bus garage but they fact of the matter is - bus drivers should not have be stopping and using public restrooms, etc for breaks for food, bathroom usage, etc.

The new bus tracking system - should take less than a month. Every private fleet of vehicles will have GPS installed in days, so assume a month. On most vehicles it takes 1-2 hours/car.  You can then start to get data and reliably track the OTP performance, you can share it with customers and ask them to help.  Hell, it was what Andy Byford did in NYC and was seeing results until the governor fired him as he was fixing shit.

"I think you are oversimplifing things and missing some of the potential issues. 

The point I am trying to make is that cyclist want the their bicycles to be ""vehicles"" when it conveniences them

Part of the problem is that mindset, cyclist do not actually what the be ""vehicles"" at all, what they want is the freedom to travel and to be able to use publicly infrastructure to get from point a to point b. 

Fundamental a bicycle is not the same as most vehicles on the road, but laws tend to group them in either of the two categories ""vehicle"" or ""pedestrian"", usually depending on what infrastructure they are riding upon. But, there are many things that would normally apply to ""vehicle"" that shouldn't apply to bicycles. Like the obvious, bicycle shouldn't ride on a freeway, or hang out in the left lane on a multi laned road (except to turn left). But they should be allowed to use bike lanes, shoulders, and sidewalks.

Less obvious things are how cyclist should treat stop signs, as it is actually safer for a cyclist to treat a stop sign as a yield. (Yes this on is not legal everywhere yet, but does have federal support pushing for more states to change their laws)

https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2022-03/Bicyclist-Yield-As-Stop-Fact-Sheet-032422-v3-tag.pdf

&gt;But, when it comes to the nitty-gritty of taxes, fees, insurance, registration, and all of the responsibilities that vehicle owners have, they clutch their pearls claiming it's unfair.

The nitty-gritty part of it often causes more problems then it solves.(more on this later)

&gt;Cyclists want all of the benefits of a vehicle but do not want any of the shared responsibilities of having it - literally, the very definition of entitlemen

Again, cyclist want the benefit of geting from point a to point b.

&gt;Cyclists should have to pay proportional to the upkeep and maintenance of the roads that they use just like any other vehicle from a motor boat to a moped; the fact that this is controversial or seen as ""unfair"" is beyond me.

What proportion do you think would be fair? Consider how many miles and how much space a cyclist needs.

Now consider where funding goes, cyclist shouldn't need to pay for freeways, as they generally never use them. You'll mostly find the majority of cyclist in the city, which makes more since that generally taxation within cities ofthen have larger contribution to the roadways.

But lets go back to the other problems. 

Historical, taxation and registration tends to fail, mostly because the administration costs tend to cause those programs to lose money. There are not enough cyclist and the fair fee is to low.

Then there are other issues like how you tax and register children.

And how do you enforce it, while a vehicle registration has a plate that is associated with a particular make model color of a vehicle, the same system would not work well for a bicycle. 

Places that do enforce tax and regulations usually do so as a means of a one time fee, and mostly for the purposes of ""theft recovery"". With the exception of North Korea, which has a ""successfully"" system in place.

As far as a fee for maintenance, I would certainly support that if they can keep bike paths / gutters free if debris.

&gt;insurance

Interestingly most cyclist do have liability insurance, as the risk of liability is so low for cyclist, this is usually passed down from their own vehicle, home, or rental insurance. And while you can get dedicated insurance as a cyclist, you usually cannot get it as a stand alone liability insurance, as it simply isn't cost effective. And again, you'll run into the problem where administration cost far out weight the benifits. Thus the dedicated insurance usually always forces you to get theft insurance as well, as that's where most of the costs benefit is for a bicycle owner.

 There's also hidden costs as well.

Creating upfront barriers that prevent people from pursuing healthier activities and alternative modes of transportation, can have lasting effects like have more unhealthy community members and hight medical costs.

"I have limited interaction with the County and I believe Parisi in the belief that its a complex job/role  due to having to manage many relationships with the various cities, state and university officials they have to deal with.  That said - nothing tells me that Parisi actively made those things better.

Like many of you - I have limited interaction with the county but I do have interactions with a few things (Zoo, County Parks, and the Airport).  I don't directly interact with any of the inter-agency work so I won't speak to those.  


1.  Henry Vilas Zoo. the last 10 years is bumbling and mismanagement of the Dane County Henry Vilas Zoo.

The Zoo is unique in that the donation of the land was donated 100+ years ago with the stipulation that whatever the land is used for must be free and open to the public.  For decades the zoo was owned by the county and the day-to-day operations were run by the Henry Vilas Park Zoological Society.  They were forced out by Parisi and now run by the county. In the uproar - Parisi and the county smeared the volunteer (and I believe unpaid) heads of the organization - feeding articles to the Cap Times, WSJ and any media org that funds were missing.    
Within weeks - the clarification was done - there was no stealing but no public apologies to the friends of the Henry Vilas Park Zoological Society.  Furthermore, fundraising - a key thing has never recovered and is considerably less while expenses are much higher putting the Zoo in worse financial positions each year.  

Add in the fact that the Zoo Director, Ronda Schwetz is still the Zoo director after being charged with Sexual Harrassment and the zoo society and Dane county had to pay $2.8M in a settlement last year.  This is years after multiple people have complained against her.  (Our tax dollars funded $500k of this and the County commissioners have for 2 years demanded her firing and she is still there.  Disgusting.  

The Vilas Zoo barely passed accreditation in 2019 - and new accreditation is due this year.  For anyone who has been to the zoo the last few years and within the Zoo community there is serious concerns that they will lose accrediation this year.  They were close to losing it in 2019, exhibits have only gotten worse due to lower money (again management) and the fact that Schwetz is still there since that accrediation board (&amp; its insurance has to pay $2.3 of the $2.8M).

2.  Dane County Airport - 

First off the airport is very nice.  But its also very expensive.  The role of an airport, especially one such as Madison is provide flights for travellers and there is a direct correlation of more flights, etc leading to additional economic growth of a community.  The problem is - while its nice to have a nice airport - its better to have a cheap airport.  Cheap airports are more likely to get more flights as airlines can make more money and its kind of a cycle.  More flights = lower fees = more flights = even lower fees.  

Madison Airport leadership will talk about new markets - but the fact of the matter is - Madison has some of the highest ticket prices in the country as there are no low cost carriers here.  This is due to the fact that Madison Airport fees for Airlines are some of the highest in teh country.  (This has been the way for 20 years).  

3. Dane County parks are great. no complaints.

In a just world - Ronda Schwetz should have been fired multiple times. The fact that Joel Parisi has kept her around and risked the accreditiatoin of the zoo as well as it getting worse under her leadership - is to me reason that we need an outsider.  If Agard is Parisi's pick - I'll be picking the other candidate.",reddit,vilas
"Even though this post is a couple weeks old, I went to the new location for the first time on Sunday for my birthday and wanted to report back. The old Mint Mark location was my absolute favorite restaurant in Madison.  

The good:  

* The biscuit, as always, was incredible. As was the skillet cookie. Also loved the cauliflower and mafaldine pasta dish. I love that the menu is still so vegetable-forward. We only had one dish with meat in it and didn't feel like were missing out at all.  
* We got there at 5:15 on a Sunday, were told it'd be about 15 minutes so we got a drink at the bar, and were sat within 5 minutes.  
* Ambiance is nice, beautiful decor and furniture and lovely patio. The old location was certainly cozier but they did a nice job with the new space even though it feels a bit more corporate.  
* Service was good all around.  
* Superette is cool and I picked up a couple of fun salsas and some nice olive oil.  

The not so good:  

* I am SO sad they no longer have their unique, creative cocktails. This is probably a niche complaint because they still have a good selection with 3 choices for each type of spirit, but they are all classic cocktails. They don't have any of their own with fun syrups, infusions, juices, etc. Sooo disappointed about this because that was probably 30% of what we loved about MM. I'm hoping they bring these back when they open their cocktail bar next year.  
* We sat inside, and they had the large inside doors completely open to the outside patio, which was fine because it was a beautiful day, but the sun was shining intensely directly in my face/eyes for the first 20 or so minutes as it was setting which was really unpleasant.  
* A few of the dishes were underwhelming to me, which rarely happened at the old location. The sunchokes were bland, and the radiatore and bucatini were just okay and didn't totally work for me.  

The neutral:  

* People have commented on how entering through the parking garage is weird and that there's not enough bike parking, both of which I agree with. However, they recently posted on Instagram promoting the new BRT stop right in front of their building which I very much appreciate, and they also said you can now enter the restaurant through Superette which has an entrance on East Washington and is much more pedestrian friendly than having to go through the garage.  

So overall, I would say I enjoyed the experience but it wasn't up to par with what I had come to expect from the previous location. It's still one of the best restaurants in Madison and I'll continue to come back and hope they iron out the kinks. I also want to try their brunch and Friday martini lunch (and of course, the new cocktail bar once it opens).",reddit,east washington
"Recently moved to Monona so Stoughton Road has become a big part of my life over the last 2 years. 

People really need to understand that it's first and foremost a highway. You come in from the north or the south and you understand that, but people with a Madison-specific view will miss that part.

The frontage road situation around Pflaum and Buckeye needs to be addressed and improved. Dropping the speed limit to 35 or 45 seems like a terrible option because again, it's a major commercial highway. Overpasses, raised roads, tunnels, that's what I'm thinking.

"So the deal is that in Madison you cannot require a renewal decision before more than 1/4 of the lease has expired.  This was put in place because of competitive housing downtown meant that students were forced to decide almost upon move in prior to the ordinance.

As to why middle August (12th to the 18th) typically.  It has to do with the school year downtown and the cycle of students leaving town and moving back at end of summer.  

Because of the decades of incredibly low vacancy rates across the city. This has permeated across a large part of Madison essentially making most land lords fall in line to ensure max occupancy of their units.  As in 12 months every year and not miss out on a few months over the course of several years.  

As to why other landlords don’t know what they’ll have available until months after May or June.  They’re just buying time because they aren’t sure which tenants will actually end up renewing after their initial deadline.  That deadline is all they’re saying they can guarantee you they won’t offer it to others, but if it’s not gone you can still renew.  They also have tenants make moves between units or may plan to take some offline for renovations.  Basically it’s just a period where they figure their shit out of who is really leaving before guaranteeing anything to prospective tenants.  

Because in Madison they all expect to have 100% occupancy 100% of the time and anything less is failure.  Other markets landlords probably budget for say 10% vacancy, but with the housing market that hasn’t been reality for so long they likely expect and depend on never having to take that hit.",reddit,downtown

There is an emergency vet service called VCA that has multiple locations and reasonable prices. However, the mortality rate there is unacceptably high.

So, 10 years ago, you had to pay for a Match.com profile so you could actually meet people because nowadays 1/2 of the accounts are fake (because it’s free for the scammers).

So women I feel are scared to meet people that they meet online so it’s really hard to meet people. Only 12 people viewed my profile in a month supposedly and it’s like I have no control over that.

So here’s my idea: maybe some women would like to bring their friends and meet me so that they feel safer. I love art and comedy and do stand up.

"Did you see the woman in pink scrubs this morning? Did you see the woman in pink scrubs this morning?

Today (8/28) a woman was walking across traffic where she shouldn't have been. 

I was turning from High Point Rd onto Mineral Point Rd. There is construction, red paint, and now a woman. At first, I was annoyed that my green light was interrupted. Then I saw the car was stopped and thought maybe it broke down. Then I saw the man get out of the driver's side and follow her into the street. Cars were zipping around them. It was around 8:20am, rush hour. She was motioning for him to stay away, and I went to pull over. Then he punched her and started dragging her by the hair back to the car. She is struggling with him.

I called 911. By the time I was able to stop in a parking lot, I was ahead of them. He didn't have front plates on the car. The cars just kept going. Beeping at the inconvenience. When I pulled back on the street I was determined to get that license number. A few cars separated us, the next light was red. She opened the door and tried to get out again. He started driving as soon as it turned green. She was still partially out of the car and moved back in. 

Then he turned onto the ramp to get on the highway. I am right behind them this time, giving the license to the police. We are in the left lane about to get on the beltline. The door opens again and she is hanging out sideways trying to get away from him while the car is still moving. The cars keep driving around us, honking. I open my window and shout that she can get in my car. He stops the car and tries grabbing her again. She gets away and he follows her into the right lane of traffic. We are still on the ramp blocking traffic and cars are just zipping around us. 

Nobody else is stopping to help. 

I shout again she can come in my car. She comes toward me. I hold her shaking hand through my open window. She is wearing bright pink scrubs, top and bottom. She is a helper, but now she needs help. 

Everyone is just pretending not to see her need. He leaves. She doesn't want to give her name. She walks down the ramp back to the other road. The cops might take a while but they are looking for them, so I should stop blocking traffic and be on my way. They will call me later for a statement. I drove to the next exit and then circled back to see if she was still walking. I didn't see her. I pull into a parking lot to cry. 

If he does that in public what does he do in private? 

What would our world look like if we all chose to help instead of looking away? How can we build a community where everyone feels responsible for each other's safety? What would you have done if you had seen her? What would you want someone to do for you or a loved one in her situation?

You rode past in a black hooded sweater shirt with the hood pulled up, a mask on your face and sunglasses and wearing a brown backpack. I wanted to take over a gym I was walking past, so I stopped and stood on the side of the bike path, thinking there was plenty of room for people to navigate around me. You yelled at me to kill myself for whatever reason you chose and then sped past me. Now I'm very secure in my place in life and generally very happy, so my reaction to this was to laugh. After all I do have an edgy sense of humor! But then I thought about all the people who would receive that with pain and hurt and I really didn't find your behavior entertaining or funny. You are a bad person. If I was a person who was suffering from abuse or chronic stress, that would've been really hurtful. If I was a woman that would've been really scary.

"Anyone have experience with Bright dental on mineral point Road? Any input appreciated. Long story short, have terrible dental anxiety especially after a couple bad experiences.
Landed up with a dental emergency late last year. 

Found out after all these years have periodontal  disease &amp; some bone loss.

Had to have upper back molars pulled , which was painful with the injections even after the numbness wore off-can feel the injection sites. 

Went along with a metal partial denture. Said there were no other options. 

They also put a crown on my lower left back tooth March if this year. Now that crown is sensitive &amp; can’t bite down with the partial. 

I have no insurance only through forward health.
Went into debt up the yong yang with this dental office.

I liked them, however, 
was getting an uneasy feeling.
 I should’ve gotten another opinion and they could not refer me out to a periodontal specialist.

Just so much miscommunication at times with this office.

Never got a cleaning had to cancel one before they did this crown, because I had fallen and hurt my foot in my knee. Also, I am without transportation, but that is workable. They understood my circumstances but now they don’t wanna see me because the receptionist said that I said something that I couldn’t afford to continue just with a cleaning &amp; to find some where that would be covered by state assistance or a decent part of it.

I need some serious reviews, please. 
I have to approach them about this crown yet and I don’t really feel comfortable going back there. 

I’ve been an avid flosser/brusher for years. I do have a front tooth implant that’s fine since 2003- circumstances were much different back then.

Someone told me that she knows two people that like bright dental and mineral point Road and a Dr. Rohul Patel.  I cannot find any information on this dentist. Any reviews at all, and some of the reviews I have read are not so great about Bright dental.

Now I’m stuck with this metal partial denture which I cannot use, this crown which I’m going to have to approach them with, and got into over $6000 in debt, which I’ve been slowly paying off which I really couldn’t afford but an emergency happens .

Concerned about my other teeth n just want this all done with so I can eat normally &amp;  be out of pain. I really cannot afford to go in debt much further with my income.

I’ve heard about Marquette University in Milwaukee. That consultation a long wait I’m looking for someone locally who could possibly help me out who’s going to understand my anxiety too.

Any input is truly appreciated. I do have x-rays. I’m not going to post them out here.

"A lot of people really like the bus system and use it every day. However, I personally have found the reliability of it to be questionable and have gotten screwed by it a few times and would not want to rely on it for a daily work commute, especially for a job with inconsistent hours. 

There’s a few things to consider:

The coverage of routes is pretty good. There are bus stops all over the city and you can use the bus system to get to pretty much anywhere in Madison while only having to walk a few blocks. Obviously the farther you get from downtown, the less stops, so if you work somewhere that is a little outside of town, you may find it more difficult to find a route/stop that works for you timing and location wise. 

The number of routes and the times are also pretty good for the most part. Depending on the route, some run as often as every 15 minutes. However, this is only during normal working hours. There aren’t options super early in the morning or super late at night, and on the weekends there are a lot less busses going, so if you need to travel during those times it will take much more careful planning and you may not find something.

When you mention “relying on the bus gods” that is definitely a thing sometimes. The times listed are usually pretty consistent, but it’s inherently impossible to exactly predict something like that. There’s also some things beyond anyone’s control that can heavily impact schedules such as snow, accidents, and construction. 

In my experience, buses arriving early is a much bigger problem than them arriving late. If the bus comes late, you may just have to wait a few more minutes, but if it arrives early, it risks you missing it completely. I have had it happen multiple times where I planned out a route which involved getting off one bus and onto another and I was left stranded because the bus I was supposed to connect onto came earlier than scheduled (by more than just a few minutes too)

You should also be aware that using the bus adds a lot of time to your commute because you need to account for route timings, delays, and any walking you may need to do. Depending on what is available to you, there’s also a chance that you’d have to get to work earlier than you’re supposed to because of the route timing

Like I said, people do it and people love it. Especially if it’s your only transportation option, it’s a good system. But its not perfect and definitely adds a layer of stress and inconvenience",reddit,downtown
"Unhoused on the square I work early mornings on the square, near the top of State St, and there’s a little community of unhoused people who spend a lot of their time there.  For the most part they just mind their own business and there’s not many issues that I’ve witnessed. The only real problems I’ve seen are panhandling, littering and the occasional fight or whatever.  Typical stuff for that kind of situation. 

Throughout the week I’ll see police talking to them and trespassing them from businesses, helping them move their things, or even making arrests. The veterans museum has even started playing music outside where they sleep, on a loop 24/7.  None of this seems to work and they continue to be there when I get to work, almost every morning. 

But when Saturday morning rolls around they have all been removed from outside the museum and the top of state street. Everything’s cleaned up like no one was ever there, and I just keep wondering where the heck they go- and how/why they keep coming back after the weekend?

I know that the police are doing this to try and make our square seem nicer than it is for the farmer’s market tourists, but where are they putting the people?  Do they force them to move by threat of arrest?  Do they take them to a shelter?

"Any affordable housing complexes that actually follow the fair housing act? I'm openly transgender, I'm having difficulty finding a 30% AMI unit and keep on being denied for some pretty absurd reasons such as being denied based on credit without a credit inquiry being done, when I have a 716 credit score and I think it's pretty absurd to need a 750 credit score for subsidized for low-income housing.  


When I got up the waitlist for a 30% AMI apartment, they gave me a call, hung up immediately upon hearing my voice, I haven't had voice training yet and my housing coordinator put me down as my preferred name, so I was like ""that is weird"" so I called them back. They answered the name of the apartment complex and said ""Oh, ummm, we were going off an outdated waitlist and looking for people who needed 2 bedroom apartment"", I had never applied for a 2 bedroom apartment, which is what was weird about it.

They're next to a Hy-Vee and quite a few shops and restaurants across the street, too! The J route goes along the ""loop"" that is Highland Ave so anything on the J could be good.  I also used to live on the near east side just along Atwood Ave and the C route will also get you where you need to go - many apartments in that area are flats in houses though so require some Facebook marketplace searching.",reddit,atwood

"Feeling really lonely as a 23 year old living downtown  I 23F moved to Madison in early July and I’m finding it difficult to make friends. I’ve already graduated college and I’m from the South. I feel I’ve encountered a little bit of classism due having an accent I didn’t know I had until I got here and also a little bit of culture shock. Don’t get me wrong I moved to Madison because I am more left leaning than my peers in the South, but people here have made a lot of assumptions about me (jokes about me being a Trump supporter, country, not being able to understand me, etc). I assume these are mostly jokes but it is getting old. I also have a facial deformity and chose to live in an area where people are generally “better looking”. My apartment consists of students and I have had a lot of them act rude towards me. I know this is my fault for not choosing a better location as I was made fun of for my face back in college. My roommates also poke fun at me for being “old”. I really want to make friends and stop being lonely-my first thought was to get involved with activities. I am an amateur runner so run clubs might be out of the question. I feel like most of my hobbies are pretty introverted activities like painting, puzzles, hiking, etc. I go to the farmers market on state street but I’m obviously not really interacting with people that way. I tried bumble bff but didn’t have any luck there. Is it worth it to pick up a new hobby? Are there any groups focused on my current interests? My coworkers have expressed interest in hanging out but they’re all a bit older (50s) and tbh I want to make some friends closer to my age. Any advice is appreciated!",reddit,downtown

"I think it depends on what you're looking for in a ""big city"". 

For context, I grew up in San Diego, went to school in Boston, and have been in Madison for a little over a decade. Madison pales in comparison; it doesn't even come close. The stores and restaurants here close around 9pm or 10pm, while I was used to being able to grab a bite most places at 11pm or later. I feel like I need a car here, unless I live and work downtown, while the subway system in Boston was great and, uhh, I guess cars are needed in SD as well, but you could still walk down bustling streets without being downtown there.

I miss the quality and variety of food. I miss the caliber and variety of people. I miss the abundance of events and opportunities to go and find something on a whim. Shopping isn't great either, if you're looking for places like Bloomingdale's or Saks. Forget about specialty shops--there was *one* high-end suit shop for my then fiancé to check out for his wedding attire and one real bridal boutique for me to find my wedding dress here. Otherwise, we'd have to go to Milwaukee and Chicago. (We had to travel to find him shoes anyway....) 

I don't miss the traffic jams and bumper-to-bumper rush hour. I don't miss tight parking spots and erratic drivers. The roads are nice and quiet from time to time, and I *feel* like there's less crime if only by virtue of having less people.

That's just me and my past, though. I think Madison could be a good stepping stone for you, as it certainly isn't *dead* and can be lively, especially downtown.",reddit,downtown

"Best Chocolate Chip cookie This was asked 2 years ago.  Have things changed?

I just got one from Capitol Center Food.  A good cookie, and only $1.99.  Chocolate Chunks!

Madison Sourdough ones are good, but a bit large, and very costly.  I prefer cookies that don't cost $4!  The same can be said for True Foods and Batch and Bloom. All their chocolate chip cookies seem similar to me.  I do think Madison Sourdough has superb molasses cookies..  could eat those all day!

Frabonis will occasionally have a basic chocolate chip at check out, and really the cheapest I've seen, so a great value.

I took it to Handel who said ""Looks like you need a new transmission. ""Subaru CVTs are bad, try calling Subaru about an extended warranty."".

The kids are running and jumping around constantly. It literally sounds like they are all wearing steel toed boots when they walk. 

The doors are slammed every time they are opened, and frames on the wall shake in my complex when these kids walk/run around.

"# Setting the Record Straight: Why Edgerton, WI Deserves a Second Look

**Introduction:** Edgerton, WI, like many small towns, has its quirks and challenges. However, the negative perceptions that have been expressed in a recent discussion don’t paint the full picture. Edgerton is a town with a rich history, a strong sense of community, and many hidden gems. Let’s take a closer look at some of the comments and provide a more balanced view.

**1. Comment: “Edgerton is a bit 'dumpy' and depressing.”**

**Response:** Edgerton may not have the flash of a big city, but calling it ""dumpy"" misses the charm that small-town life offers. Many people appreciate Edgerton for its peaceful environment, affordable housing, and the genuine friendliness of its residents. The town is also continually improving, with new initiatives aimed at revitalizing the downtown area and enhancing local amenities.

**2. Comment: “People move to Edgerton for the cheaper housing and that's it.”**

**Response:** While affordability is a significant draw, it's not the only reason people choose Edgerton. The town's proximity to Madison and Janesville makes it an ideal location for those who want a quieter lifestyle without sacrificing accessibility to urban amenities. Additionally, Edgerton’s community events, such as Tobacco Days and Chilimania, provide unique cultural experiences that you won’t find in larger cities.

**3. Comment: “The schools are good, but the town is insular and has nothing going on unless you like bars.”**

**Response:** Edgerton’s schools are indeed highly rated, making it an excellent place to raise a family. As for entertainment, while the town may not have the nightlife of a larger city, it does offer plenty of outdoor activities, including parks, lakes, and live music in the park during the summer. For those interested in more lively activities, Madison and Janesville are just a short drive away.

**4. Comment: “Edgerton is just a bedroom community with not much going on.”**

**Response:** While it’s true that many residents commute to nearby cities for work, calling Edgerton ""just a bedroom community"" ignores the vibrant local culture. The town has a growing arts scene, a historic downtown, and a strong sense of community. The community’s involvement in events like the Edgerton Thresheree showcases the town’s rich agricultural heritage and the pride residents take in preserving it.

**5. Comment: “Edgerton has a ‘methed up’ vibe.”**

**Response:** This comment unfairly stereotypes a town based on isolated incidents. Like any community, Edgerton has its challenges, but it is also a place where neighbors look out for one another, and the community comes together in times of need, as seen after the recent tornado. The town's commitment to safety and well-being is evident in its strong local leadership and active community organizations.

**6. Comment: “The lake is stinky with thick muck at the bottom, and there’s nothing good about it.”**

**Response:** Lake Koshkonong, like many lakes, has its natural challenges, but it is also a beloved local spot for boating, fishing, and enjoying nature. Efforts are continually being made to maintain and improve the lake’s condition. Plus, the lake’s shallow depth makes it a great place for beginners to learn water sports, and the surrounding areas offer beautiful views and opportunities for outdoor recreation.

**7. Comment: “Edgerton is just a smaller, less interesting version of other towns.”**

**Response:** Every town has its unique character, and Edgerton is no exception. What some may see as a lack of interest, others see as a peaceful and unpretentious place to live. Edgerton offers the charm of small-town life with the convenience of being close to larger cities. It’s a place where you can enjoy a slower pace of life while still having access to everything you need.

**Conclusion:** Edgerton, WI, may not be perfect, but it has a lot to offer those willing to look beyond first impressions. The town is full of history, community spirit, and opportunities for a fulfilling life. For anyone considering a move to Edgerton, I encourage you to visit, talk to the locals, and experience the town for yourself. You might just find that Edgerton is the hidden gem you’ve been looking for.",reddit,downtown
"I'm born and raised in WI, lived for seven years in Salt Lake City (which isn't Colorado but similar mountain west climate).  The biggest climate difference is that winter in WI is more intense - you might have fewer cumulative feet of snow per year in WI, but the temperatures will dip below zero way more often in WI than in CO.  The thing I remember distinctly about living in SLC was that it would dump snow overnight then melt down significantly during the day, at least in the valley.  It's far less sunny in WI all winter, a lot of grey days that meant my Seasonal Affective Disorder came back when I moved back to WI.  Summers are also less hot but way more humid.  The ""bugs"" (ticks, mosquitos) are more intense, especially the further north in the state you get.  However, we are having a heat wave right now with max temps of 95, and I don't think it's gotten to 100 here in several years (or if it did, it was a day or two then it dropped the next time a storm front rolled through).  Wildfires are not really a concern here, although we did get a lot of smoke from the ones in Canada last summer.   

Madison is a big water city (we got a lot of lakes), as is a lot of the midwest.  Boating, kayaking, etc is big since there's so many places to do it.  The biggest thing I missed about living in WI is all the green, the boating, and just having so many lakes and water around.  Biking is also a big thing there, at least in decent weather, although there are some brave souls who put on fat tires and do it all year round. The skiing/boarding is definitely NOT as good as out west, but there are still places to go (my husband goes to the Keweenaw in the UP when he wants ""real"" boarding, but even then it's not comparable to actual mountains).   Hiking is not going to be ""as good"" as mountains in CO, but south west WI in particular the Driftless is still a beautiful landscape, and we have great state parks .  Craft beer, cocktails, restaurants are all great for the size of the city we are, but there are more options in Milwaukee and we're only 2.5 hours from Chicago.  

WI in general is a bit of a purple state politically, which is similar to CO; the cities are deep blue, and a lot of the rural areas are red red.  My uncle has lived in rural CO since college, and he's as gun-loving trumper as you can get.  But Madison proper is blue, although there are better cities for people of color in WI.  There's very little outward racism (from what I've been told, I'm white so it's second-hand information) but definitely a ""Not In My Backyard"" contingent that is fine with social programs as long as they don't have to look at them.  Both Michigan and Minnesota have already started to move forward progressively as far as policy, but we just got fair maps for voting so I'm cautiously hopeful that WI will soon follow that direction.",reddit,general madison
"This missing the point. Shabazz offers a different educational experience than the comprehensive high schools, and students WANT to access it, there are barriers. We need to stop thinking about education through an efficiency lens, and start investing in it for effectiveness and high quality learning.

3.  The need to avoid standing still in one place for too long or having your feet stick to the floor and nearly pull your shoes off.

4.  Watching all the fights and other random crazy ass shit that would occur on a regular basis inside or on the sidewalk right outside the giant windows around the backside of the bar.

"I've been going to Vitense about once a week for the past couple years since I took up golf and can say with certainty any place that comes for Vitense's crown will always miss. $20 flat for a Big George is probably the best deal in the Midwest when you factor in the access to Toptracer and having a heated area for both the mat and sitting area behind it. Food is good (little overpriced but not completely outrageous) and the beer/cocktails are priced like any bar (way cheaper than Top Golf/Pinsetters type places.)

Went to Pinsetters once and while it wasn't horrible, for the money I spent (about $110 whereas the same time at Vitense would have been about $35-$40) , I would have expected WAY better.

What we need is to include political party campaigns, 501(c)4 PACs, and even 501(c)3 GOTV mailing lists in the Do Not Call/Mail registries. A list of registered voters can still be public information, but all campaigns should have to cross-check it with a Do Not Call/Mail list first before sending anything, or face strict penalties. 

Unfortunately, the advocacy groups that do very good work to educate voters and advocate for voting rights won't lead on this because they have a mission-based interest in doing GOTV work. Politicians would need to be leaders who listen to voters who want this and pass a law or add referendums to ballots. But they also have a vested interest in campaign marketing for their own elections and reelections. Lastly, Republican legislators recently took away our rights to add issue-based advisory referendums to local ballots, so we no longer have that avenue to express our desire for this on our own ballots. 

I'm speaking with some experience in both professional and volunteer work in election protection, GOTV, doors/calls, election observation and voter education. All of this clutter got way worse after the Citizens United court decision. Campaigns couldn't ""coordinate"" with each other before, but now there is more money funding more special interest campaigns resulting in way more clutter of mail, ads and texts. 

The comments about ""well you should be grateful for your vote"" aren't helping here, folks. We are being harassed and it's an enormous waste of time, energy, money and paper. We need a legally protected right to opt out. The solution is simple, but the laws, politicians and special interests (both good and bad) are deeply stacked against us.",reddit,general madison

"I’d definitely try the Tylosin, it’s what’s finally given my cat solid poops. She can’t be on steroids because she has heart disease. It’s an unpleasant med though in terms of taste, especially since we can’t give it with treats or anything since they need hypoallergenic food. I get mine compounded into capsules that I just toss down her throat so she doesn’t have to taste it. Hoey Apothecary compounds them. 

Another option is to try budesonide instead of pred, though I think the Tylosin is a way better bet. Budesonide is also a steroid like pred, but it’s newer and works directly on the intestinal tract. It’s primarily recommended for cats because it has less risk of side effects (like diabetes) than pred. 

Have you ever seen an internal medicine specialist at Madison Veterinary Specialists? We do because my IBD cat has multiple other chronic diseases, but an IM specialist would also be the best bet to deal with difficult IBD cases. It’s obviously expensive though, so I would try the Tylosin first. 

I’m not trying to push you, since I know this was a post about rehoming. Angel’s Wish, 9 Lives, and Shelter From the Storm are all potential rescues to contact. I think also posting on some of the Madison groups on Facebook might help because I’d bet there’s people like me who have dealt with IBD cats before and would be willing to take him in(I would if I didn’t already have 2 cats, which is the rental limit). You’d just have to vet them pretty well if they wanted to take him in. 

But having dealt with an extremely difficult to treat IBD cat, I really do think you should try the Tylosin first. It only took maybe 2-3 weeks for it to work for us. She didn’t have diarrhea to where she was going several times a day, but her poops had absolutely no form to them for MONTHS, so she was running out of the litter box before she was done a lot of the time. Since starting the Tylosin, she’s had nonformed feces like that maybe 3-4 times in 6 months. So it really can help, and I think you’d know in less than a month whether it’s going to work for him or not. 

Again, I’m really not trying to pressure you. Just suggestions because I’ve dealt with this myself, all across the country but we’ve finally managed to kind of get it under control here in Madison. You can always feel free to message me if you have any other questions or want to talk about him, I promise no guilt tripping :)",reddit,general madison

"Hi, I'm a trans woman. I have been living openly as such in Madison for almost two years now, and I feel your pain, this town was built for and stays loyal to its majority college populace; white cis men and sometimes women. I don't think it's abnormal in any way that this city contains so many people who refuse to listen to us, understand us, or are straight up hostile to us. unfortunately this is where our country is at right now. I personally wish we didn't have to accept that reality, but we must move with caution and awareness wherever we are to stay safe and stay sane. This city is filled with delusional fools just as every large city is. This city is also filled with plenty of scaredy-cats who regardless of what they think, won't do or say a damn thing about you. Trans acceptance is strangely enough at an all time high right now, both genuine and performative, and I've found there are many places where I can be myself, safely. I'm a rare case in the sense that I have unconditional support from my family and friends, and all of my darkest moments have been in the safety of my home, just a few paces away from someone who I trust. I am extremely lucky to have fallen where I have, and my success should not be looked at as something that anyone can achieve through simply living in this city. If you have no support system (which I reckon you probably don't if you are the target audience of OP) you will find hatred anywhere. There is truth to what OP is saying, but there are ways of finding community here. I was just at a queer potluck with damn near every part of the spectrum, and I am part of an employer sanctioned queer affinity group. Insinuating that the only places you will find them are in Chicago or Minneapolis or insert liberal city here is disingenuous. A liberal city will never be one that exclusively houses those who align with us. There will always be unstable people who refuse to understand us, and lash out at the mere thought of living our lives.

I also want to point out that trans women are not a monolith, and seeking opinions or truth exclusively from us does nothing but close yourself off from everyone else. The last thing any trans woman should be doing is pushing everybody away. There are too many hikikomori girls who have (not unreasonably) shut themself off from the outside world. Get off the festering holes of 4chan and Twitter, and go get a coffee or something. If you have the ability, you have a duty to live your life to the fullest and use every ounce of stability and support you have to do it.

If you want to make a PSA for trans women, share a resource. Otherwise it's just unsolicited advice.",reddit,general madison

While respecting your right to your opinion, I'd like to gently push back, particularly on the foreign policy portion of your reasoning. I too am really unhappy with the Democrats' stand on foreign policy. I wish there was more I could do to pressure them to change it. However, I also recognize that Trump would do nearly unprecedented damage to the foreign policy issues I care about. His stated positions make Neville Chamberlain look like a bold bulwark against fascism. The damage he would cause is so great it's worth casting a vote for the opposition, even if I don't agree with her. If the election were less of a toss-up or if you lived in a non-swing state, I could see the choice to withhold your vote (and send a letter to Harris telling her why) as a principled one.

"I voted in favor of the increased property taxes because of the threat of Act 12 reduction in shared revenue from the state to Madison. I didn't have a chance to do a ton of research, but the already existing budget deficit that the mayor said would have led to cuts in police/EMS budget due to incoming mandatory raises plus whatever reduction to the shared revenue from the state (that is already minimal as is) seemed important to curtail. I honestly wish there was more transparency about the budgetary effects if it all played out, but in the short time I had to try to understand the implications of each decision on the referendum, it seemed like the right choice overall. 

The double hit of a budget deficit plus reduced income would seemingly affect all city services.  Madison is a rapidly growing city and that is not something easily compatible with a shrinking budget. Madison *needs* to put more effort into lobbying to get the average per capita shared revenue payment, now—at least for my vote to make sense. Given that the legislature is starting to look more blue now that the maps are drawn relatively more fairly, hopefully this can increase the city's bargaining power and lead to a budget increase down the line.",reddit,general madison
"I appreciate the response. I think the main issue is exactly what you have stated: the ambiguity of the wishlist process and inconsistency of responses when questions are asked is unacceptable. The wishlist process technically following the rules of record store day but making things “confusing” seems more like a loophole for preordering/reserving records than anything else. It kind of ruins the fun of showing up at 3am to make sure you get the vinyl you wished for. For example on regular RSD this past year my best friend and I got to the already growing line at Strictly Discs at 4:45am. We waited in line literally all day, mostly to get two particular albums. When we got to the front we were told one of the albums was sold out. However, people who were much farther in line behind us but had made wishlists received the album, although they arrived at RSD significantly later in the day than us. That to me reads more like a reservation system- not a wishlist system. 

Like I said- I want to support and that was my intention from the beginning. I want to perpetuate the spirit of record store day- and this just so was not the vibe I was hoping for. 

If I had known the wishlist was a way for you to assure my specific business on record store day I would have made my wishlist much smaller and more realistic to what I could afford. I wanted to make my wishlist much smaller once it felt like a preorder or reserve instead of a wishlist, but there was no way to do so.

At the end of the day- sending blunt/borderline rude emails and treating paying customers like they’re inconveniencing you by trying to interact with the processes you’ve set in place for your business seems counterintuitive. 

I understand how it can bum you out as a business if someone makes an extensive wishlist but then cannot deliver on it. Maybe in the future you can be more realistic and upfront about your expectations as a business when it comes to the wishlist system. My responsibility as a customer is to interact with the systems you set in place to help your business. Your responsibility is to create a system that makes the most sense for your business while still showing consideration to all customers. Obviously this system
ain’t it- so it should probably be switched up. 

Again, I appreciate the response and hope to be able to shop at Strictly Discs in the future without feeling obligated by indie store guilt trips to pay out the roof. Supporting local is important to me, but not important enough to be treated like a cash cow instead of a loyal customer.",reddit,general madison
"I honestly understand your point, and I do think it is absolutely valid.  I also agree that tipping has gotten out of control and we don't need to tip every person at every register.

*However,* as a career server, I wish reddit would get the hell off of not tipping servers.  I considered it sort of like a hairstylist - I didn't work for the restaurant really, I worked for my customers.  They got to enjoy lower costs, the restaurant also got to enjoy the same, with the understanding that *if they deemed it appropriate* they'd tip.  I really enjoyed the immediate feedback on my service, and the extra motivation to be the best I could.  And no restaurant is ever going to pay me the 35 or 40 bucks an hour that I was averaging.  

I supported a family of 3 while my husband attended school full time.  I worked a very reasonable amount of hours to do so.  I am uneducated myself and there is no other job at which I could've even hoped to do that.   I think the system could use improvements.  I don't think it should be eliminated - and I think anyone who fights the system by stiffing servers instead of not patronizing places that use tipped employees is a big jerk.",reddit,general madison
"1) I have thoughts on the supply and demand side of doubling the workforce. I'll be honest and say while I see the side of this argument, I also haven't looked into enough ecnomists' opinions on this to get a grasp on the truth beyond ideology and speculation. It sort of feels right, the sentiment, and it sort of feels wrong and maybe complicated. But again, I don't feel comfortable having an opinion on whether doubling the workforce is largely good or bad, which is made more complicated because it's similar to immigration in the sense that the types of high-value jobs that are created matter more than the number, and oversaturating low-skilled labor is a negative. 

All that aside, I wish there was a middle ground nowadays between having too many kids in the most inopportune timing with the worst partner, versus waiting until you're 39 to have an only child and then you immediately divorce and you're both working and have a nanny?? There's evidence that a woman and a family are most economically stable by not only being married but by the wife and the husband having at least a couple years of working experience post high school or college before starting a family. A woman gaining real-world working experience in young adulthood is invaluable in establishing a basic skillset a woman can carry with her in her personal, social, and community life. During gap periods of birthing and raising toddlers, many women have always found little projects, volunteering, or secretarial work even in the patriarchal times of the US. It allows economic resilience when the man is bringing in income but hit by hard times and the woman can provide supplemental income. Some women could have a couple kids and only spend 5 years out of the workforce and would then need to join the workforce if only part time (staying home with sick kids if needed), which is much easier by having a few years based experience before rotting your brain with the stress of toddlers.

I guess my point is, the ""rational moderates"" in these crazy times are going to need to argue to the public that traditional motherhood is good, while acknowledging that there's a couple simple ground rules for economic stability that only require a few years. Starting families at 18 is not the answer. As bad as 40.

2) ""For men and women, the most valuable asset a person owns is their time.""

God this is really the fucking crux of it. Of everything. This is the social collapse of the new norms. Time. Marriage and traditional child-rearing, including intergenerational norms (""oLd WoMeN aReN't YoUr FrEe LabOr!!"") are the most efficient use of time. It's why traditional societies stayed alive. Time. The basis of economics. Efficiency. One parent with higher testosterone working with a brain geared towards competition, and one parent with higher estrogen staying home to raise children, is the ultimate time-saver.

"&gt; fake homeless people

They do exist. 

One fine example was a dude who would hang out at the Food Co-op in Central Sq. Cambridge, MA and act rude to anyone. At the end of the day, he would get picked up by a red convertible (not too different from the ones that would circle the Occupy around South Station back in 2011 and yell ugly crud at the protestors taking part). I wish I had fished out my disposable camera to snap a pic (while some folks love coffee, cigs, drugs, scratch-n-win tickets, hookers or whatever, my simple vice when I was homeless was snapping pics on my travels, and I have accumulated quite an album of shots from my travels through 17 states).

I have also encountered a dude hanging near a homeless shelter in Corktown Detroit (my hometown) screaming nonsense wearing a nice jacket, a nice backpack, and decent haircut. When I approached to offer him some food or socks, he turned and showed me his hands (I also noticed he has very nice, shiny shoes)-one of which had a certain ring signifying a membership into a certain group-and stated ""Do I look like I need socks? Huh? Now take a good look.""-and I backed away and was like ""uh-oookay."" Happened just as I stated it.

 You will not see these guys in the shelters, day shelters, places to get mail, access storage, get laundry done, get showers in, meal sites, advocacy centers (legal, Vet, or otherwise), multi-service centers, or food panties that genuine homeless folks need and regularly access, and yet, they are out there making the homeless look bad.

"Friday, on my drive to Madison, I texted my leader and asked to speak with him at some point that morning. He agreed. I was about 3 minutes away from the office when an obnoxious driver almost runs me off the road trying to merge into my lane. I got in front of him, and we were both waiting at the left turn light. I glanced in my rear view mirror only to see the other new guy who was getting special treatment from my leader. When we arrived, I pulled into the second driveway so he wouldn't know that it was me he almost drove off the road. I went into the office like nothing happened and was confronted upon entering the door by a large man asking if I learned my 5 steps. I was confused to I asked him to explain, and he just repeated the same question. I handed him my notebook, and he pointed to the notes I had memorized from the first day. I explained to this stranger that I was told to memorize a different page of notes by that day, and he told me to ""sit down and work on that."" I hadn't even gotten a chance to take off my coat but I was freaked out by this guy so I sat down and started writing things down from memory. My leader came over a minute later and said we could go into the conference room to talk so I followed him in there. I explained that I felt mislead by the pay on the application vs what I was told in the interviews and then come to find out my second day working that that wasn't even accurate. I also brought up the fact that I didn't know what to tell my friends and family who asked what I was doing at my new job. He said ""we are selling AT&amp;T."" I starred at him blankly, still confused bc I didn't know the company AT&amp;T was for sale. He said he was going to grab an IPad an show me. When he came back he brought the manager with him. They both sat down and proceeded to gaslight me about the application on Indeed that I applied for and what the job truly entailed. I apologized a couples and explained that I wasn't trying to be difficult, I was just confused. I tried to be direct with my questions while also being polite. The manager pulled up the job listing on Indeed to show me that I was wrong about the pay on there and the job responsibilities. It was jot the same application I applied to. After 30 minutes of getting nowhere I was told to join everyone in the main room. The manager was giving a lecture and so I was taking notes along with everyone else. Then we were all free to leave. I went up to one of the leaders and apologized for the text on Wednesday and said that I wasn't meaning for that to come across as an attack on her, and said that I didn't want any bad blood between us. She Interrupted me with an awkward hug and said ""oh no girl, you're totally fine. I was actually going to compliment you on your hair today."" And then she walked away. I left and when I got home texted my leader saying I felt extremely gaslight by the manager and that I no longer wished to work for that company. I also attached a screenshot with the job application that I applied to that had the pay set to $1370-$1490 per week. 
     I learned in my time being there that Costco has kiosks in their stores and they have AT&amp;T in 55% of their stores and TMobile in the other 45% of their stores and they need managers to oversee each store. So basically they train each person starting at the sales rep position and make them work their way up to manager in the 6-8 months before they take over their own store.

"Pitties are innocent and when raised well, can be loving, affectionate, and just the sweetest damned dogs in the world. 

But, because of their muscle mass and jaw, they have been abused and killed for entertainment, turning many into traumatized animals that lash out with incredible violence sometimes leading to death in rates higher than other breeds. Or pushed to be guard dogs and again, most likely mistreated and abused to inhibit a specific response. 

It is very unfortunate. I love pitties personally. So many of them that I meet are just love bugs. I wish there was something that could be actually done to stop the abuse and mistreatment of the breed. 

Also, I am not going to listen to anybody who directly blames the breed. Chihuahuas are 1000x more vicious and angry yet I don't see hate groups for those yappy bastards. 

We have evolved side by side with dogs. We have bred them to our exact needs over millennia. No breed is the way they are purely by nature, they have been bred by humans for our use. We owe them our respect and our love.",reddit,general madison

"As a woman in my thirties, I have become a master at masking. I received a quick diagnosis for ADHD in 2022 through cerebral &amp; I purposely did not want to medicate with stimulants back then, but the Strattera that I was taking didn’t really help much so I finally decided to seek another diagnosis now since I haven’t been a patient with Cerebral in years &amp; I prefer to do an in person eval here in Madison instead of some quick online thing that isn’t thorough.

I know that I have ADHD.  A good friend of mine who is a nurse practitioner who diagnosis and medicate people for ADHD told me four years prior to me seeking a diagnosis in 2022 that I have it. I want to go the stimulant route since Strattera didn’t work for me back in 2022, so I sought out an evaluation with Collaborative Solutions in Psychiatry, per my therapist’s recommendation &amp; OH MAN, I wish I hadn’t taken her advice lol. For the initial virtual intake appointment, I had a VERY LONG list of all of my symptoms that I was able to explain thoroughly. These symptoms have made life difficult for me for a long time. Since my diagnosis in 2022, I have learned so much about ADHD. I am a wealth of knowledge at this point. I know my shit! I know that I have it. At one point I was jotting down all of the Spacey things that I do as a result of my ADHD. It was actually pretty amusing  😆So I felt pretty confident that I would receive an ADHD diagnosis from CS. They performed a quick 20 min test that felt like a game. You press a button when shapes that are the same color pop up on the screen. Once the test was over, I felt very confident that I performed too well. I have been playing games for a long time &amp; I am pretty focused in a setting like that. I honestly felt pretty laser focused that day. I even called the office to let the receptionist know that I forgot I had consumed coffee with 2 shots of espresso in it right before taking the test. OOPS, I totally spaced on that. Maybe it helped me perform better. Maybe not. Who knows. It was just pretty disappointing that that was the only test that they based their results on. 

So then the next appt was a week or so later to go over the results in person with my psychiatrist. She realized that she never sent me the questionnaire that she was supposed to send me weeks prior to the appointment so she printed it out &amp; had me fill out the dang thing in front of her. Needless to say, I felt very rushed &amp; just rushed through all 89 questions. I had to sit there as she scored it. I felt totally invalidated &amp; unheard &amp; I bawled my eyes out after she informed me that I don’t have ADHD, but like a tier below it (“ attention, and concentration deficit”). So she wouldn’t be able to prescribe me a stimulant. Ok, cool. So I gave Strattera another go &amp; again, it hasn’t helped at all. It’s just very frustrating that the long list of symptoms that I explained in detail were not taken into consideration during the evaluation at all. It’s like my personal lived experience didn’t matter to them. It obviously wasn’t fully taken into consideration &amp; their testing was just not thorough enough. My next virtual appt with her was to assess how the medication was working for me (or in my case, NOT working). I told her that it wasn’t helping so she doubled my dose &amp; that was that. The appointment was less than 10 minutes. She didn’t acknowledge how I cried at her office &amp; I felt pretty defeated that I didn’t even want to bring up how the appointment made me feel. It was pointless for me to take it since it wasn’t helping me with my symptoms &amp; the side effects were not pleasant after being on it for a couple months so I stopped taking it &amp; cancelled my appt with them. 

SOOO I’m seeking another opinion with Arbor &amp; have an appt on April 3rd. 

Good luck with your experience with GHC!

"My favorite are Capital and New Glarus, though neither is directly in Madison. Both do excellent if not superior takes on German styles, and with New Glarus you get some pretty good fruit beers as well.

I think Giant Jones makes spectacular beers. I've had a good doppelbock from them, and some other one-offs I've had with dinners that were fantastic. I had some Kveik by them recently thar was very good. I also think Vintage is pretty fantastic. Their beer has gotten better, before I used to think it was middling.

"State Farm took my car I hit a deer and my windshield was shattered and my drivers side mirror was damaged. the car was drivable. 
i called state farm (my insurance) to file a claim. the car is 18 years old sports car, high mileage but its in great driving condition, it has been maintained well. we are paying for full coverage for this car. the accident happened right down the road from my family home so i safely parked it there. it didn’t need immediate tow because it was parked in a private residence.
the agent on the phone ordered a tow truck to take the car to a repair shop of my choice (Sparkle auto body) to get fixed. 
later in the phone call, she explained that the vehicle was flagged for a potential total loss due to its old age. because of this, she then changed where the tow would take my car and took it to one of their facilities.
at the end of the phone call she told me to “say goodbye” to my car, and to get all my personal items out of it. as if they are anticipating a total loss with fixable damage.
after a day we didn’t feel right about what happened. we decided to contact the agent again to see where my car was towed to, and she said some weird response “on this date you gave us permission to tow your car to one of our facilities.” (there was no blatant permission, more like “this is what we are going to do”)
the accident happened just minutes before we called state farm and we didn’t really grasp exactly what was happening to the car. now that we understand we are confused and frustrated with how this is being handled.

has anyone experienced something like this?

does anyone know where my car could’ve been taken?

any advice on how i can handle this situation now? 

i am worried about losing my car, state farm trying to pay me out and taking it to auction where it will be bought for much less than its worth.

"Moving to Madison, Wisconsin - Looking for Advice on Housing, Neighborhoods, and Tips for Settling In Hi everyone,

I'm about to make the move to Madison, Wisconsin for work at the hospital, and I’m looking for advice on a few things to help me get settled.

First off, I’d love to hear your recommendations on the best neighborhoods to live in. I’m looking for somewhere with easy access to public transportation (I’d prefer to live near a bus route that can take me to work), and ideally, not too far from Trader Joe’s, Costco, or other major grocery stores. I do have a car and can drive, but prefer not to rely too heavily on that especially during the winters. 

Additionally, what apartments do you recommend in those areas? I’m hoping to find a place that’s convenient, reasonably priced (I would like a 1 bed under $1600 total with utilities) and ideally has good amenities. 

Lastly, I’m new to the area and would really appreciate any tips on how to meet people and make friends in Madison. Im 26(F) and I’ve moved quite a bit for my whole life so i unfortunately haven’t stuck around places long enough to make friends. I’m hoping that will change with Madison, and I’d love to meet people for career networking but also for hobbies like going out, exploring food places, traveling both locally and nationally, reading, taking pottery classes, trivia nights etc. I’m always looking for local events, groups, or activities where I can connect with others. I’m also a POC so if there isn’t anything I should keep in mind, I’d love to know.

"I wish they'd split trucks and large SUVs into their own class of license already.  They're absolutely the worst offenders when it comes to a lack of spatial awareness.  I daily drove a subcompact in this city for 10 years and the number of times I got forced out of my lane or across the rumble strips by someone in a big ass truck going over the lines not even knowing I was there (the roof of my car was lower than their side mirrors so they probably literally could not see me) would have to be in the hundreds by now.  When they crawled up my ass my entire rear window was just truck grill.  Their headlights caused all the reflective surfaces in my car to shine with the fury of a thousand supernovae.

A guy I worked with bought an early 00s Tacoma to use as a winter beater and you should see this thing next to the average Canyonero that all trucks have become today.  You could probably fit that Tacoma in the bed of a modern truck...if it wasn't for the fact that the majority of them aren't made for actually hauling shit anymore and have huge extended crew cabs that are larger than my first apartment when I moved out on my own.  It's *striking* how huge trucks have become in the last 10-15 years....we just don't notice it much, because the 'normal sized' trucks of yesteryear are now largely all gone because everyone's locked into the suburban arms race of ""Who has the biggest truck on the block?""

If they're going to keep making bigger and taller and heavier trucks year after year (which is only going to get worse as batteries are a hell of a lot heavier than gas), then we need to start requiring people to road test in one before they're allowed to register and drive it on public roads.  You damn sure never see those fuckin things down at the DMV in the spots where you wait for your turn to take a road test because they know they'd never pass it due to rolling through a stop, leaving their lane, taking turns too wide, backing into shit...

I assure you, if they had to road test in one before they could buy it, suddenly trucks would start shrinking again because sales would plummet due to so few of their prospective buyers being able to pass the damn thing.",reddit,general madison

In my mind, the only reason to go to Mister Car Wash, or any ""full-service"" car wash, is to get the interior vacuumed, dusted and thoroughly wiped up.

I get that this is a shitty job that nobody wants to do and it's likely for very little pay. They probably have a hard time putting together a crew of people to do the job. But at this point, why is this company in business? I have done the awkward U-turn in their service lane for the last time.

"Cell service, east side  Ive lived on the east for many years, around the north Thompson commercial ave round-abouts and I’ve gotten horrible cell coverage in this area specifically.   I will get a call on the way home from work, and the call will drop as I get closer to my house.   I also get 1, maybe 2 bars on the latest cell technology (I just got the IPhone 16 Pro Max for example and it’s no better than the 15PM it replaced) w AT&amp;T.   I’ve tried different providers and they all seem to have the same issues in the area.

The dead zone seems to extend from close to the Milwaukee St area, all the way to the end of Thompson/lien road, usually as I’m heading north on Thompson, as I reach the top of the hill and start going down towards east Towne I regain service.  It also extends south to around Milwaukee Street, East to the top of the hill (by the Eagle Crest bar, specially Eagle Crest Dr.) and west to Thompson, Ill get service by Walmart, but once I get to those round-abouts I start dropping bars fast.   I could almost map this exact dead zone out I’ve dealt with it so long.

I was wondering first off has anyone else noticed this issue?  I would be shocked if no one has as friends of mine have.   Since they released the “WiFi calling” it hasn’t been so bad, but before that I could rarely keep a full phone call when at my house. 


I was also wondering if anyone knows why it’s so bad in this area?   AT&amp;T doesn’t seem to officially admit it, their coverage maps don’t reflect the area, but I could map it out almost to the block.  My thought was maybe the airport has something to do with it.

"The State of the American Nightmare 
So, is this a leaked copy of Trump's address to Congress? No. But could it be? Could you turn on your television, tune-in tonight, and hear something so close to this that you’d do a double take? Quite possibly.

My fellow Americans—tremendous people, the best people. And, of course, members of Congress, the ones who are smart, who know what’s good for them, and even the ones who don’t—some of you, very bad people, by the way. And the Supreme Court, who, let’s be honest, was a total disaster before I fixed it. And the great American business leaders watching from home, the ones who really make this country work—you’re welcome, by the way. You’re very welcome.

I stand before you tonight—not because I want to, let’s be clear. I’d rather be at Mar-a-Lago. I’d rather be golfing. But no, they tell me, ‘Sir, you have to do this, you have to talk to the American people,’ so here I am, giving what will no doubt be the greatest State of the Union in history. We should really rename it, by the way. State of Trump. Because that’s what it is. I am America, folks. Some people don’t like to hear that, but it’s true. Very smart people, the best people, tell me, ‘Sir, without you, America would fall apart. Just completely fall apart.’ And you know what? They’re right.

Now, the Fake News, they say ‘Oh, President Trump, you’re wrecking the economy, the world is turning against us, America is falling apart’, but let me ask you something. Have you seen the stock market? It’s beautiful. Some people say it’s down. Some people say it’s up. And those people don’t understand markets. It goes up, it goes down, it goes sideways. Very complicated. You wouldn’t understand it. You know who does understand it? Me. That’s why I’ve never gone bankrupt. Well, I have, but they were smart bankruptcies. Genius bankruptcies.

And speaking of winning, let’s talk about Canada.

Oh, Canada. You know, folks, I never liked Justin Trudeau. Never trusted him. Little guy, weak hands, probably has soft teeth. I don’t know. Looks like a guy who needs to eat more steak. We call him Justin ‘Weak Hands’ Trudeau. And now, Canada thinks they can mess with us? Canada!

The other day, a Canadian official—very nasty, very disrespectful—said that if I don’t stop tariffs, they’d ‘smile while turning off our electricity.’ That’s what they said. They smiled. And I said, ‘You know what? Keep your terrible electricity. Keep it. We don’t need it. We have the best electricity in the world. The strongest electricity. Very powerful, very good.’

And then—this is true, folks, this is real—Canadians, they actually booed our national anthem. Can you believe that? And I said, ‘Wow. Just wow.’ These are supposed to be our allies! But let me tell you, folks, they’re finished. We’re done with them. No more cheap wood, no more maple syrup—and I don’t even like maple syrup, by the way, I think it’s very overrated.

Now, I hear some people—very bad, very dishonest people—saying that farmers are upset with me. And let me tell you, no one loves the farmers more than I do. Corn, soybeans, wheat, whatever they grow—it’s beautiful stuff. But listen, tariffs are tremendous, and sure, they’ve hurt some farmers, but that’s just business. I say, “If you’re good at what you do, you’ll be fine.” And they love me. Farmers love me. They tell me, “Sir, we’re struggling, but we still support you,” and you know what I say? “That’s great. Keep struggling.” Because America is about hard work, not handouts. We don’t do handouts. Well, except for me. I take a lot of them.

And let’s talk about our beautiful National Parks. Beautiful places. Very nice. Too many trees, though. Ever notice that? A lot of trees, not enough hotels. We’re looking into that. Because let’s be honest, who even goes to these places? People say, “Oh, we love nature,” but do they really? Do they really? Because last time I checked, people prefer a golf course over a forest. That’s just facts. Very smart people tell me that.Now, let’s talk about Ukraine. Not our problem. Never was, never should have been. Before me, we were sending Ukraine billions and billions of dollars while they weren’t even winning the war! Can you believe that? I told Zelensky, ‘Figure it out. Maybe call Putin. He’s great at winning wars.’ And guess what? Now he’s negotiating peace. Because of me.

And people say, ‘Oh, Mr. President, you just handed Ukraine to Russia!’ And I say, ‘Well, would you rather I handed it to Canada? No? That’s what I thought. Shut up.’

Now, Gaza—very sad, folks, very sad. Terrible place. But I had a brilliant idea, one of my best. And, folks, nobody loves Israel more than I do. I love Israel. The greatest country. Some people say America is first, and that’s fine, but Israel is very close, folks, very close. Some people, very smart people, are even saying I might be the most pro-Israel president in history. They’re saying it.

So I said, ‘Why don’t we take Gaza and turn it into something great?’ Like Miami but better. The ‘Riviera of the Middle East.’ Tremendous resorts, luxury hotels, the best beaches, only for people who appreciate good deals. And some people got very upset! The Palestinians, the UN, Europe—they all said ‘Oh, Mr. President, you can’t just remove people from their land and build a Trump Tower.’ But why not? I do it all the time. That’s called business. It’s called winning.

Now, I want to talk about something very special, very close to my heart: the Department of Government Efficiency, or as we like to call it, DOGE. Great name, right? I came up with that. Well, actually, Elon Musk did, but I approved it, so basically, it was me. We’re saving so much money, folks. Billions and billions.

We got rid of so many useless government workers. Thousands. And nobody misses them. Nobody. We have Elon Musk, a very smart guy, running it. He’s got a gaming computer in his office. A gaming computer! I don’t know what that is, but it sounds impressive. And let me tell you, we’re cutting so much waste. Some people say, “Oh, but Mr. President, what about the services those agencies provided?” And I say, “What services? Nobody used them. Total waste.”

Now, some nasty people, very dishonest people, are saying, ‘Oh, Mr. President, you’re giving all our Social Security numbers and bank account information to Putin.’ Fake news. First of all, I don’t even know if Putin wants them. Maybe he does. I don’t know. And even if he did—what are you worried about? What are you hiding?

“And now they’re bringing up this thing—this very nasty, very dishonest thing—they’re calling it Krasnov. Have you heard about this? They say, ‘Oh, Mr. President, were you recruited by the KGB in 1987? Were you a Soviet asset? Was your codename ‘Krasnov’?’ Can you believe this? Can you believe how desperate they are? This is fake news, folks. Very fake news. And let me tell you something—nobody’s been tougher on Russia than me. Nobody. You ask Putin, you say, ‘Hey, Putin, has anyone ever been tougher than Trump?’ And he’d say, ‘No, sir, nobody has.’ He calls me sir, by the way, a lot of people don’t know that.”

So they say, ‘Oh, Mr. President, the KGB recruited you when you were in Moscow in 1987.’ First of all, folks, 1987—what a year. What a year! I was making real estate great again. I was dominating New York. Everybody wanted a piece of Trump. The Soviets? Maybe they wanted me. I don’t know. A lot of people want me. But did they recruit me? No. Absolutely not. But even if they did—and I’m not saying they did, but if they did—wouldn’t that just show you how smart I am? Think about it! They had all these people, all these geniuses, all these spies, and who did they go after? Trump. Because I was the best. I was the smartest. That’s why I’m standing here today, folks, and the Soviet Union? Gone. Who won? I did. I won the Cold War.

And these so-called ‘intelligence experts’—who, by the way, are not very intelligent, trust me—are now saying, ‘Oh, there are documents, there’s a file, Trump’s codename was Krasnov.’ Folks, I don’t even like that name. Terrible name. Weak name. Sounds Russian, which it is, obviously, but still. You think if I was picking a codename, it would be Krasnov? No. I’d pick something better. Something stronger. Something like ‘Winner.’ ‘Champion.’ ‘King Trump.’ That’s what I would pick. Not Krasnov.

So let’s just shut this down right now. Fake news. No proof. No evidence. Just another witch hunt. You know who else got accused of being Russian? Jesus. People don’t talk about that, but some say he could’ve been. Who knows? The point is, folks, I was never Krasnov. And even if I was, which I wasn’t, but if I was—let’s just say hypothetically—wouldn’t that be one of the greatest stories of all time? The greatest spy, recruited by the Soviets, infiltrates America, becomes the most successful businessman, then becomes President of the United States—twice. Folks, if I was Krasnov, I’d be the greatest spy of all time. James Bond would look like a janitor compared to me.

So let me tell you, folks, the economy? Perfect. Foreign policy? I fixed it. Crime? Gone. America? Back on top. The only people who don’t think so are losers—and folks, we don’t listen to losers, do we?

So thank you, America. God bless me, and God bless the United States. STATE OF THE AMERICAN NIGHTMARE

So, is this a leaked copy of Trump's address to Congress? No. But could it be? Could you turn on your television, tune-in tonight, and hear something so close to this that you’d do a double take? Quite possibly.

My fellow Americans—tremendous people, the best people. And, of course, members of Congress, the ones who are smart, who know what’s good for them, and even the ones who don’t—some of you, very bad people, by the way. And the Supreme Court, who, let’s be honest, was a total disaster before I fixed it. And the great American business leaders watching from home, the ones who really make this country work—you’re welcome, by the way. You’re very welcome.

I stand before you tonight—not because I want to, let’s be clear. I’d rather be at Mar-a-Lago. I’d rather be golfing. But no, they tell me, ‘Sir, you have to do this, you have to talk to the American people,’ so here I am, giving what will no doubt be the greatest State of the Union in history. We should really rename it, by the way. State of Trump. Because that’s what it is. I am America, folks. Some people don’t like to hear that, but it’s true. Very smart people, the best people, tell me, ‘Sir, without you, America would fall apart. Just completely fall apart.’ And you know what? They’re right.

Now, the Fake News, they say ‘Oh, President Trump, you’re wrecking the economy, the world is turning against us, America is falling apart’, but let me ask you something. Have you seen the stock market? It’s beautiful. Some people say it’s down. Some people say it’s up. And those people don’t understand markets. It goes up, it goes down, it goes sideways. Very complicated. You wouldn’t understand it. You know who does understand it? Me. That’s why I’ve never gone bankrupt. Well, I have, but they were smart bankruptcies. Genius bankruptcies.

And speaking of winning, let’s talk about Canada.

Oh, Canada. You know, folks, I never liked Justin Trudeau. Never trusted him. Little guy, weak hands, probably has soft teeth. I don’t know. Looks like a guy who needs to eat more steak. We call him Justin ‘Weak Hands’ Trudeau. And now, Canada thinks they can mess with us? Canada!

The other day, a Canadian official—very nasty, very disrespectful—said that if I don’t stop tariffs, they’d ‘smile while turning off our electricity.’ That’s what they said. They smiled. And I said, ‘You know what? Keep your terrible electricity. Keep it. We don’t need it. We have the best electricity in the world. The strongest electricity. Very powerful, very good.’

And then—this is true, folks, this is real—Canadians, they actually booed our national anthem. Can you believe that? And I said, ‘Wow. Just wow.’ These are supposed to be our allies! But let me tell you, folks, they’re finished. We’re done with them. No more cheap wood, no more maple syrup—and I don’t even like maple syrup, by the way, I think it’s very overrated.

Now, I hear some people—very bad, very dishonest people—saying that farmers are upset with me. And let me tell you, no one loves the farmers more than I do. Corn, soybeans, wheat, whatever they grow—it’s beautiful stuff. But listen, tariffs are tremendous, and sure, they’ve hurt some farmers, but that’s just business. I say, “If you’re good at what you do, you’ll be fine.” And they love me. Farmers love me. They tell me, “Sir, we’re struggling, but we still support you,” and you know what I say? “That’s great. Keep struggling.” Because America is about hard work, not handouts. We don’t do handouts. Well, except for me. I take a lot of them.

And let’s talk about our beautiful National Parks. Beautiful places. Very nice. Too many trees, though. Ever notice that? A lot of trees, not enough hotels. We’re looking into that. Because let’s be honest, who even goes to these places? People say, “Oh, we love nature,” but do they really? Do they really? Because last time I checked, people prefer a golf course over a forest. That’s just facts. Very smart people tell me that.Now, let’s talk about Ukraine. Not our problem. Never was, never should have been. Before me, we were sending Ukraine billions and billions of dollars while they weren’t even winning the war! Can you believe that? I told Zelensky, ‘Figure it out. Maybe call Putin. He’s great at winning wars.’ And guess what? Now he’s negotiating peace. Because of me.

And people say, ‘Oh, Mr. President, you just handed Ukraine to Russia!’ And I say, ‘Well, would you rather I handed it to Canada? No? That’s what I thought. Shut up.’

Now, Gaza—very sad, folks, very sad. Terrible place. But I had a brilliant idea, one of my best. And, folks, nobody loves Israel more than I do. I love Israel. The greatest country. Some people say America is first, and that’s fine, but Israel is very close, folks, very close. Some people, very smart people, are even saying I might be the most pro-Israel president in history. They’re saying it.

So I said, ‘Why don’t we take Gaza and turn it into something great?’ Like Miami but better. The ‘Riviera of the Middle East.’ Tremendous resorts, luxury hotels, the best beaches, only for people who appreciate good deals. And some people got very upset! The Palestinians, the UN, Europe—they all said ‘Oh, Mr. President, you can’t just remove people from their land and build a Trump Tower.’ But why not? I do it all the time. That’s called business. It’s called winning.

Now, I want to talk about something very special, very close to my heart: the Department of Government Efficiency, or as we like to call it, DOGE. Great name, right? I came up with that. Well, actually, Elon Musk did, but I approved it, so basically, it was me. We’re saving so much money, folks. Billions and billions.

We got rid of so many useless government workers. Thousands. And nobody misses them. Nobody. We have Elon Musk, a very smart guy, running it. He’s got a gaming computer in his office. A gaming computer! I don’t know what that is, but it sounds impressive. And let me tell you, we’re cutting so much waste. Some people say, “Oh, but Mr. President, what about the services those agencies provided?” And I say, “What services? Nobody used them. Total waste.”

Now, some nasty people, very dishonest people, are saying, ‘Oh, Mr. President, you’re giving all our Social Security numbers and bank account information to Putin.’ Fake news.

"I’m being harassed by the owner of Cocovaa For obvious reasons, im posting this from a throw away account. I ask that we please refrain from giving the Facebook posts attention as I would like to see them removed. Everything besides the ridiculous comments is attached here. Syovata Edari, owner of Cocovaa chocolatiers, has been harassing me over a very brief parking dispute that occurred last Friday. For context, and as you can see from her video, I was not on the woman’s property and she approached me first. I was on the street in my idling vehicle, waiting for a spot to open up in the daycare parking lot. I could not have been there more than 2 minutes before she came outside with the video camera. It’s worth mentioning that her business is not open yet, and I was not hindering anyone from going in or out of her parking lot- simply waiting for a spot to open. I would never intentionally block a businesses driveway or otherwise hinder anyone from going inside. Was my parking spot ideal? No, it wasn’t. But I had every intention of moving within a few seconds to make sure I wasn’t in the way, because she had already asked me not to park there about a month prior. I didn’t think a few seconds waiting to pull into another spot could translate into the crazy assumptions she has made about me in her posts. My goal was to simply move on and not interact with her again. So all this to say, I’m not racist or anything else that this woman has to say about me. She does not know me or anyone I surround myself with. Doxxing me on social media based on a narrative that she’s created in her head. I’m a raging liberal lesbian. Is she mad that I drive a truck for my own small business? Mad that I own a home? A home that I bought with every fucking penny of my own hard earned money, by the way. Is white privilege real? Of course, and I would be silly not to acknowledge that. But this was never about race. The evidence to back her claims about my white supremacist views is nowhere to be found. It’s unfortunate she’s turned something so minuscule into actively trying to get people to attack me and pity her. I would have loved to support her small black owned business. I’m not going to continue to list reasons why this is wrong as I’d like everyone to interpret on their own, I’m simply tired of being harassed.",reddit,general madison
"Anyone else notice people beelining across E. Wash? (Not on a crosswalk) I swear I can't be the only one that's noticed this. Granted, I moved here two years ago and only recently (within the last year) started commuting down E. Wash towards the Capital building, so maybe this is normal. 

Specifically between the intersections of N. Marquette and Union St. I've seen at least TEN people within the last few months absolutely beeline it across the road during rush hour. No, it's not to one of the BRT stops or on any type of designated crosswalk. I've watched people casually stroll, walk, run as fast as they can, without looking, right across the street with cars only a few dozen feet away that need to slam on their breaks. Literal twelve feet away from the nearest crosswalk.

Today, I made eye contact with someone maybe 50ft away who decided it would be a great idea to just nod his head and walk in front of my car, missing by near inches as I had to swerve into the other lane to avoid them. Thankfully, that's only the second time it's been me personally, but should I just go 15mph through that area?",reddit,marquette

"Scumbag Landlord 
I’m in need of some legal advice for an unreturned security deposit. I was living in a house for 3 months. After moving out, I was expecting to receive my full security deposit back because I honestly left the place cleaner than I had received it. Boy was I wrong. 

The landlord tells me he will be there for checkout. Doesn’t show up. Next day a new tenant moves in. After the tenant moves in, I receive a text stating the door handle of the dishwasher that I had used the day before was now magically broken and I have to pay for repairs (I have an exit video of the dishwasher that I took to cover myself from thing like this, but not of the door latched closed). Two weeks pass and he makes me an offer to remove $200 from my security deposit with no proof of damage, no receipts, and no itemized list of what was damaged. I tell him no. He tells me he will file in small claims and I say yes please do. After this, I ask for my portion of the security deposit to be returned on Zelle. He says he tries Zelle and it won’t work (we’ve been using Zelle the entire time I’ve been dealing with him). He offers Venmo. So I gladly send my Venmo username. It has now been over 21 days and I still have no portion of the security deposit and no itemized list of what was damaged. 

What am I legally allowed to do in the state of Wisconsin? How do I prove the dishwasher wasn’t broken when I left? Do I need a lawyer to file a claim in small claims court? Do I warn him that I’m filing a claim or just do it? Does it matter that a new tenant had already moved in before the damage was found? Any help is appreciated!",reddit,general madison

"What should I even do with my life at this point? Hey Reddit!

I made a new account just for this post and although I doubt it’s truly anonymous, I’m too embarrassed to post this on my main account. I’ve never even posted on Reddit before I just don’t know what to do and I’m trying so hard not to give up. For some context, I’m a 20 year old student studying at UW-Madison and despite it being a public school, tuition is absurdly high—especially for anyone who is not an in-state WI resident. I come from a semi-traditional loving, middle class family and it breaks my heart but we’ve unfortunately had a major falling out a couple months back to the point where there is zero contact and I’ve basically been completely cut off in every aspect, including financially. They helped with a portion of my tuition and rent and helped co-sign some loans for the remainder of the needed funds. I’m extremely grateful for their love and assistance with everything and I understand i’m not entitled to anything including their money. So since I moved here, I’ve been trying to work on my own side hustles which have been relatively successful but by no means at the level to supplement a meaningful income. I have not had an ‘actual job’ in a couple years due to studying full time but at this point, I couldn’t even pay for a portion of my tuition—let alone my rent. I’ve tried resources through the school but nothing is really sufficient. I don’t know what to do since nobody is hiring me due to a lack of “non entry level experience” jobs and now i’m going to have to leave school after already being stuck with over $100k debt, legal obligations with a pre-signed lease for the same apartment next year which I can no longer even afford now, and very few valid possibilities moving forward. Despite my efforts of finding a job that will even allow me to support myself, it is profoundly difficult to maintain an optimistic outlook when as of right now my future looks so…hopeless (for lack of a better term). 

This sincerely hurts because I love and miss my family so much and I also love being a student but I feel so stuck. I genuinely don’t think I have many other options at this point besides signing my life away to the government to join the military or move to the middle of nowhere to find the cheapest possible studio apartment with a job that at least lets me continue to survive. It just all seems so sudden considering I was making decent enough money and in a great overall place just a few months back even from my entrepreneurial efforts alone. I’ve always been rather confident, outgoing, passionate, motivated/self-driven to succeed, etc. I was so optimistic about my future since I’ve always been extremely confident in my abilities and skills especially when it comes to communication, writing, speaking, etc. as I’ve always been very articulate which has helped in every aspect of life thus far. But None of my past customer service jobs are pertinent to any job that i’d be a good fit for (Sales, marketing, finance) and no employers really care about web and software design, AI, or any entrepreneurial endeavors that don’t include a degree, certifications or years worth of experience in any given field. I’m going to try to continue starting up my own official business and get my LLC but I honestly don’t think at the point where I can thrive at it solo yet. I just don’t know what to do. I always thought my only limit was the sky and that I could genuinely do just about anything I worked my ass off to do. I still have these same traits but reality kind of opened my eyes to the circumstances/ where I’m currently at. I’m sorry for the long post/ rant and if much of this comes across as redundant. I just don’t have many people here to talk about this with that would understand and it’s not like I can call up family any longer for advice. Any guidance would truly mean the world to me. Thank you all so much for your time and any potential help, and I wish you all nothing short of the best in this life. God bless.",reddit,general madison

"Intersection at a s high point and mineral point  I’ve noticed this stop light has changed dramatically. Now, there’s no left turn arrow for the kwik trip side and the associated bank side has a green light at the same time. 

My issue: I can’t even see the people racing up the hill when I need to turn left (from the kwik trip side), and there’s barely enough time for two cars to turn left now because oncoming traffic from associated bank is very consistent, fast, and difficult to see coming up the hill. 

I’ve seen one driver hit already, and I was also almost hit. Some people don’t even realize (of course, that’s the drivers fault for going by habit and not paying attention to the change) that the light has changed, and the kwik trip side will continue turning even though they have no left turn arrow. I wish they put a sign (maybe they did, but I will check next time I’m there, but if you noticed a sign, please let me know because I must’ve missed it in all the chaos) saying, “yield to oncoming traffic” next to light, so that it could be a warning for those turning left as like a, “heads up, now you don’t get an arrow so yield to oncoming traffic.”  

My question: Is there a way to file a grievance for this change? It’s just so damn hard to see oncoming traffic if you’re turning left, and I feel it will, and already has, increase the prevalence of accidents at this intersection.

"Attn: App delivery drivers and the shared ride drivers... Did you all know that the city built two cut outs for you all to use on the North side of University between Francis and Lake Streets?  Why in the hell do you all  insist upon parking in the ""BUS ONLY"" lane?  It can't be too hard to figure out, since many of you pull into and block the bus stop cut outs around campus, so why can't you all figure this out? 

Also, how do you figure that putting your four-ways on is going to make you legal to park on a main thoroughfare?  How hard is it to park on a side street and walk an extra twenty feet rather than completely impede traffic? 

Last year, I had to pick up a disabled passenger outside of the bus stop on Lake Street because a couple of you morons can't be bothered to sit somewhere else.  That person in a wheel chair had to push their manual chair across the street and down a block because you assholes can't be inconvenienced.  

I also get a kick out of the asshats who park in the handicapped parking spots near state street because you can't be bothered to walk somewhere.  Sure, some of you may be handicapped but not the guy I see running to and from his car.  

Also, where the heck is parking enforcement?  I rarely more close to never see any parking enforcement vehicles down town, this might be a great way to help reduce our city deficit.   Maybe increasing the tickets for these type of traffic infractions will help motivate parking enforcement officers if they are given a percentage of that income?",reddit,downtown
"What are your thoughts on these places for a family-friendly corporate event in the fall? Hey, all. I’m not local, but I’m planning an event for our branch located in Madison, WI.

"An apology to Madison. I apologize for my thread asking about affordable housing landlords that would rent to LGBT people after I thought I was being discriminated based on my gender identity and people keep on telling me to take responsibility for my actions.

I know it's a common perspective in this city that if you have a disability and need support then you deserve to be homeless. I've made a few attempts to work but they haven't worked out well due to my cognitive disability, I've complained a lot about being locked out of housing for having a disability and needing support instead of just accepting that I deserve to be locked out of housing. I have played the victim instead of just accepting my place in society and learning to accept that I deserve to be homeless because I have a cognitive disability and I need some support and it's the way things are. 

I apologize for lashing out at people and being upset at what is a predominate view amongst society, that people with disabilities deserve to be homeless and are undeserving of safe or affordable housing. 

I can no longer spend effort on focusing on housing. I've told my case managers I needed more hands on support with finding housing, because I have a lot of trauma when I have to look for housing.  There isn't much support with housing that is provided.

I'm learning to accept that I deserve to be homeless because I have a cognitive disability and to not complain about my situation.

I apologize for complaining, instead of just accepting my situation. I can no longer spend mental energy making frantic attempts to avoid becoming homeless or worry about my housing situation so I won't. This will be my last post on this topic.",reddit,general madison
"A note from the past election (from the clerks letter to poll workers) Redacted for privacy

 

Our deepest thanks and appreciation go to Chief Inspector G D and the poll workers at Ward 89. This resilient team kept a great attitude despite cold temperatures, wind, and snow. They made sure voters received a ballot within minutes of entering the park shelter. Voter turnout for this ward was two percent higher than the average turnout for the city. (Last April, their turnout was three percent lower than the city average.)

We also would like to thank the IATSE Local 251 stagehands who assembled an outdoor heater near each poll worker. They also set up tarps to block the wind and provided hand warmers.

The usual site for this ward gave us a late notice that they would no longer serve as a polling place. Ten other facilities in the ward refused to open their doors for us. This included churches, schools, businesses, non-profit organizations, and apartment buildings. We are still working on a long-term solution. Convincing facilities to host voting has become our biggest challenge in recent years. If you know of a facility willing to open its doors for voting, especially on the West Side of Madison, please let us know.",reddit,west side

"Do not rent with Home Path I'm a 32-year-old trans woman who is autistic. One year ago, Birwood Property Management had sold my old apartment building, Washington Manor on North Stoughton Service Road, to Home Path Property Management, a real estate/investment firm out of Butler WI, who specializes in property development. Back in May of this year, all of us month-to-month leasers were given move out notices so they could renovate and jack up the prices. Basically, I am a victim of redlining and gentrification. Because of this, I could no longer afford to live on the East Side and was forced to pack up and move to the West Side. Because I had to relocate and I have no driver's license or a car, I was also forced to leave my job. During the final two months, my work had suffered because of how bad my depression had gotten. I've also committed such things like SH and I also nearly ended my life. I also ended up spending a week in the hospital because of how bad my mental health had gotten. I did find a place to stay, but now I'm unemployed, drowning in debt, and I've been a complete wreck ever since. So, whatever you do, don't rent from Home Path, don't buy property from Home Path, or invest in Home Path.

"Seeking: Private Landlords. Need housing by May 27th. DESPERATE:

I am in need of an apartment before May 27th, or I will be homeless and I will risk losing my cats. I have no friends or family in the area to live with and my lease expires by that date. I’m getting highly discouraged by applying to larger corporate apartment leasing companies. They all use AI and software to make their rental decisions. I understand that this is how life works, however I need some kind of miracle and I know it won’t happen at a place with such rigid standards. 

Situation:
-I have a low credit score (550) currently and working to rebuild with new job.
-Good rental history. 
-Sales manager with decent pay + commission.
-Clean and responsible. 
-2 cats total. 

Budget: $1450/month (or less). Would prefer even less. Around $1200/month would help tremendously for my overall expenses. 

No roommates please. 

Prefer west side of Madison, but open to other areas. I am very very worried that I will fail my cats somehow by not finding housing. I just need a chance to prove myself. And a chance to rebuild. Leaving an abusive relationship has nearly broke me, but in the end it will be worth it.

"&gt; Edit: To address OP's edit, here's google's AI definition of a public market.

[Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace) (unlike the AI slop machine, you can actually verify the info in this):

In the United States, the term public market is often used for a place where vendors or merchants meet at the same location on a regular basis. A public market has a sponsoring entity that has legal and financial responsibility to oversee operations and, sometimes, provides facilities to house the market activity. Public markets may incorporate the traditional market activity – the sale of fresh food from open stalls – and may also offer a wide range of different products. Public markets may incorporate elements of specialized markets such as farmers markets, craft markets, and antique markets. Traditionally public markets in the US were owned and operated by city governments, but this is no longer the case.

According to the Ford Foundation, what distinguishes public markets from other types of related retail activity are three characteristics. Public markets have public goals, a defined civic purpose. Typically, these goals include: attracting shoppers to a central business district, providing affordable retailing opportunities to small businesses, preserving farming in the region, and activating or repurposing public space
are located in and/or create a public space in the community, where a wide range of people mix, and are, or aim to be, a heart of the community are made up of locally owned, independent businesses operated by their owners, not franchises. This gives public markets a local flavor and unique experience.",reddit,general madison
"This is going to be a long one. I’ve worked for this company under multiple names and currently employed by Gainwell (only recently returned). I will say I’ve personally seen huge improvements to the company over the years. Something I didn’t see mentioned is the fact that a large portion of this company is contract based individualized by each state/program they are representing.  Gainwell and management has its hands tied a lot on what training materials and rules they have to follow. I’ve never read a state contract but have worked for us government and state level contractors and a good chunk of the time if you got to know management you would find out they would love to implement new ideas, technology, and processes to keep up with the times but it’s NOT UP TO THEM. They can advocate all day long and show how things would improve but xyz state reps ultimately make decisions. And let’s all be real, every company could use to pay more, every company is cutting benefits, even the best places are downsizing and outsourcing. We don’t live in an age you are going to stay with a company 50 years, you’re likely going to leave for better opportunities or your role has been eliminated at some point. It’s an age where job descriptions don’t mean anything. As tech and business needs change you have to be willing to pick up extra roles and change what you are doing, and sadly sometimes even then you get the axe if they have nowhere to put you. I’ve butted heads with different managements and flat out not liked some, I’ve never met a direct manager or even director good or bad who has it out to fire a good employee that does the job they are asked and is willing to adapt and accept things will never be perfect when learning a new job or process. I have met corporate bigwigs who don’t know your name who are happy to cut good employees if they think they will get a good deal elsewhere.

"Hello. I was a big fan of Boars Head. I always buy their Everroast Chicken, It’s like a staple in my house. Every Once in a while, a couple times a year, I buy the Boars Head Smokehouse Black Forest Ham as a treat for my dogs. On july 25th, 2024 (one day b4 the big recall) I bought the chicken and had some Ham sliced for my dogs. I brought it home and fed it to them. It killed my daschund and almost killed my frenchie. My son and I tasted it while we were feeding them. We got deathly sick. The first day after we fed it to them, they were vomiting, having diarrhea and falling around in it. The next day, my son and I felt the same way. Within that week, My daschunds throat froze, I was trying to feed her chicken broth through a syringe and her throat was frozen, she then died. My frenchie lived because of how many times I took her the the ER. She went into an immediate adrenal crisis. She lived but she will have to get a shot once a month and take steroids every day of her life to live. I went to my local healthcare system about being so sick over 25 times. They tested for listeria and it was not listeria. Once I figured out that my healthcare system was not going to help me and my son, I started having my own diagnostic testing and imaging done. It was botulism. We ate the Botuliumn toxin! None of us ever had fevers and the symptoms were the same for my family and my dogs. My husband passed on the taste of ham and he was just fine. My son and I were not able to digest food for over 4 months. The doctors had no idea what was going on. I had to figure it out for myself with a lot of research and elimate any bacteria that smokehouse ham could grow and then elimate by symptoms including no fever. If you eat a toxin or poision, you do not get a fever. Northeast Ga Health system would not help me. They said if it’s not listeria then you are not sick. Well, It made my upper gastro system bleed. Inflammation cyst in my pancreas, tumors on my adrenal glands, inflammation cyst and lacerations in my kidneys. My body was bleeding everywhere and we were falling around, too. Double vision, droopy eye lids, both shoulders and legs going numb and tingling, tinkling big blood clots, all with no fever. Turns out, It made so many tumors on my adrenal glands, they were not functioning properly, I had to have surgery to have my left adrenal gland removed. With the conditions of the Jarrat Virginia Plant, it’s no wonder it grew other bacteria, not just listeria. Based on the damage, the only thing it could have been was Botulin toxin C3., it targets your adrenal glands. According to the published FSIS reports, The plant had a leaky ceiling, with a ceiling fan blowing condensation from the ceiling blowing onto uncovered hams. When you combine condensation and smokehouse ham, it can grow a multitude of bacteria. Once you grow Clostridium Botulinum , then vaccum pack it (expose it to low oxygen environment) it turns into the botulinum toxin. We ate the toxin and could not get any medical help because we did not have listeria. Once I figured it out, I told the Dr’s and they refused to listen. If you do not get the antitoxin, it does a lot of damage. I begged for the antitoxin and the Dr’s refused. I called the CDC and begged, they wouldn’t even take my call! I wrote the heads of the CDC and begged, I got no answer back. Now, I try to get a lawyer and they think if it was not listeria then I have no case against Boar’s Head. I reported it to Boars Head immediately and they want to give me $1000 and pay my medical bills. Seems like no one wants to challenge Boars head even though it’s clear that the place was a mess. With conditions like they kept, it’s no wonder it grew a multitude of bacteria! I thought I was paying for quality.

"Please I implore you to stop equivocating the pro transit urbanist movement with an anti car movement, this is simply not true. We, the pro transit group, want BOTH cars and other modes of transportation (bikes, buses, trams, etc) to be successful in a city. This cannot be true unless cars cede some ground that they have held for many years. Ceding SOME (not all) ground is not an abolition of cars because that ground will be replaced by modes of transportation that will effectively free up space in car-specific area by getting drives off the road who don’t really want to drive but are forced to due to lack of other options (thus allowing you more space, or equal to what you previously had, to maneuver your personal vehicle). You, the pro-car union, want ONLY cars and no other forms of transportation to be successful. We are not the same.

Second, I would agree that it is ageist and ableist to REQUIRE people to bike. You shouldn’t be forced to take any transportation you don’t want to. However, should you be provided the opportunity should you so desire to bike? Yeah seems fair. Nobody is FORCING you to take the bus or bike anywhere, please stop acting like the government is going to take your cars away. In fact I would argue that not providing other forms of transportation outside of cars is inherently ableist because then anybody who cannot drive a car is impeded from moving around your city.

Third, should people with cancer, digestive problems, and other issues that impede their ability to walk be FORCED not to drive? Absolutely not, they should be able to drive if they so desire. Nobody, literally nobody, has ever wanted to eradicate the right to drive. The fear mongering jump from pro transit to car abolitionism is absurd.

Fourth, if every single issue in a city was approached with the mindset “well that’s the reality” then nothing would ever happen. As you said we are BUILT ON AN ISTHMUS. It is THIS VERY FACT that necessitates other forms of transportation. People are moving to Madison in droves. WHERE TELL ME WHERE are they all going to put their cars when they want to come downtown along with all the people who also want to live there. We are surrounded by water, we have nowhere to go. Therefore, we need higher density forms of transportation to alleviate all the cars downtown because, unlike housing, you can’t build roads up and up forever. One day unless something changes, the drive from Hilldale to Tenney Park will take 60 minutes because so many cars will be trying to fit through a narrow piece of land we can’t make bigger. How do you get more people though a narrow piece of land faster for everybody? Put those who are willing and able in buses/on bike which will both make me happy and still make your drive from Hilldale to Tenney not an endless traffic hellscape.

We don’t hate car culture, we love multi modal culture. You hate anything that is not car culture. We are not the same.",reddit,downtown
"Lots of moving threads on here that address most of your questions, but basically, Madison would likely be a great fit for you as long as you can deal with the winters. And pretty much any neighborhood would fit that bill, as long as a 15 minute drive to downtown is acceptable. If you want biking/busing access to downtown, that will limit your choices a bit. Also, Madison is nowhere near as expensive as many coastal research hubs, but at the same time, it’s going to be a big jump in CoL from Arkansas",reddit,downtown

"Any support in Madison or advice for potentially taking in a stray cat? Hello! 

Last fall I noticed a stray cat coming around once in awhile at night (cameras) and I put some food out for it (couldn't help it). Ever since then, it comes around 5/7 nights a week (random). I have been trying to get it to warm up to me here and there, and it seems like it is interested, but too scared to come fully up to me. After it eats, it hops up on my door stoop and stares at my front door while cleaning itself for a few minutes, then walks off. Some nights it comes by 3-5 separate times and just kind of looks around if it has already eaten the food. It does not look or act sick or injured.

One of my concerns was that the cat may be a cat that is allowed to go outside from one of my condo neighbors. But it shows up soaking wet after it rains, and it was showing up in the middle of winter when it was very cold, so my cards are on it not being someone's cat. I live on the edge of the city and there is some old barns and farmland not very far so maybe its a barn cat that ventures out at night?

My other concern is if I do live trap it, I do not have a good place to keep it in quarantine before it would get to see a vet as I currently have 1 cat. I called my vet and they said they would NOT take a cat in without and appointment. I am concerned I would trap it and have no where to take it right away and then stuck with a cat that cant be quarantied safely.

Humane Society said they do not do any medical work for cats. Anyone have any resources of just a general advice? The cat has grown on me and now I just anxious in general for its well being and not sure what to do, never dealt with strays in any regard.

"ISO: Consumer Protection Lawyer Hello! 

I need to sue an oil change place for totaling my car. I own my car free and clear. 

I went for a routine oil change with no prior problems with my car before the service was done. 

After leaving I only was able to drive 55 miles before t my car stalled and smoke was profusely coming out from both my tailpipe and under the hood. This also left me stranded on the side of the road in -5°F weather after business hours. 

After letting the car cool off,  I checked the oil, and the dipstick was more than 2x the cars limit (up to the corkscrew) and it was dirty. I documented everything in pictures. 

Through my assessment and what the repairs shop told me, the oil change play didn't drain my old oil and topped it off with 6 qts of new oil, causing too much pressure in the engine and for head gaskets to blow. 

Between the towing fees I had to pay, cost of the oil change, and the damage assessed at the manufacturer  mechanic shop, I'm out at $14k with my vehicle only being worth $15k. 

Any advice on lawyers I can reach out to would be very helpful. Thank you for your help!",reddit,general madison

"Advocate MD I’ve been seeing a lot of posts talking about how long wait times are to see MDs in the Madison area when going through the big clinics and insurance. 

Just wanted to throw out Advocate MD incase anyone was really stressing about getting some medical attention and was unaware that it exists. Instead of going through insurance, you pay a monthly fee (somewhere between 70 and 150ish I think depending on age) for basically a concierge primary care physician that you can see how ever much you need and who can give you referrals or prescriptions or even do some procedures in the office.  There are something like four or five docs that work there and they’re all really highly rated tho I’ve only had first hand experience with two of them. 

All the processes are also so much more transparent than standard clinics. You know exactly what something’s going to cost before you agree to it and there’s no waiting around at the office, the appointments usually run like clockwork. I routinely call and get in to have something done the same day. 

I don’t work for them. I’ve just had an incredible experience having them as my PCP and don’t think I’ll ever go back to a large hospital unless I need emergent or significant care. It’s been a huge relief when something comes up and I imagine it could be a cost effective solution for people staring down the barrel of a six month wait to get something resolved.",reddit,general madison

"Finding rentals with poor credit score Hello! I am an incoming graduate student for the fall semester and I have a decent credit score ~730 but my partner recently had a tank in his credit score where it went from 750 to ~550 because of a past student loan that he had never received any notice of. He has the means to pay off the loan completely, however, this will unfortunately not improve his credit score… He had otherwise made every other payment for his car and credit card on time.

As such, we are having trouble finding a rental property as most places have a minimum credit score requirement for all applicants. 

We are looking for a 1-2 bedroom apartment that allows cats that is less than $1800/ month. Ideally this place would have a in unit washer and dryer and included parking for 2 cars, whether thats off-street or garage parking. We are hoping to move in July/August.

We are both quiet and clean people and we both have more than enough savings to even pay a years rent upfront if we were to find a place that worked with our situation.

"Rights Violation? Hey everybody, Madison born and raised kid here… I recently had a situation happen where I’m looking into getting legal help… I’m going to keep it vague more or less in order to protect my anonymity. 

I wanna preface by saying I take responsibility for my mishaps and mistakes in this story but I truly believe that my rights were genuinely and grossly violated.

On a recent Saturday, I was put in cuffs and sent to the Dane county detox facility for alcohol incapacitation. Though I understand the procedural responsibility of MPD to do this, I do not believe the situation was appropriate for such a thing to take place.

To give context, I was out with friends celebrating some success I’ve been having recently with my work performance and let’s just say we got very drunk through the night. We decided to turn in early due to us having early mornings and split up around 12-1amish. I proceeded to go get some food at one of my favorite spots downtown before I went home, and the line was longer than I expected so I decided to sit down and wait for it to clear up a bit (my fatal mistake). I was already so tired due to waking up early the previous morning for work so I put my head down for a cat nap and just fell completely asleep. I admit that was not a good choice and take responsibility for doing so as I shouldn’t have been this drunk or out this late, but I don’t believe the ramifications are anywhere near proportional.

I was awaken by a police officer and I let them know that I’m just a little loopy and just need to get an Uber home. I stated I could leave on my own multiple times and that I didn’t drive, yet I was put in a situation where I was not detained but was being corralled by these officers outside to their police car. They told me that they do not deem me coherent enough to get home on my own safely, after my repeated protest. I then told them that I could call a family friend and have them be my responsible party if it was necessary since he lived very close by and as I call this man, they put me in handcuffs while he’s on the phone trying to talk to me and proceed to put me in the back of the squad car.

Now I didn’t break any law or get charged with anything but I’m in the back of a squad car on my way to god knows where for god knows what just asking if they could either let me go or take me home, or to a responsible party of my choice since I didn’t break any laws according to THEM. We get to this detox/rehab facility and take all my clothes, shoes, and devices including my cell phone, make me put on a hospital gown, and lock me in a room for seven hours with no time table for when I can leave. I wake up at 6am as usual and am still locked in the room until the woman that filled out my details comes in and unlocks my door, and lets me know that the person who’s allowed to grant my release isn’t coming for another 45 minutes and I am livid, honestly. I finally get released after they forced me to take a breathalyzer test at 7 in the morning in order to grant me my release.

Now like I said, I’m not going to absolve myself of responsibility; I should not have been asleep like that in a public place, especially while drinking, but I don’t understand how it’s not a complete violation of rights if I’ve said multiple times that I do not consent to being put in a facility like that, and don’t have the opportunity to advocate for myself or reach out to a loved one. I was not intoxicated to the point where I couldn’t walk or couldn’t speak either. Moreover, I understand the legality of protective custody, but I wasn’t afforded any of the fundamental rights I’m supposed to be afforded. I didn’t break the law, I am of a legal drinking age, and I wasn’t driving, and was advocating for myself, stating multiple times that I was absolutely capable and willing to leave on my own whether it be to my own residence or a loved one’s.

I’m going to contact a lawyer of course, but I don’t know if it will go anywhere due to the subjectivity of protective custody in Dane county. I am also going to the police station to ask for all the details and footage we can get. Again, I understand I may have made a mistake but to lock me in a room and not tell me anything about where we’re going is crazy in my opinion. 

I am open to any advice, questions or criticism regarding the validity of my grievances, but please don’t lecture or chastise my alcohol consumption. That is not my point of contention.",reddit,downtown

"Doesn't really matter, I work in the valley, but it's the same positions at every store. The variability is based on how many shift managers a store has, which Madison doesn't have a large amount of, amd if there are open positions. They are large enough to have 7 open positions. Anyone who doesn't get those 7 positions will still have a job if they want to stay with the company. Anyone who decides to leave will get a severance. Based on the organizational chart for Madison, they have 12 people impacted.
At the end of the day, it's a structure a lot of retailers already have in place. It's also because the company is not as efficient as it should be and the grocery industry as a whole has had a tough couple years. I've been with the company almost 20 years, does this fit within the culture that the company had in the past, definitely not, but it's necessary.
It also comes down to a newer hire, in a Sr. Vp role, having a large amount of influence. I don't believe this is a decision that members of senior leadership who have been around for 10+ years, including Mark, made.  All the garbage changes have come since the new guy came in.

"I love a ton about living here. 

It's a relatively enlightened place. A lot of educated folks. A lot of people who vote. These are good metrics for a community.

And it is a community. It's big enough to have most of what you need in a city, coming from Minneapolis, but sooo much more tight knit. You actually see people and get to know people here, barring the transient effects from Epic and UW Madison. 

It's so convenient. I'm a sucker for convenience. I'm never in my car for more than 20ish minutes. I can bike to the capitol in 20 minutes on an amazing bike path route. I can go anywhere in town on my moped for half of the year.

I can see the lake from my front doorstep. I feel like lakes soothe my soul in the way the mountains or oceans do for others. That drive in on John Nolen or going past Olbrich hit every time.

The food scene here is pretty excellent, or there are enough spots that I find excellent and a lot of great places to shop as a home cook

The summer festival scene is easily one of my favorite things. Fete de Marquette, Waterfront, Orton, and Willy especially. 

I dislike the cost of living but also I have an amazing life here for the most part so I think it's worth the cost? I pay high taxes but I have 5 parks within walking distance of my house and the snow gets taken care of etc. 

I dislike that we have no music venue that could bring in bigger bands but it's gotten so much better since we got the Sylvee that I cant complain too much. We still get a ton of good shows coming to town even if I have to go to Milwaukee or Chicago for some stuff.

**Leopold's Books Bar Caffe**

* location: Regent St, Madison
* Why I love it? This place is unique and sits in its own niche. I wish there were more places like this. The book store part if fairly small.  With an eclectic and beautiful selection of books. It's also a lounge and bar and it's open during hours when other books stores aren't. 
* Seating/Cafe? Yes! A full cocktail lounge even!  I need to take advantage of this more.  But that experience of sitting for an evening sipping on a cocktail and reading a book is so unique and wonderful. One of my favorite things to do is read away an evening at a bar or lounge, but sometimes i feel like it's sort of frowned up (or maybe that's just me?). But this place is made for it - and it is such a nice way to spend an evening. A perfect place for a casual book and cocktails date night? 

**A Room of One's Own**

* location: Atwood Ave, Madison
* Why I love it? I mean.... we all know this one :) This place is just wonderful. Amazing selection, amazing staff, books you won't find other places, just everything. I've been going to this bookstore since it was down on state street and it was one of the first things I fell in love with in Madison. I will say that this bookstore ties with first place for the highest number of Staff recommendations I've taken home and loved (tied with Mystery to Me)
* Seating/Cafe? No, unfortunately not. But there are so many comfy places on Atwood to hang out and read.  My favorite is about 3 blocks down at Ohio tavern.  Some of my favorite days in Madison are picking up a book at Room of One's Own, walking down to the Ohio Tavern, and sitting out on there patio picking away at a order of nachos (their orders are HUGE, maybe split it with a friend!) and reading the day away. 



I think I hit them all. I just want to say again, we are so so sooo fortunate to have so many amazing independent bookstores in Madison. I love and appreciate them all. Also, if wasn't obvious, I'm such a book nerd. If anyone ever wants to talk books or bookstores, feel free to reach out at anytime! That's something I'm always happy to babble on and on about!

It was so chaotic, and we were told our 3 year old was not good at following instructions and needed to learn to be in a structure classroom. I know I am biased but that is pretty normal for a 3yo, I also believe it was exacerbated by the shuffling and very disorganized and overcrowded gym.

"I have lived in Columbus (OH), Cleveland, Toledo, Lansing (MI), NYC, Chicago, and the mid-sized town I was born in. 

The only place that I'd rate above Madison is NYC, but that's only for very specific goals. I think I'd rather raise a family here, but the public transit in NYC is fantastic, better than anywhere I've lived and it isn't close. 

Like any city, your experience is going to be primarily defined by your neighborhood. There are ""good"" and ""bad"" parts in every city. And which parts are which are gonna vary person to person based on what you're looking for, specifically. 

But as for why I prefer Madison to all the other places I've lived, it's because you don't get the kind of blend of big city amenities with small town vibes anywhere else. Also, the cool events like farmers markets, restaurant weeks, night markets, craft fairs, concerts on the square, great taste/beer and cheese, etc. etc., aren't going to exist in most smaller towns, and in bigger cities they're kinda hard to find. There are a ton of recreational sports options, lots of great parks (for kids and/or dogs), and while I know we have a ways to go to be perfect, the bike routes are better than anywhere else I've lived.

The biggest downside is that we don't have a pro sports team, if you care about that, and no premiere concert venues, so we don't get the biggest of the big name musicians. 

But, Milwaukee has all that, and isn't too bad of a drive. 

As for pricing... Madison has been largely in line with all the other larger cities I've been in, except NYC which was significantly more expensive. I was paying $1650/mo for a 500 square foot studio apartment (with no AC, or any other common ""luxury"" amenities like a gym, or a dishwasher) a decade ago. And shit has only gotten more expensive since. 

But, as I've said, it really all depends on what you're looking for. And what areas you're looking in. Imo, as someone who has been around, Madison is fantastic. And I'll likely be here until I retire.",reddit,capitol square

I lived on the far East Side (more out in the Sprecher neighborhood) and am in McFarland now.  I agree that the East Side has a great vibe to it, but a more precise neighbor hood is going to depend on what type of place you want to live in, and what your price point is.  

That being said, Madison is more accessible than most places in California.  (In between our East Side and McFarland, we spent six year in Tracy, CA, and I worked in the East Bay... so it doesn't take an extraordinary amount of time to get places, like I'm certain you are accustomed)  McFarland is a burb on the SouthEastern area, and I can easily get downtown within 10 to 15 minutes, depending on ""traffic"".",reddit,downtown

"Alders Rummel, Madison, and Duncan are proposing an amendment to restore partial funding to the Office of the Independent Monitor From Alder Rummel's [blog post](https://www.cityofmadison.com/council/district6/blog/2024-11-11/d6-items-of-interest-week-of-november-11-2024) yesterday:  

&gt;I am sponsoring an amendment to restore partial funding to the Office of the Independent Monitor (OIM). The Mayor had proposed cutting $195K from the OIM budget and reallocating it to startup costs for the Imagination Center if the referendum passed and to entirely eliminate the agency if the referendum failed. 

&gt;Along with my co-sponsors Alder Sabrina Madison and Alder John Duncan we are proposing an amendment for $127K to restore 0.6 of a 1.0 FTE Data Analyst position, $2,900 in Conferences ([NACOLE](https://www.nacole.org/)),  $50,000 in Legal Services, and $13,580 for the Police Civilian Oversight Board (PCOB) in the Office of the Independent Monitor operating budget. See amendment #5 [Operating budget amendments](https://madison.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;ID=13540095&amp;GUID=8CD96900-4C15-4B5A-A616-73224D3716CF)

&gt;After a deep dive into the city budget and talking with city staff, we found resources to continue the model of independent oversight to ensure that Madison Police Dept. is accountable and responsive to the needs and concerns of all segments of the Madison community. [More info about OIM and PCOB](https://www.cityofmadison.com/independent-police-monitor).

"Simple and affordable tattoo + high quality work? Hi I’m sure there are a million tattoo threads on here.. but I’m looking for a recommendation for a shop that does walk ins/simple tattoos for a fair price, while maintaining the quality.

"Leap Academy Childcare I’m writing this for families who may be looking for future childcare for their children and may be considering Leap Academy, located on the East side of Madison.
Some things worth considering may include:


-Leap Academy is no longer a locally owned and operated facility. Originally, Leap Academy was a “mom and pop” childcare center, but last year fell under ownership of a company called Premier, based out of Chicago. This is a corporate center. What does this mean and how does it impact the quality in care? Corporate centers have little stake in the communities they serves. These centers typically are prone to expulsion, high turnover and very littler regard on working with families when it comes to tuition, and pay when it comes to their teaching staff. Management of these centers can oftentimes be dispersed offsite, even out of state, and make communication a hassle for families and their staff. 


-Staff turnover: Turnover is undeniably a real issue in the field of childcare. What’s unique about Leap’s turnover is that since the center was acquired by Premier, only one staff member has remained onboard. Many left due to changes made by corporate ownership. Many teachers who provided high quality care and education who were with Leap 5-10+ years decided to find work at other centers.


And, yes, I am one of those employees. I left on good terms shortly after the company changed ownership, but had began looking for a new job once the change in ownership was announced. The writing was on the wall, it was clear that the school I loved teaching at, a center rooted in its community, was about to face some major changes. Over the year I’ve heard about the changes taking place and am truly disheartened to hear that my fears become realities. 
One major red flag for me was when I asked our newly appointed regional director about what would happen with Child Care Counts funding, who would be responsible for ensuring that funding continued to make it’s way into our center, only to be met with complete ignorance to what CCC was.

Anyway, please take this into account if you are a parent looking for a center for your child to attend.  There’s many locally owned and operated centers in the area that aim to serve their communities and meet the needs of the families and children that they serve. 

I’d also like to clarify that I can’t make assumptions of their current staff’s qualifications or experience in this field. But, what I can say is one recommendation I always make to parents who are looking to tour a center is to ask about their staff’s longevity. If the most senior staff member has only been with the center for 1-2 years, take that into consideration. Even myself, when looking for a new center to work for, would ask the director how long they have been with that center, as well as their teachers.",reddit,east side

Recently was presented an opportunity to go down a new life path, but I always thought I would be an industry lifer. That being said, my work experience is primarily in service.

"The list I have for my own and people I’ve known, unsafe situations they’ve experienced could go on and on and on. Of course you don’t have to worry about just walking around and enjoying the business and parks in Madison, but every place has crime and danger especially cities no matter if they are large or small. I’d also like to add that a lot of the crime has increased over the last 20-15 years or so. Both of my parents and their parents have lived here either all or majority of their lives and they have not experienced Madison in this way. And I certainly do not advise women or female presenting people to think that Madison is such a safe place to not have your eyes/ears peeled if walking alone at night. Madison especially for women are at risk at being jumped out at by people hiding in bushes, cars, trash cans anything at night.

"This was shortly after they moved from cooking everything on the grill and serving it up right away to a faster reheating system. The new (32 years ago) process was to cook up the burgers, place the meat into a warming cabinet (for up to an hour or two) and then when they were needed we’d get them dressed up, wrapped, heat them up in the Qing oven (the Q is for quality), and send them up front.  I think this is the way they still do it so I couldn’t say if it was better then than it is now. I do recall that when we had the grilled chicken sandwich the chicken would sit in the holding cabinets for hours because no one ordered them and they were a pain to make even though they were supposed to sit for no longer than 45 minutes.

The burgers were grilled to order at the first McDonalds I worked at and then the store was converted to the Qing system. When it was grilled to order, a burger in the bin was never older than 10-15 minutes. 

If memory serves we always pre-fried the fish-o-filet, mcchicken and McNuggets and put those into a warming drawer where they would sit for up to an hour or two.  Same with the baked apple pie.  It was rough when the senior bus rolled in on Sunday a 6pm and you only had 3 pies ready. I think it took 45 minutes to back them from frozen.",reddit,general madison
"That's an insane take that I'm ""anti"" retailer. You think using that space to store and move cars benefits retailers more than actual foot traffic? Keep in mind the inconvenience for a driver here is basically having to walk an extra 50 feet from a structure. 

I would strongly disagree as someone who actively shopped for years there. (I moved to east side last year) The constant car traffic going through the middle is a problem. It usually consists of; search for a parking spot, can't find one because the turn over isn't there; end up parking in the structures anyway. They even had to put a giant hump in the middle of the mall to try to slow cars down. It makes the entire place hostile to walking and shopping. Only in America would we normalise this type of construction to save people having to walk an extra 50 feet from a structure or lot as better. 

They've paved at least half of the available space with concrete and asphalt, all just to serve empty automobiles and traffic that doesn't make them any money. This is somehow a better shopping experience? 

That's all space that could be used to build up a walkable area, e.g. cart vendors, tables,  that attract people to the location. No one driving through that area in a car is going to suddenly say ""hey let's pop into this shop and check it out"". Cars will be coming to a specific store, for a specific purpose, and then leave. Retailers suffer in that situation. You've gotten the person there but you enable them to stay as little as possible gives zero adjacent sales. Foot traffic on the other hand generates better sustained revenue. 

Strong Towns has a lot better info than I can ever give on this subject. 

https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/1/16/why-walkable-streets-are-more-economically-productive

There are plenty of examples of this in Europe and all over the world where you can still accommodate needed traffic like deliveries through use of collapsable bollards or dedicated delivery spaces, they do this all over Europe already. This  overall creates a better shopping experience for your customers. Think plaza vs road with shops along it. Making it a walkable area turns it into a third space, a public room of sorts, where people will be more prone to stay and spend money which benefits retailers and the city (taxes). 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOc8ASeHYNw&amp;t=13s

IME overall though Hilldale tries and fails to be a walkable mall and is in many ways inhospitable to walkers. I mostly commute by bike and the state of their bike racks is a travesty.

"&gt;Just to add another comment--what could Wisconsin do to make it a better place for black couples?

Nothing.   May I share an anecdote?

I work at an well-known organization at Madison which, to their credit, went above and beyond to find, recruit, and hire me from out of state.  I must admit that I do like my job. One of my ""side"" responsibilities within the organization is to help black employees feel welcome.   I bullshit you not, I've been at this organization for about a decade, and for every black employee we hire, two leave.   We cannot keep black employees here.  I recently had lunch with a black coworker (she is female) who confided me that she is looking for a job back down South. Her main reason?  She can't find anyone to do her hair.  I have convinced her to try to stay and even offered to go to our boss and ask for a raise on her behalf; she doesn't want it, she wants out.

This is a common experience I see with black professionals in my field.  They come and are excited but within a year, the magic dies and they move on. What I see at the institutional level is reflected in Wisconsin itself.  Do you remember the black superintendent in Baraboo who was physically assaulted at a graduation ceremony by an ostensibly racist parent?  Well, just four days ago, he announced that [he is leaving](https://www.wkow.com/news/education/school-district-of-baraboo-superintendent-to-resign/article_844e72ee-e806-11ef-99bd-5b0103c76670.html#:~:text=BARABOO%2C%20Wis.,Rainey%20Briggs).  The black superintendent left, the black police chief left, even the the owner of That BBQ Joint shuttered his business due to white folks complaining about the smell of meat.  We have a black, award-winning chocolatier who is actively boycotted and chased out of town.  Her crime? Opening a GoFundMe to expand her business in Madison.  I'm afraid that David, Marie, or Awa might be next.

You ask what would make Wisconsin better?  Probably more diversity, but that's likely a non-starter.  You have to put yourself in another person's shoes.  Imagine you are black; would you want to live in a State where kids are doing the Nazi salute? Would you want to live in a State where kids put blackface at a game?  Would you want to live in a State where teachers lock a special-needs black student in a closet?  Would you want to live in a State where black kids are racially taunted and the teachers do nothing?  Would you want to live in a State where teachers give black children assignments asking them how they would punish a slave that disrespected them? I would provide citations for every one of the things but it doesn't really matter because my point is that Wisconsin is hostile to black people and, despite its rhetoric, we're not welcome here. There's a reason why Milwaukee - the crown jewel of Wisconsin - is one of the most segregated city in America.

Other options are: Istanbul Market (all halal), India house (definitely sells goat meat, not sure about other types), Restaurant Depot (never been but I've heard they sell halal chicken), Costco has New Zealand halal lamb shoulder and rack (needs to be the New Zealand one with packaging that says halal- they have another one too)

"You've already gotten a ton of great advice but I just wanted to chime in as a fellow human who also wants to change the world -

1) Please, please, PLEASE do not apologize for wanting to make things better. Yes, there are a lot of hurting and angry people out there who lash out at idealists like us (and to be fair, there are a lot of people who fancy themselves as idealists but are really ""white saviors"" or doing it for the wrong reasons, and that's a big problem), but the absolute best majority of people out there doing the work are going to be thrilled to have you join their cause. The world needs more people who are passionate about making life better for their fellow humans. Do not apologize for being a good person. 

2) As another person suggested, going to college can actually be a great way to help, depending on what exactly you want to do. For example, if you decide you want to enact policy change, law could be a good path, or political science, etc. I know with everything going on in the world right now, that might seem like an insane suggestion, but I personally think that if education is within your means right now, it's probably one of the most important ways for you to resist. I got my undergrad degree in a liberal arts field, and while I didn't end up working in that field, the education itself was what led me to become a social justice advocate, a critical thinker, and an overall better member of society. If you're not sure what exactly you want to do right now, it's totally okay to explore your options for a few years before deciding. And honestly, Madison College is a fantastic resource, both for career planning, AND finding ways to get involved in our community. The school is very committed to equity in our community, and you might find some options for involvement that you hadn't thought of. 

3) You didn't say exactly how old you are, but since you keep referring to yourself as a kid, I'm guessing you're high school age or maybe recently graduated. The beauty of being so young is that there are so many options to choose from! But having so many choices can be very overwhelming. I am a person who has always wanted to do all the things, so I get this struggle completely. I'd suggest starting with causes that interest you the most. You seem to be particularly drawn to homelessness, so starting there is great! Others have suggested good resources for you to start with, and I'm certain the people at those places will be thrilled to have you. 

I say this with all of the love in my heart - do not get discouraged if it turns out that this particular cause is not for you. Social justice work is HARD, and homelessness in particular can be super, super difficult to address. You may love the challenge! It might turn out to be exactly what you want to dedicate your life to. But it may also be too much for you - and that is okay. Remember that there are lots of different ways to help, and your skills and talents may be better suited to different roles or different causes than you expected. Be gentle on yourself and take care of your mental health. Learn about yourself, know when you're starting to get overwhelmed, and know when you need to take a break. We need more people like you in the world, so make sure you take care of yourself while you're out there doing your work!",reddit,general madison

"Is Madison’s Zoning Code holding the city back? I’ve been thinking a lot about zoning and density after reading ""Abundance"" by Ezra Klein, especially his point that liberal cities often talk progressive values but make it really hard to build new housing. Madison feels like a case study. Housing (or the lack of it) might be the issue of our era, and I personally chalk it up to the fierce zoning laws that have ruled over us for decades, blocking the growth needed to keep a city healthy. I’m curious how others feel.

Klein calls it being “symbolically liberal and operationally conservative”: places that proudly display inclusive values, but quietly uphold systems that block change. In Madison, it’s common to see those “In This House, We Believe…” signs in front of homes whose neighborhoods oppose even modest new development. Our zoning code is a good example: beyond the basics like keeping factories away from schools, why is it still so rigid and complex? There are 34 different zoning districts in Madison, not counting the special ones. Why can you build a duplex on one block but not the next? Why are cafés or corner shops illegal in most residential areas unless you go through a long approval process? Why can’t we, the community, be trusted to grow the city organically? Why instead are we bound to the decisions of a few people sitting on a zoning committee decades ago?

It feels like a centrally planned economy, slow to adapt and hostile to innovation. Zoning maps rarely change, even as our population grows and our housing needs shift. Ideas like tiny homes, co-housing, or small mixed-use buildings are often outright banned. And it’s worth asking: how much of what we love about Madison today (the quirky mixed-use buildings, the beloved dive bars, the older neighborhoods) would be illegal to build under today’s rules?",reddit,general madison

"Center running means far reduced conflicts with other traffic. Madison's BRT get watered down slightly, but without the center running lanes there's effectively no chance it would qualify under the ITDP's definition of BRT. That effectively requires center running for ""normal"" circumstances.

The scoring is weighted by distance on the route so it wouldn't *all* have to be center-aligned. However, to qualify for BRT, it needs at least a score of 4, out of a maximum of 7, on its ""busway alignment"" subscore, among of course other requirements. The only ways to get at least four points are: (1) center-running on roads like mineral point/E Wash (7 pts), (2) a bus-only street (7 pts), (3) a busway running "" adjacent to an edge condition like a waterfront or park where there are few intersections to cause conflicts"" (7 pts), (4) a counter-flow bus lane on an otherwise one way street (6 pts), (5) using the inside lanes of a pair of one-way roads (a couplet) (5 pts), and (6) when there is a central road paralleled by a service road, using the outside lanes of the inside road (4 pts). A curb-aligned busway on a two-way road, even if there are bus *lanes*, scores *no points*.

There are a couple parts of the east-west BRT route that would still qualify for some of the better categories (e.g. the one-way couplet downtown, but that still couldn't get above four points without a rebuild of the contraflow bike lane on University), but they would be dragged down by the vast majority of the route that would likely score no points.

Now, at some level the standards shouldn't be held as some gospel from God or whatever. But the flip side is that presumably the people who made it at least *kind of* know what they're talking about, and there's a good reason for considering center-running a la Mineral Point as a Tier 1 configuration and curb-running as normally a Non-scoring configuration. (That reason is conflicts...)",reddit,downtown

All of the insanity we’re dealing with so far has been executive actions. 

I agree with r/IBSattacker, Tammy could do the same, she could place holds on bills or nominees, should could force them to do roll call votes, she could deny unanimous consent for every motion or order forcing them to invoke cloture.  She could actually fight for constituents who were [unjustly fired in Wisconsin](https://captimes.com/news/government/federal-layoffs-in-madison-hit-dairy-research-va-hospital/article_10360b04-f08c-11ef-a600-2f1aeccd6aaa.html) by publicly declaring she won't vote for a budget unless those are fired are reinstated.

Tuberville blocked military appointments for 2 years for bathroom trans shit, so don't tell me that Senators can't do anything, There's a lot Tammy could do, she is a friggin' United States Senator for God's sake, but she doesn't because she is a coward. 

The only nominee she voted for that I agree with Rubio, the rest are DEI trash.  Tammy voted to confirm Duffy  as Secretary of Transportation and two days later 67 people died.

I don't know this woman sleeps at night.What we need in the age of Trump are progressive warriors like AOC, Crockett, Frost, and hell, even Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.

The Democratic party needs to have our own tea party movement.  We need to get rid of these old, corporate democrats and put in progressive warriors that will fight for the American people. The people here who are claiming she is doing enough, don't get it: Democratic voters are fed up with their elected officials doing nothing against Trump.  In my view, the Democratic party should be shutting down the government until they extract concessions.  It worked for Republicans like a charm during the Obama and Biden administration but Democrats are too cowardly too institutionalist to do something that could provide leverage against Trump.

Just a PSA, if you live on a County Trunk Highway, and your candidate support sign has disappeared from your lawn in the last few weeks, there’s a chance it’s been picked up by the Dane County Highway Dept, who used a tape measure and found it to be in the County ROW (right of way, 33’ from the centerline) and removed it. All ‘Public Safety Issue’ signs are taken back to the shop with the address of the property on the sign, where they will be held until 30 days after the election. To inquire if they do have your property at the shop, call 608-266-4261 M-F 7am-3:30pm and a very competent and friendly person will assist you.

"If the city of Madison got $1 for everytime a cyclist broke or ignored road laws that apply to them, the city would have enough money to fix it's budget in 1 week.  Honest to God the worst users of the road are the cyclists in this city. I appreciate that the city accommodates cycling. People riding cycles is a great thing but the people who cycle certainly don't accommodate anyone else. 

The number of times I've seen cyclists run red lights, even into traffic forcing drivers to hit their breaks, is well into the triple digits. I've seen cyclists so many times ignore a pedestrian crossing and nearly run them over, while all the cats are waiting for the pedestrians to cross. I've had myself and many of my friends and family nearly hit by cyclists or cussed out just for walking on the all purpose trails. 

I could keep going, but I'm sure many of you have had the same experiences. The city of Madison needs to enforce road laws on cyclists too, because they get away with way too much and it's very unsafe.",reddit,general madison

"Small Business Saturday  I don’t know who needs to hear this, but you’re sleeping on some amazing independent bodyworkers/massage therapists in the area. There are so many great massage therapists in the area that people are hesitant to try due to the lack of Google reviews. There are a couple of massage establishments (on the isthmus) that I have tried and had a terrible outcome the times that I visited although they had 100+ 5 star reviews. Plus, most of the small businesses listed don’t expect tips which makes the total price cheaper than most of the massage establishments!

Alchemy Bodywork
Neuromuscular massage
—He is a master of his craft. If you have specific issues that you have been dealing with for a while, he can definitely help! 

Chill Therapeutic Massage
Therapeutic barefoot massage, cupping, deep tissue 
—The most thorough barefoot massage I have experienced in Madison. I highly recommend for the athletic type and those looking for deep, consistent pressure. 

Divine Anatomy
Relaxation, Ashiatsu, prenatal
—Relaxing and reviving in a very beautiful space. She pampers you. If you’re pregnant or looking to relax, this is the perfect spot for you! 

In Good Hands
Sports, deep tissue, myofascial, lymphatic drainage
—He is super knowledgeable and can relieve your aches and pains effortlessly. Definitely recommend for the athletic type and folks who deal with chronic pain. 

Nomadic Healing Arts
Relaxation, deep tissue, trigger point, hot stone
—This space is super cozy. Be prepared to melt into the table. Perfect for people of all backgrounds!",reddit,isthmus

"Using separate contractors (Electrician, HVAC, plumbing) vs all in one company I closed on a house recently and need a few things done as follows

- updating the electricals in the dryer from the current 110V line to a 220V line to accomadate to a heat pump dryer
- update the electrical to the stove (from a 40A to 50A)
- creating a sub-panel to the utility room to possibly add a heat pump water heater in the next few years
- install a vent to the roof for a range hood
- possibly update the furnace


The first thing I did soon after I closed was to get maintenance done on the HVAC system. I used All Comfort Services because they were the ones that installed the Lennox furnace. ACS recommended I change my furnace on account of one of the heat exchangers being cracked. Looking at the Carbon Monoxided levels, it seemed a bit suspicious. So I contacted RG Heating out of Waunakee and they verified that everything was working correctly. 

ACS also does electrical and plumbing work and they gave me estimates for the above work
- replacing the furnace was $6.5k (if it's a High Efficient furnace)
- replacing the furnace with a dual fuel is 14k (but they suggested I would get 4-6k in rebates)
- install a 50 gallon gas water heater and update electricals in utility room -$6.1k($4.5k for installation of water heater plus cost of water heater, $800 for updating electricals and $700 for installing water heater safety drip)
- $8k for a hybrid/heat pump water heating (this includes similar costs as above, but the difference is the cost of the water heater)
- $1600 to install 240v for dryer
- $400 to update the breaker for the stove
- $1550 to install a vent for the range hood

Needless to say I feel like I'm ripped off. I talked to a good friend and they suggested I talk to Cardinal to get a seperate quote. But after reading through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/1dlgupe/hvac_in_madison/), I will most likely stay away from Cardinal since they are even costlier.

But in the long run what I've realized is

- I would prefer to get an electrician (possibly someone from local 159) to update electricals to fit my needs
- install a range hood by someone else
- use a separate company to install a water heater down the line
- wait for the furnace to break and then update the system. Stay away from Lennox, since their part availability is bad and use someone else for the HVAC(possibly Harker or RG from the above thread)
- heat pump for the HVAC seems to take a long time to break even. I would like to install one and get away from gas. But it might not be feasible for a few days of the year. 

Does anyone else have better suggestions or if I'm going wrong in any of the points? Are there all-in-one (HVAC+electrician+plumbing) companies other than ACS and Cardinal people recommend around here?

I am going through union electricians who are available for the work. Primary issue is I'm planning to move in by the end of July. So that might be an issue.",reddit,waunakee

"I can tell you my experience. I live around 35 miles south of Madison. I just had our two baths replaced this year and 1 laundry room cabinet put in. My recommendation: look for another company. My experience was a nightmare and I’d never use them again and wouldn’t recommend this company to my worst enemy. 

We signed up to get a quote and a sales guy came out to our house. At first he seemed friendly and nice but after the whole experience we realized how manipulative and deceptive this company really is over the coming weeks. 

We informed them, multiple times up front, that we were interested in getting our baths done but earliest being in a few months, and after winter. There were a couple reasons for this. One, I was paying off financing for our fence and I didn’t want multiple project financing payments going on and 2, we have a few reptiles and we cannot have our doors open in the middle of winter in freezing weather as our animals could get too cold and sick. They informed us they would have to leave our garage and door to our home open most of the time they were there working so winter was not something we wanted to do. Plus, I don’t want my door open and have my furnace running for 14 hours nonstop in WI winters. I told them this multiple times through the whole process. 

The sales guy, after we signed a contact for an overpriced $38k for two baths and a cabinet, then called me a couple days later and told me they had to send our financing back through for reprocessing. He said nothing had changed. When it was sent back, I noticed the price was almost $300 higher. When questioned, first he told me it was an error with financing and he’d fix it. Then he called me and told me it was essentially my fault as the math wasn’t correct in his estimate and if I looked it should have noticed it should have been higher. He changed our financing amount that we already agreed on and gaslight me telling me it was essentially my fault he can’t do math as I should have checked his numbers. Thats not how you do business. I work in finance. Mistakes happen but you don’t fault the customer if you make one. That’s  just unprofessional and vile. 

I was promised, by the salesman, that it would take 8-10 weeks for product to be made so I could easily order it then and by the time it was ready to install, it would be closer to the end of March and was told it could be installed a week or two after that. I was also told that Dec, when I had the quote, was absolutely the only time they were offering 5 year 0% interest if you qualified and I had to do it then if I wanted that deal otherwise it wouldn’t be an option. He also insisted even then that due to likely tariffs their costs were estimated to go up 25% in 2025. I honestly believe after everything with this company that they lied about financing options as well to pressure people into sales they aren’t ready for quite yet. 

I was dumb and caved as I had the credit for that financing. I also noticed the salesman overinflated our income by at least $100k to the loan company to get us approved he told us he does that for everyone to get easier approval, which seems like loan fraud to me. What I also realized after the fact when they already ordered the cabinet was that he swapped the dimensions on our laundry room cabinet and completely lied about the timeframe. I received a call the first week of January telling me product was in and I had to install it within a week as they will not hold product. I got a call from Lindsey who handles more local people I was told. She was so damn rude. She made it abundantly clear she wants nothing to do with customers or that she doesn’t care about what works for you for install as she tried to pick the install days for. 

I ended up having to fight this company. They ended up telling me when they would install our product and cared nothing for what we had agreed on or our concerns. They picked the day and time of install. I was also told I should be happy it was early as other customers would be happy about that. It was dismissal and gaslighting at its finest with this company. They do not care about your needs or concerns, only about making money off you. We ended up having to fight to get the cabinet done correctly, as the sales guy marked it down incorrectly, as again, he didn’t listen to our needs. 

The install overall was fine and the product is ok but after the weeks of bullcrap I put up with from them I’d never do business with them again.  The product is nice but after using them now, I would say you can get similar work done for not as high of a cost and likely a better customer experience. I will caution you though, if you get a quote, as others have said they may not leave you alone to try to get your business. 

I ended up having to file a BBB complaint to get the additional money back they tried to charge me after changing the contract terms and price. This company is shady and fraudulent and I’d be very weary of doing business with them. They lie and manipulate and are insanely pushy to get sales. The cost isn’t worth it and neither is the bad overall experience. They’ve become just another overpriced corporate company that cares nothing for their customers.

Be weary of google reviews as well. They essentially guilt customers into leaving 5 star google reviews by telling them they won’t offer financial incentives to their installers doing the work if they don’t get a 5 star review on google. If you have to guilt customers into 5 star reviews, by telling them you won’t pay your installers incentives for doing a good job, that says a lot about your company. It tells me you wouldn’t have as good of reviews if you didn’t manipulate your customers.",reddit,general madison
"Dude, I’m sorry but you’re delusional if you don’t think there hasnt as been a complete 180 by those protesting in Madison from the 1960s to today.  Go back look at photos from that era, it was against war period, their signs read things like “War is Never the Answer”, “Give Peace a Chance”, “Make Love not War”.  Now it’s all support of Ukraine’s refusal to come to the table and continue the war.  It would be funny if it wasn’t so pathetic what’s happened to what appears to be the same people protesting then and now.

I agree with you that Ukraine needs to be part of the conversation in resolving this war, as does Russia, the US and the EU.  But guess which one of those has rejected the opportunity to take a step towards resolving this, Ukraine.  And what to these protesters do?  The run out and knee-jerk reaction screaming their unconditional support for Zelensky and Ukraine just because Trump pissed him and them off.  

Zelensky did a terrible disservice to his country by his actions Friday, he needs to look at the bigger picture get on board with getting a peace deal in place.  Sorry but he’s not going to win this war, so it’s either resolving it now, getting the West directly involved or losing later.  He’s tried getting the US involved by adding a security condition and to Trump’s credit he was shot down.  Maybe he can get the EU to go to war with Russia, he seems to be getting some traction there.  But without a wider war in Europe Zelensky is in the best negotiating position now to reach a peace deal, the longer war goes on the worst it’ll be for Ukraine.",reddit,general madison

"Carrier here, not in Madison though. The political mail is technically junk mail, but we have to treat it like first-class. For other junk mail, a carrier would might be able to get away with not delivering it for a quite a while, but not with political mail. At my office, if political mail isn’t deliverable, we have to endorse it with the reason why (typically a house/apt being vacant or it being addressed to someone who isn’t living there anymore; most have “or current resident” but there are some that do not), the route number and our initials. And then put it somewhere separate for just political mail.

If it is your carrier deliberately not delivering it, it’s a big deal. It’s also a Hatch Act violation. It’s hard to get fired here, but I’m assuming this one of the things that would get a carrier immediately fired. 

And I’ve seen a lot of comments on here mentioning a lot of Trump mailings and barely anything from Harris. I’ve maybe delivered ~3 different ads total for Harris so far. I’ve been getting 1-4 Trump ones daily for the past 2 weeks or so, and more before that, just not as frequent as it is now. In most cases, the lack of Harris political mailings is just because they aren’t sending out a whole lot yet. Otherwise, anything that shows up on informed delivery may not show up on the exact day you get notified of it. It’s happened to me and a few of my customers. I sometimes get the daily email of my incoming mail and some doesn’t show up until a day or two after. It could also be an issue at the place that sorts the mail. I’ve heard from a few clerks that the political ads essentially wreak havoc on the machines that sort it. That could be another reason for a delay.

And another two here that are similar:

-Carrier accidentally misses it (we carry or have in the truck a tray of letters pre-sorted // a tray of flats that we sort ourselves, which is magazines, paper-sized flyers, letters that can’t go through a machine, letters that are mis-sorted by the machines, and anything we missed the day before // a tray of small packages // larger packages not in a tray // sometimes another additional mailing that goes to every house/apt mailbox). Lots to keep track of. Most of the time, everything that I do have is all delivered day of, but it’s super easy to make a mistake and miss something on accident. If mail is missed, we are not supposed to or even have the time to backtrack. If we miss a package, we have to go back and deliver it, but not for the mail. If a carrier does miss a piece of mail, it is to be brought back and delivered the next day.

-The machine that puts letters and letter-sized fliers in order for us is not the greatest. I frequently get mail for out of town, mail on my route but put in the wrong place by the machine, etc. This is another thing that would be brought back to deliver the next day, or sent out to the office that it belongs to. 

Please continue to report it if it continues happening. They will take it seriously and should take action if it’s the carriers fault and they are deliberately not delivering things for the candidate they don’t like. I’m hoping that this is a case where the carrier is not deliberately doing this, but it could be and that’s terrible. I don’t like delivering all of the mail I get that’s pro-Trump, which most of it is right now,  but I would never in a million years choose to not deliver it intentionally. They paid for it to go out, it needs to be delivered.  Choosing to not deliver political mail for candidates you don’t support is also election interference in my eyes. I find it super important for everyone to be able to vote how they want to, to vote in general (I have some friends who don’t vote and it’s infuriating to me), and if people choose who they vote for via political mailings, that’s how it js. I deliver every piece of mail that I am given unless it’s legitimately not deliverable; if I accidently miss some mail while on route,  
it’s kept and delivered the next day. Most carriers are the same but with everything, there’s always a few that don’t do things correctly or break the rules on purpose.",reddit,general madison

**Bike People**: John Nolen Drive is awful! It's Mad Max! It's dangerous! We need a fix!

In my view, when people prioritize their desire for an unobstructed view of the capitol building over addressing the *ostensible* need for pedestrian and cycling infrastructure it isn't just NIMBYism, it crosses the line into idolatry where the value of an inanimate object is held to a higher esteem over the *ostensible* needs of real, human beings.  Frankly, I don't want to hear any more complaints from the bike people, they've rejected an overpass, have successfully lobbied the city to change perfectly good road for a vanishingly small minority of commuters that cycle,  and who engage in deliberate misinformation that our roads are unsafe; when, in reality, Madison has some of the safest roads for cyclists in the country (I would provide a cite, but why bother?), but reading this sub, one would not be faulted for thinking otherwise.",reddit,downtown
"&gt;What do people general do if needing an appointment same/next day if kiddo is in need of it?

Your first step is to establish care with a primary care physician. Do this as soon as possible for everyone in the family, because scheduling might push your appointment out several months. As others have pointed out, your insurance will cover certain doctors/clinics and not others, so insurance is your first stop for figuring out which doctors/clinics you should consider.

At the time you need care within the next day or so, you should call your primary care physician's office. They generally keep some gaps in their schedule for immediate needs, especially for the kids. However, they may also have some disagreement with you about what exactly is an immediate need.

If that doesn't work, the next step up is called Urgent Care. How exactly Urgent Care works varies from clinic to clinic, but you'll either just walk in or call ahead to make a same-day appointment. Like your primary care, which Urgent Care centers your insurance covers will depend on your insurance. Urgent Care usually has broader hours (like weekend coverage) that your primary care doc doesn't have, but they're not open 24/7. Urgent Care can handle both things like infections needing antibiotics and also injuries like cuts that need sutures. There's also been a recent expansion in telehealth services, where you might be able to get some things taken care of with a phone or video call, but they haven't figured out how to suture with your iPhone yet. Urgent Care visits will usually cost you more than a visit to your primary care doctor.

If you need to deal with a medical emergency or have an urgent need and urgent care isn't open, the next step is an Emergency Room. Generally you want to avoid it, but sometimes you can't. ER visits will be the most expensive. Again, you'll want to go to the ER of a hospital that works with your insurance if at all possible, so you should learn which hospital(s) in Madison would be good for you.

Your insurance provider or primary care doctor also will likely provide you with some sort of nurses hotline to call when you aren't sure if you need to be seen. I think this is usually free to you.",reddit,general madison

Parking Utility is currently budget-neutral, in that they take in money, and spend that same amount.  We turn those parking ramps into cash cows, and then we milk them.  2024 revenue is $17 million, we can squeeze an extra $4 - $5 mil out of that no problemo.  Added bonus - folks will drive less. 

Houseboat permits.  Wouldn't it just be amazing to have a small houseboat on one of our awesome lakes?  We need more housing too.  Win-win.  Maybe this could be a City-run Airbnb, where the City buys and rents houseboats, or maybe a bring-your-own houseboat option.  I would pay $150 a night to sleep on a houseboat in Lake Monona, and I bet I'm not the only one.  

This one I call the ""Party Pass"" - for $50 (or some other amount), you get a free pass to do as much drugs and alcohol as you want, exempt from arrest, for a 24 hour period.  Like you're in town for a concert, and you're drunk and high on who knows what, and you're only 20, and then out of nowhere, it's the cops.  Oh shit, right?  But then you pull out your official Madison Party Pass, and instead of handcuffing you, they high-five you and move on.  For an extra $20 you're exempt from public urination ordinances too.  

Enhanced enforcement of parking in disabled spots - People who park in disabled spots out of laziness are assholes, they make the lives of disabled people that much harder.  Fuck those guys, am I right?  We ramp up the enforcement on this.  From what I've see at Woodman's, this will be like a license to print money.  

Better vending machines in City parks.  The current vending machine scene in town is weak AF.  We could take it up a number of notches.  I think it would be cool if I could get a shot of SuperCharge Foods Wheatgrass from a machine at Tenney Park.  Or some locally grown carrots from a machine at Olbrich.  Or even just a bottle of water sometimes when it's hot out.  Supports local businesses and organizations in addition to raising funds.  

Anyhow, thanks for considering these, and thanks in advance for all of your wonderful ideas.  If we put our heads together, we won't even need a referendum this fall.",reddit,tenney

I went into my building using the reflection to make sure he wasn't coming up on me, but he kept walking. Thing is, unless he happens to live in one of the two buildings on this dead end (I've never seen him), there's nowhere for him to go. So he turned back around. I saw him going back the other way two minutes later from my window.

"What is Madison doing to address homelessness? I'm currently volunteering at a community mental health clubhouse dealing with people suffering from mental illness and some of the things I am hearing from homeless people I work with are frightening and I am looking for where I can go for more information about how the city is effectively addressing homelessness and how I can get involved in homeless advocacy?

First thing I want to ask about is the safety issues in shelters, I hear about stabbings, people not feeling safe, I hear that when someone brings in drugs or weapons into the shelter then they bring out security, but only for a day and there is a lack of security in shelters. 

The second thing I want to ask about is for a comment about the fact that the city removed all the bus stops about a half mile from the Men's emergency shelter making it difficult for people with disabilities with mobility issues to access support, often people complain about the inaccessibility of transportation around shelters and services. They are built out in the middle of nowhere, without a lot of access to other supports via the bus, often with the service some distance away from the closest bus stop.

Another frightening thing I am hearing is that after the city cut the funding towards the Men's Emergency Shelter, then the first thing they did was remove the Job's department and support followed by the Housing department and the housing list provided by the shelter has hotels listed as housing, is there anyway I can confirm these allegations?

Second, I'm really interested in getting into social work, and becoming an advocate for people experiencing Homelessness, how can I become a better advocate for people experiencing homelessness and what are some resources I can connect with?

One of the main problems with services I find is this perspective that ""We need to make the environment as uncomfortable as possible to motivate people"" and essentially it gets to the point where the environment becomes harsher and harsher and it gets to the point where people try to end up in jail because they feel more comfortable there, I talked to someone who volunteers at The Beacon and we talked about this philosophy in the services and he mentioned that they removed the board games because they don't want people to be too comfortable, so people just sit there all day, and it's like ""how is that going to help people?"" and how he noticed that a lot of people tend to be mean to homeless people for the sake of being mean. What happens is this philosophy and mentality develops, they start slowly removing all the supports that were present when the shelter first opened such as showers as an example and it adds more and more barriers and the services become less and less efficient.

The fact of the reality is that there are people who are going to be in the shelter system for the remainder of their lives, we need to change our whole perspective of poverty of something to be punished and criminalized and start gradually supporting people with complex systematic issues and barriers such as connecting them with individualized support, and providing the services that the public thinks are actually provided. Right now, we are so against providing even little comforts that give people meaning, and prevent them from just giving up and turning to drugs and our current approach to homelessness isn't working.

The main point of my question is, how is the City of Madison addressing homelessness?",reddit,general madison
"Homelessness around the square  Spending some time around the square this entire weekend, it was striking how the coffee shops, empty store entry’s and bench’s were full of homeless folks.  There was a small cleaning crew out to sanitize and clean an area where some has stayed overnight and likely(based on the bleach) clean waste.  

There was nowhere available to sit at the Starbucks early Friday morning because the seats and center area were occupied by homeless individuals and their belongings in baby strollers/bags.  Stopping at the colectivo around the square there was significantly more seating but there again a decent amount of booths and areas occupied by the homeless.

We were asked for money once at Starbucks, once in colectivo and around the square.

It did feel like the homeless population at least in those areas was much higher then I can recall. 

Not sure on a solution, but it was very sad to see.  Also, a bit of a concern with the waste and sanitation crew.",reddit,capitol square

"Almost crashed due to Culver's Value Basket - a plea for awareness I had a pretty scary encounter this morning that I want to share, both as a cautionary tale and a plea for awareness. While driving, I was given the green left arrow from East Washington to Livingston.

They didn’t even seem to check if their flight path was allow them to fly into my mouth instead. 

I love Madison and its cheese-friendly environment, and I fully support a curd’s right to choose its flight path. But with that comes a responsibility for all curds to be aware of their surroundings. It’s crucial for curds to LOOK before flying and ensure they fly into my mouth, especially when accompanied by a Pretzel Haus Pub Burger.

"I don't mean for any of these ideas or thoughts to imply anything specific in the situation with ALCS. Just need to thought dump.

Has Madison had any gun buy backs or gun lock giveaways? 

What do parents need to help them better support the needs of their teens? Are there PR campaigns for combatting teen loneliness, supporting their identity development or friendships or preventing online radicalization? 

Are there resources for parents to learn how to monitor their children online, including ways that children avoid being monitored by parents?

Can we make it a legal obligation that parents and schools inform one another of observed signs and work together to supervise and support children who show concerning signs? I wonder if schools have IEP's for kids who show signs of hopelessness. Are there best practices around steps parents and schools can/should take when there are concerns?

Are there best practices around incorporating a new child into a new school / classroom? For years school counselors have been doing ""lunch bunches"" to create a smaller group to facilitate new friendships between students who struggle in larger settings. Often during recess teachers work behind the scenes to send a child or two over to the new kid to be their friend. I wonder if there are studies or best practices around that process that could be created into a digestible reference sheet for long term subs and newer teachers. This is by no means meant to imply that it is the teachers fault, just sharing observations from across districts. 

When new schools receive a child who attended previous schools, that child's information should be required to be reviewed to make sure that it is safe for the child to be in a regular education setting and that teachers feel comfortable and prepared to meet their needs. What ever happened to a ""permanent record""? This extra screening in the private school is especially important because you're less likely to have the additional supportive services. It's better to prevent a child from experiencing an additional school transition than to try to work with the child and end up failing the child. I hate saying that because I've seen kids flourish in these settings that I did not expect and kids don't always get to be in the best match school but at the same time it should be the schools legal obligation to be as prepared as possible to meet the known needs of all the students in their care.",reddit,general madison
"Need auto help/reccomendations Hi Madison friends,
I have an auto problem I am hoping someone could help me with. Specifically recommendations.

My car has a part that is rusted out and needs to be replaced. I took it to a shop, and he couldn’t locate the part from the manufacturer as it has been discontinued, he tried an after market replacement next which didn’t fit right, and lastly he got a replacement from the junkyard. This junkyard replacement was too rusty to warranty (less rusty than my original part, though) but he installed it anyway for no cost and gave me the after market part to take for free. Bummer, but whatever, came out in a slightly better place, but still need to have this part replaced at some point. 

ANYWAY. I called the dealer in town and they confirmed the part was discontinued and there was no stock available throughout the country (crazy for an 09 car…). Ugh.

So, I have this after market part which is a few inches too short, and my original part which is rusted but the right shape/size. I think I need to find a garage that can fabricate this aftermarket part to fit my car. The junkyard replacement will only last me so long.

Anyone have tips of a garage that is trustworthy that does fabrication like this? The part is a fuel tank filler neck, FYI.

"Umm, that track is nowhere near ready for passenger travel unless you like going really slow.  The Milwaukee -Madison route was originally served by C&amp;NW.  However after that service ended the tracks were abandoned and now make up a chunk of the Glacial Drumlin Trail.  In fact, the more popular route thru Madison was out of Chicago. 

  The best plan is to build new lines that actually go to the locations folks need to go.  That means downtown areas, that means through the neighborhoods that love the idea of trains, but dislike the effect on “quality of living” and property values.  See also why the Madison-Milwaukee plan went to the Madison airport rather than anywhere remotely useful.

   First of all, thank you to everyone for the overwhelming flood of kind words and suggestions. Even the one person who offered me free tires they had listed for sale, but were unfortunately the wrong size. I was trying to spin a very shitty situation into the best one I could, mostly just making that post to vent and get it off my chest, in hopes that the person who did it would have a better year. 

   One specific person went above and beyond for me, which I never would’ve expected. This type of kindness I thought was something I’d never encounter. For context, I was already stressed about my front tires. They had maybe, MAYBE 1mm of tread left (No clue what that is in the typical 32nd tread depth measurement, but it’s definitely legally bald), had been unemployed for close to 2 months (Started the new job on the 2nd), with nowhere near enough money to handle this situation.

"&gt;Why is there not rapid mass transit between a metro area’s core city and one of its suburbs?

Rapid transit to all of Madison?  So what if the bus dumps us at a transfer point, we still have to get the rest of the way.  The buses don't even adequately cover all of Madison *now*.  I know, they're improving it, great...*what about right now?*  10 years from now will be awesome for people 10 years from now.

&gt;To your flat point about ridiculously expensive housing in Madison, I also agree, which is why I also advocate for local housing reform, and again, support advocacy organizations.

Again, what about *now*?  More houses available in 10 years will be great for people 10 years from now.  In the meantime, all the commuters forced to drive because they can't live in Madison due to cost, what exactly are they supposed to do while they're tearing all the major arteries up *now*?

&gt;It’s a state capital? So fucking what?

State Capitols are, by definition, always going to have a lot of traffic from elsewhere.  I doubt there is going to be rapid transit from fucking Fond du Lac.  So what are all the people that have to come to the state capitol for business needs supposed to do?  Wormhole?  What about people coming into town to go to one of the hospitals here?  You know, like the VA?  Hey grandpa, I know you can't walk and shit and we live 4 hours away from the VA hospital, but you're not allowed to take a car down there, we gotta put you on this train.  Seriously?

&gt;What’s *your* solution to your peak rush hour commute? One more lane?

See, unlike a lot of people here, that grew up in one stoplight towns out in Cow Country, I grew up in a big city.  Population \~5 million.  With extremely robust public transportation, levels of which make what we have look like some dipshit on a bicycle giving people handlebar rides down east wash.  Do you think all the fucking roads around there are 25mph single lane thoroughfares?  Of course not!  The roads are still jam-packed with cars, even with buses, tons of rapid transit, shuttles, light rail, and that's *with* 4-lane 40mph arterials to carry the traffic, highways running right through the heart of the city.

Both *have* to be able to efficiently coexist.  It's only going to get worse!  Look at how much Madison has grown in the last couple years.  You think Mineral Point is a tragedy now, wait until we have 400,000 residents in Madison, and another 250,000 in the suburbs commuting in.

This city has a world-class university, a research hospital, plus all the governmental offices down there.  In what fucking universe are we ever not going to have assloads of vehicular traffic going to those destinations?

That's what I take issue with.  We're building for a future that's not going to become reality for decades at least, and the response to people saying ""Yo, wait a minute, people need to be able to get to these places *now*, too!"" is ""HURRDURR TAKE THE BUS YOU FUCKING FUCK!""

"Planet Fitness 100%. 

As far as cancelling, easiest way is to go in to your home gym and the only thing youll be asked is why (they have to enter it into the computer) and youll provide one signature. As long as you're in by the 10th of the month or before ( monthly billing is on the 17th) you wont be charged anything else. Same idea for the $49 annual fee that comes out 2 months after you join on the first of that month, if you decide PF isnt for you then just make sure you are in to cancel at least 7 days before the billing date. 

If for some reason you cant come in to your home gym, you can mail a letter with your name, current phone number (include old numbers it could be in a list if you have changed numbers), a message saying ""i would like to cancel my membership"" and why, then sign and date it. The membership will be cancelled as of the day the letter is received, so that deadline i mentioned earlier will still apply and you may be charged for one final month if it doesnt get there in time. PF's website reccomends using certified mail, but from my experience they do not seem to care and you're just wasting money, ask your specific gym to be sure. 

There are no cancellation or buyout fees, and there are 2 different tiers of membership, the classic and the black card. 

Classic is $15 a month and only includes access to your home club, the PF app, and a personal trainer, and unfortunately none of the Madison clubs have had one for at least the past 7 months. 
It has a higher startup cost than the black card, without a special offer its $39 plus prorated dues to start a classic membership. This is a decent option for you if you know you only want to use the workout equipment and locker room facilities, and if you know you will always only be going to one gym. 
If you decide this membership level is for you, join under the black card and then go back at least 24 hours later to downgrade the membership. You will have saved $38 if you start a classic membership this way. 

The Black Card is $24.99 a month and includes the same things as the classic with significantly more perks. With this one you can also go to any PF worldwide, bring a guest (one guest at a time, must be 13 or older, they cant use BCSpa), access guided workouts in the PF app, use the black card spa (includes massage chairs, hydromassage beds, tanning, total body enhancement/beauty angel/red light therapy, and some locations have ""wellness pods""), get 50% off select drinks from the cooler (gatorade and water usually, locations may vary for other discounted options), and access partner rewards and discounts like 20% off Reebok or there was a promo for free meals from Hellofresh. 
The startup cost is $1 plus prorated dues, so you wont pay any more than $25.99 to start this membership even if you joined on the day the billing cycle flips over. 

Both memberships include the $49 annual fee that would come out December 1st if you join before the end of October. If you decide to cancel after the annual fee is paid, it will not be refunded in any amount, but to be fair its still cheaper in every way compared to places like Crunch or Gold's where you're locked into a contract at $60 a month for however long and would have to buy your way out. 

Also if you end up moving after that annual fee is paid, you can transfer your membership as well so you dont end up paying an extra annual fee by starting a new membership.

As far as equipment and quality of the gyms, at least 2 of the Madison gyms were recently entirely renovated or moved and have a large selection of beautiful new equipment. Unless you are a bodybuilder or a serious lifter, they should have everything you need to have an average routine workout, and if you find they dont suit your needs then there's no contract to hold you hostage. 
The gyms ive seen are generally kept nicely cleaned and stocked, most of the employees ive met are at least neutral if not kind and polite, and the sense of community ive seen between members is the most heartwarming thing ever. Most of the time when someone loses an item, someone else is quick to find it and bring it to the front desk so its safe, so its also nice to know that the Madisonian kindness is strong in the Planet lol.

I hope this was helpful and that you can find a gym that works for you!",reddit,general madison

Now, thankfully that the council is majority-minority, they have finally [have approved body cameras](https://www.nbc15.com/2022/04/20/madison-common-council-approves-police-body-cameras/) as a pilot, but, unfortunately, the majority-minority council is following the path laid out in the 2021 recommendations. The 2021 recommendations laid out by white residents, Tom Brown and [Keith Findley](https://secure.law.wisc.edu/profiles/kafindle), want the pilot to be a:



&gt;

Basically, these white folks who wrote the report (and that the city council ostensibly co-signed) is that they don't want body cameras for the sake of transparency, they *only* want it if there ""is statistically significant evidence of an decrease in charging rates"". For those who have ever been in academia, this is essentially whitespeak for it's never going to happen. The majority-minority council needs to cut right through the bullshit and approve body cameras outright. The papers written in 2019 and 2021 are nothing but delay tactics should be thrown in the dustbin.  It was stupid, the issue shouldn't be whether body cameras increase or decrease charging rates, the point is to ensure there is evidence of the arrest. 

Now, that's the truth.

However, the narrative these people, including you here, will tell you will go something like this, ""Oh! We care sooooooooo much about the African-American community that we decided not to listen to the Urban League or NAACP who have dutifully and collectively represented the national and local interests of African-Americans for over 200 years. Instead of listening to these venerable organizations that have local offices in Dane County, we have decided (because we know what's good for them) to listen to a bunch of radicals who opposed body cameras (because doing nothing is easier *and* cheaper than doing something)."" I'd also point out a post from u/tommer80 who went to the the city council meeting.  You can read his or her post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/15g1f5p/comment/juhe3tx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), but they said, in part, ""**it was amazing to hear public members who were Black speak and say they support the pilot and invoked a transparency argument and said let's get going as everyone else around us has body cameras. Contrast that with public members who were White say the don't support it for, what I thought, were a lot of obscure reasons and some clearly hate the police. You can't make this stuff up.**""  But, of course, this cuts against the narrative that it is black people who are fault as to why a majority white city won't have police cameras.  

This whole thing is what conservatives get right: white progressives give no shit about black people or wants or desires unless it conveniently intersects with their wants or desires.   In the end, you all are no different than the white folks you claim you're opposite from because none of you - white conservative or progressive - actually listens to what the fuck we have say.  We're literally telling you that we want body cameras, the Urban League and NAACP supports body cameras, but here you are saying that we don't.  It's bullshit and it's deliberate misinformation in order to buoy your viewpoint. You base your view on us from your ""feelings"" not facts: case-in-point, none of you can show me ounce of evidence from the NAACP or the Urban League which have collectively represented black people for over 200 fucking years that we are ""against"" body cameras.  But, keep listening to Freedom Inc.  I guess it makes you all sleep better to listen to them who represent a fraction of what black folks think than organizations that represent the majority of us.",reddit,general madison

"I think one of the most surreal days was the day that Biden's 2020 election was confirmed. I'm not out to ruffle anyone's feathers or get into a political debate here. 

I just remember that morning hearing car horns blaring on East Washington, my sister texted me with the news minutes later. 

I hopped on my bike and rode through the isthmus. From the Atwood area through campus, state st and the capitol square. People were super stand-offish since we were in the middle of the pandemic. We weren't supposed to gather but on that day no one gave a shit. There were church choirs singing in the streets amidst a motorcade that made downtown nearly impassable. It's almost a blessing that the pandemic was in full swing. Had we not been in ""lockdown""; I'm convinced a huge brawl would have erupted followed by a city wide make out session. That's probably what Madison needs more than anything now that I think of it.

I can only describe the vibe as a mix of Forest Gump, West Side Story and the Simpsons. The whole time I was humming the ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" theme song. ""Oh the Red, White and Blue! Oh the funny things you do! America! America! This is YOU!""",reddit,downtown

Fords seems like a cool spot but just not my vibe as it feels more geared towards the bodybuilder community. Did Planet Fitness which was fine and also the best deal out of everything and had much more space at least but nothing special.

Pocan is everything right with politics right now. Of course he has no power, the system is working, but he’s reliably on the right side of the issues in a way that doesn’t divide his base. I knew a couple guys who worked in his office from the gym and they were both supremely good people.

He isn’t particularly flashy from the perspective of reading the national news, but in all the good ways he’s like Greg Gard this season. Puts in the work. He’s progressive enough that he probably can’t get primaried and the dingleberries the GOP puts up against him are candidates that have no expectation of winning.

Pocan could maybe make a run for Senate someday but even that doesn’t seem likely, I can’t imagine his ceiling is much higher than where he is. But there is a dignity in being well suited for the office you hold.

Honestly, the drinking age being 21 is stupid anyway (should be deliberately tied to the age that someone is allowed to sign a legally binding contract or sign up for military service...if they're old enough for that, they're old enough to drink responsibly), but regardless, it's just so ridiculous how lax things are with alcohol usage in this state yet legalizing weed is still something that needs to be debated year after year.",reddit,general madison

“Michael Green filed a federal lawsuit against Fitness Ventures, LLC, a Crunch franchisee with locations in 27 U.S. states, claiming he was discriminated against for being a Trump supporter – not for causing a disturbance, as a police report obtained by The Independent shows.” 
“Green reportedly had “approached other gym members and screamed and cursed at them” because he wanted to use their exercise equipment, the report states. It says these members asked the manager to have Green removed, but did not wish to press charges against him.”
It couldn’t be me having a public meltdown! They must hate me because of my beliefs!
“Two weeks before filing suit against Crunch, Green sued another Madison health club over similar allegations”
Seems to be a routine issue for him… the police report shows he was harassing the manager because she was a Democrat.

And now, a collection of quotes showing his persecution complex, and how it’s Democrats “fault” he voted for Trump…

“Perhaps it was some kind of retaliation for being a Trump supporter, even worse a [B]lack Trump supporter in Dane County.”

“Over the course of 40 minutes, Green, who said he voted for Trump in 2024, railed against DEI initiatives, the transgender community, and the “liberals” he insisted were responsible for pushing him into the president’s arms.”

“I’m not a cult follower, it’s just living in that area, them telling me that he’s bad… that made me say, ‘OK, well, I’m gonna vote for him then,’”

I was politically disengaged in 2019. My family were all Trump heads, super religious, and called my older sister “fucking stupid” for not thinking Trump was ordained by god (not a joke). Jan. 6th was a wake up call, but it’s the behavior of MAGA supporters that have always kept me from that camp. The persecution complex, the lack of ANY accountability, for Trump, but also the supporters, the anti-intellectualism, the lack of empathy, etc.

":( self conscious about my weight gain and lifting gains/making friends I moved to Madison about ~5 years ago with my ex. I didn't have time to do much exploring/making friends due to trying to quickly find new employment and then COVID hit. My ex and I had different hobbies and some similar ones. Eventually i gave up my hobbies that were different and tried to pick up new ones as well. (Soap making, wood working, painting) I am the type to dedicate myself fully to my partner while losing myself/identity (not healthy, working on it). 

We broke up about 2 years ago, well, I got dumped I mean. So I found myself alone and find myself digging deeper into the comfortable introvert hole I dug for myself. A lot of my friends from home (Chicago based) are pc gamers and it has been easy to maintain a connection.

I had a ray of health issues (physical and mental). I have been doing really well lately and find myself wanting to reach out of my comfortable zone.

I used to love playing basketball and being competitive (friendly competition). 

I used to weight lift and be fairly active. I like to consider myself as an athletic nerd like Henry Cavill bahaha jk due to many many reasons haha, my health declined (rollercoaster really) and gained tons of weight in the last 5 years. I always tried to pick myself up and start over with good daily habits then my physical health would decline again and being an emotional eater also doesn't help.

I don't know what I am asking for or why I am posting. Maybe to reach out to make friends, lifting/gym buddies, or motivation/encouragment to continue making good habits.

I don't drink, bit of a nerd, but also like to play sports. I am 35 asian male (if it matters? Idk lol)

Being straight, I haven't exactly been searching for men, but I've never encountered a lack of single men.

I take it that you don't use dating apps because I struggle to imagine that this would be your experience if you did. Is this correct? If you don't like dating apps, that's totally fine, but then I have another question.

"There's a greater Asian population up here than outlanders realize, but it's not the same as on the coasts or in the south. Think Lao/Thai/Hmong rather than Chinese/Japanese. There's plenty of opportunities for boba.

As others have said, food here is way better than a small city should expect to have, and legitimately great at times regardless of city size. Up until recently Madison had as many James Beard winners as Austin. It's still close, 4 to 3 for Best Chef in our respective regions. Sadly, we don't have a native barbecue culture here, but you'll find some okay spots here and there. Just manage your expectations.

Housing is rough here like it is everywhere. Don't expect a cakewalk to buy a house unless you're rolling in it. (Money, not cake, although if you've got enough cake to roll in, let's talk.)

It's cold, make sure you have a good coat -- just a good one, doesn't have to be Arctic Explorer-level -- and invest in quality mittens/hats/boots. Keep the extremities warm. Don't let anyone panic you into getting snow tires; as with all movement in inclement weather, just be patient and predictable to those around you, and you'll be fine.

"So, here are some ideas that might help you find your footing around what you're looking for so you feel more established and find a good community which might inform where you ultimately decide to settle down:

1. Look at Madison 365 (https://madison365.com/) &amp; Capital City Hues (https://www.capitalcityhues.com/). These groups totally exist here, I feel like Madison is pretty well integrated (someone call my shit if I'm wrong) so it's about finding these spaces that have been carved out. Hopefully these couples with my earlier recommendation will help you meet people in the community that can help filling out what you're looking for.

2. You've probably heard of State Street at this point, that is drunk college kid territory. It's still cool, but big young vibe. Lots of bars, shops, etc. Personally calling out ""Le C's Patisserie &amp; Tea House"" because I love boba. However, it's very much cute shops, lots of bars and food, lively on the weekend area, but also drunk college kids everywhere. That's the area for that.

3. You have the Isthmus -- this is where you're going to have access to Lake Medota and Monona, there are often things happening along these places, lots of activities and biking, kayaking, etc. You can rent kayaks along the shore at Brittingham if ye want, but actually I know over by Olbrich there is a place too (can't remember).  Also, for music, art, etc you're gonna be looking in this area too.

5. There's a few different places AROUND Madison that are cool too. Go to the Glarner Stube and get the Rosti potatoes \*\_\_\*. The town is a ""Little Sweden"", and is cool, you can get ice cream by the water and walk along some of the nearby trails as well. It's a fun little spot.

6. The East Side and Middleton (weirdly, someone correct me if I'm wrong) have a pretty big LBTQ community, so you can look in those areas for information about what's going on. 

7. Weird plug; look up ""Bipoc Birding Club of WI"". 

8. Don't sleep on your local public library, they usually have lots of good resources and community goings on (at least mine does).

Is there anything you are interested in specifically? Hopefully the above will get you pointed in some places. Welcome to Madison! There's something for everyone here I assure you, but it takes a bit more work to seek out.",reddit,downtown

"Need to move. Looking for local recommendations. I have lived in Illinois suburbs all my life. After a particularly bad set of weeks with my dad, I had opted to fully move. My aunt was able to house me for a bit, then my brother, then my sister. Now I am at a house owned by an acquaintance from school. They plan on selling in the first half of 2025.

I have been working another county with an online friend and I make about 8k a year. Originally, my plan was to move to Minnesota and more specifically St Paul. If possible, I want to live somewhere heavily walkable, where I never need to use my car again.

I have considered Madison due to its reputation as a city with high walkability and bikeability, as well as it being from what I can tell, relatively progressive, and decently affordable. I found one place that was $40k to own, and two places to rent, one of which being $120, and the other being $550.

As is, my roommates 2 huskies make it hard for me to even breath downstairs, and if possible, I may want to transfer to fully online classes in the near future and move sooner than later.

I often like to look at different cities and document different restaurants or museums within the area. In some, I also mark places to live or potential jobs. A few that stand out to me that I've found so far are places like insomnia cookies, poke up, and the monona terrace. I am curious if there are any recommended places to check out, or recommendations for people moving to the city.

I have also seen places like the orange shoe gym, which interest me as it is not only in walking distance, but seemingly not too expensive as far as gyms go. I am by no means an avid gym goer, but I want to get in shape.",reddit,monona

I visit and love all the bookstores we have in our area. But this is my main book place. This is where I feed my book buying addiction more than any other place.

* Ink Cap Books
   * location: Down in stoughton, but worth the visit.
   * Why I love it? They do so many fun little events, and another place where the curation is amazing. So many browsable books. The vibe of the place is just wonderful.  They haven't been open all that long, and they just keep getting better and better. 
   * Seating/Cafe? Not inside, unless there's an event (every event I've gone to was fun though). I'd recommend getting a book and taking it a couple blocks down tot he cidery though. 
* Kismet Books
   * location: Verona (that's west side, right?)

It's how they make most of their money. People actually working out costs them money, people worrying a check and never showing up are the ones they want. I think your best bet is to act like you moved far away, but you could always try calling and explaining your situation.

"How is the YMCA of Dane County Able to Get Away With Paying Such Atrociously Low Wages? I'm a member at the Y and thought about working there part time, so I asked some of the employees there what they made, and I couldn't believe how incredibly low the wages were.

I know that the YMCA is a non-profit, but they've been spending hundreds of thousands on new gym equipment, and hundreds of thousands more on remodeling, yet they only pay their gym staff $12/hr? That's nuts! Planet fitness is only $10/mo for a membership, and even they start their gym staff at $13.50/hr (still pretty damned low). The Y charges $53/mo for an adult membership.

I spoke to a staff member in their child watch area, and he's been working there for 15 years and only makes $12.50/hr! That's a starvation wage! How can an organization claim to care about the community, yet they don't even care about their own staff? The lifeguards used to start at $13/hr, but they were having to close the pool since they didn't have enough guards to cover, so they finally just bumped up that job to $16/hr.

The website used to list their wages, but they don't anymore, because they probably know that they won't be able to attract applicants if they show their terrible wages up front.

I've worked for non-profits that pay a lot better than the Y, so being a non-profit isn't an excuse.",reddit,general madison

"Pinball League Starting this Sunday Hey everyone! I wanted to call out a fun pinball league that’s starting at the Kickback Bar in Middleton (the first store in the new Middleton Market!) this Sunday.

Every second Sunday of the month starting at noon (first meeting is in two days) the Kickback is hosting a Pin-Golf league. Pin-Golf is a fun pinball tournament format where you play a pinball machine trying to get a target score -- you score a ""hole in one"" if you get that score in 1 ball, 2 strokes if you get it in 2, 3 strokes if you get it in 3, and there are bogey scores if you fall below the target score. A league session consists of 9 holes/machines.

Seasons are 6 months/sessions long, and your top 4 out of 6 performances count, so you can feasibly miss 2 outings and still be competitive in the standings. There's a head-to-head finals in brackets based on the qualifying season in June.

It's super laid back, and one awesome benefit of Pin-Golf is you can choose who you're paired with, so if you already like pinball and want to introduce it to a friend or family member, we can ensure you play your 9 holes together. If you are new to pinball yourself, the community is very open and inviting and will help you get up to speed. I'm personally happy to take any and all questions about pinball or the format. 

Sincerely — if you’re reading this and you’re currently thinking “What? They still make pinball?” — there’s an incredible hobby and community in this city that’s just waiting for you. Just let me know if you need any help or push to get involved.

There's only 49 spots available and over half are filled, so if you're interested sign up here: https://thekickback.bar/craft-beer-pinball-league-wisconsin-pin-golf-kickback9-tour/",reddit,middleton

"Straight people are welcome in gay bars but... ... you need to understand the space you're walking into.

This isn't about excluding straight people. It's about asking for basic respect when you enter a space that wasn't made with you in mind. Gay bars exist because, for a long time, they were some of the only places queer people could feel safe, let loose, and be fully ourselves. That history still matters — even if the neighborhood feels more ""accepting"" now than it did decades ago.

So yes, you're welcome if you’re showing up with the right attitude. That means you’re not treating the bar like a zoo or a novelty. You’re not filming people without consent or loudly gawking at drag queens. You’re not dominating the space with big groups who aren’t there to engage respectfully. You’re a guest, and you act like one.

And if you’re the guy who bragged about going to gay bars just to get free drinks from men you have no intention of engaging with (lol wtf?) you’re not being clever. You’re being exploitative. That’s not allyship, it’s manipulation, and it’s exactly the kind of behavior that makes people feel unsafe or taken advantage of in their own space.

Also, to the person comparing this to ""whites excluding Black people from bars"" (again, wtf?) that’s a completely absurd and offensive take. This isn’t about systemic oppression. Queer people creating and protecting their own spaces isn’t remotely the same as historically privileged groups using power to exclude others. Don’t weaponize the language of oppression to defend your entitlement to every space that exists.

At the same time, we also need to be honest that not all ""queer spaces"" feel welcoming to everyone in the community. If trans folks, femmes, or anyone who doesn’t fit a certain mold are getting side-eyed or pushed out, that’s a problem too. A space can't claim to be for the LGBTQ+ community if it only makes one part of that community feel comfortable.

So if you're straight and want to support us that's great! Just know what you’re walking into. And if you’re queer and frustrated by the current scene know that you're not alone. We can want better for our spaces while still protecting what they were meant to be.

Queer spaces only work when everyone understands their role in keeping them that way.",reddit,general madison

"Advice on Proposal Photography Hey all, 

Planning on proposing to my SO in a few weeks. I’ve seen similar threads so apologies for the repeat thread but I’m curious about hiring a proposal photographer. 

I’ve done some research and I see a lot of engagement and wedding photographers but what I’m not seeing is photographers for the proposal specifically. 

Obviously I want to pay someone for their time appropriately so definitely not looking to cheap out but a common theme from my research is that it’s going to be quite a bit of money for what ultimately is going to be a 15 minute event. 

The tricky part is I don’t know anyone personally who I can just hand a DSLR camera to, to take the pictures for us. I’ve thought about hiding a friend near by with an iPhone but given my SO is a photographer themself who has taken many proposal photos for our friends, I suspect the bar is a bit higher in terms of quality. 

In summary I’m looking for either advice on anyone’s experiences and how they approached this, or recommendations for a photographer.",reddit,general madison

Fun fact, if you prepay and select your fuel type, the gas will start pumping! Who knew?!

I was born in LA and grew up in Israel. Been around in last years, lived in Seattle and Cambridge MA, and spent a month in New York and some time in California. Now I fly out of Israel to Seattle, and I wanted to open my mind for other options for relocation.

Madison seems like a super nice city, pretty safe, with lots of nature trails and winter and summer outdoor activities, plus diversity of people. The price is reasonable, I saw some really pretty apartments for 1,400$ a month, which is a great price for me (Seattle is around 2000$). Another option in the lake region I considered and might visit is Ann Arbor.

Just wanted to see what is the great things about the city, and chat directly with people in town! I also like spending time in the gym, reading, science, philosophical conversations and nature photography. Thought of opening a book club and/or a photography club where I'll go or join one.

"&gt;All you've said is that if people lose the money that's the judge's fault

Yes, exactly. In spite of your alleged credentials and authority, and in spite of my ever-increasing clarity around my points, you continually fail to engage with them whatsoever. So I am not even going into the evidence because you won't take the first step with me.

Bail is designed to consider risk and ability to pay, therefore, if someone breaks the conditions surrounding their release (such as by fleeing the jurisdiction), then the judge failed to assess the risk of the person leaving because the bail amount was too low. Does that make more sense now, or will I have to repeat myself again?

&gt;Asserting over and over that bail serves a purpose when I've already asked for evidence is not explaining anything.

Because you still don't understand the purpose of bail. How can you assess evidence of its effectiveness if you still struggle to grasp the goal? You would either be confused by the evidence I provide, or you would dismiss it and assert that you have imagined a different purpose for bail to serve.

&gt;The OP literally put a news article in the thread which goes into detail about how setting bail sets up people for ""jumping bail"" charges, for things as simple as walking into a bar.

Sounds like a bad reference, then. I'm glad I could make you engage with something here. Anyway, what exactly is the harm of banning someone from bars as a condition? Especially if their crime is related to drunkeness. Failing to abide by such a simple condition (assuming the alleged criminal doesn't work at a bar) proves that they probably can't handle being back in the world just yet.",reddit,general madison

Should I pair any other CS/Math courses with this combo? If so, are there any recommended classes given the workload from these two?

"Seen a number of good posts and support on here, with others admittedly less so. At the end of the just getting the process started, or any process rather, is the way to go.

I was once in the same boat as you, so I know how it goes. Spent 3 years at University of Iowa, but battled insomnia and depression through that for the most of it for various reasons. Eventually dropped out with only a single year of credits and move back in with the parents. Thankfully had that support which allowed me to pay off my loans working at some shitty $10/hr job. I actually went back to school at 25 and graduated at 27 with a programming degree. I’m now 34 and with all loans paid off and comfortable enough income to not stress out everything. While I’m not wanting to steal your post, I simply want to share that I know what you’re going through. With the exception of parental support, our scenarios are eerily similar, so I know you can come out on top. You simply need to get the ball rolling in any given direction. 

As someone else suggested earlier, highly recommend the bartending gig as an option. I currently work a second job as a bartender, albeit only 2-3 times a month at a music venue. However, that 2-3 times a month still nets me $700-800 or more in liquid cash for various expenses.

Is plasma still an option for you? I know a lot of plasma companies still pay $400-500/month if donating the whole month.

You can find a lot of good deals on electronics, computer chairs, etc. on local online marketplaces (like FB) to flip various items for profit. We occasionally flip Herman Miller Aerons when people sell for super cheap cause they don’t know what they have. Often make a $300+ profit on those.

Additionally, what type of car are you driving that you’re having car payments to make? Can you downsize to a different vehicle? Say, make a trade with someone via FB Marketplace where they pay cash on top? You may easily be able to acquire the missing $2,000 there.

Finally, if/when reapplying for school BE SURE TO FILL OUT TBE FAFSA. Reapplying at 25 with minimal income allowed me to entirely maximize the government grants, getting between $15-20k to pay for returning to school.

Best of luck to you and sincerely hope the road ahead is lighter.",reddit,campus

"Is it though? 34 different districts, when most residential neighborhoods are a handful, isn't evidence that it is overly restrictive. Are setbacks from lot lines overly restrictive? If you allow businesses in residential neighborhoods without restrictions, you don't automatically get cool corner stores and dive bars, you get fast food restaurants and car washes. Look at all the high density buildings being built and the neighborhood opposition to some of them. Not having zoning would open up for some terrible individual (selfish) decisions, often by investors that don't live in the neighborhoods they change, and pit people against each other. While I am strongly for more housing, I think with many people opposed to change, the current process and pace is actually pretty good.

In general, I think regulations become complex because of people (especially investors) trying to cheat or evade the rules for their own selfish benefit, and the regulations try to keep up. When you first view complex regulations, it is common to want them to be simplified, without knowing the backstory that led to the complexity. I think there's ample evidence that neighborhoods need common rules to avoid conflict between neighbors and absolutely terrible developments that are obviously bad for the neighborhood.

The council has been pretty fast to revise the zoning ordinances for tiny homes over the past few years. At this point, they are allowed. Why are you saying they are ""outright banned""?  

While it has been frustrating for many, there has been a lot of mixed use, high density housing built. The transformation on the west wash side has been stunning.  And much of this has been mixed use and high density. By saying it is 'banned', I don't know what you mean? The ""complex approval process"" looks at things like rain water management, which for big developments in flood prone areas (i.e. an isthmus) is very important. 

I wonder if lax rules that have allowed for sprawl at the edges of the city has been a bigger issue in the lack of housing?",reddit,isthmus

"Gym recommendations? My spouse is into powerlifting and pays for me and him to have a gym membership at a powerlifting gym in the area. Obviously, I love that he does that for me and encourages me to be active. The problem with my current set up- I don't do weight training myself and to do exercise I enjoy, that entails cardio machines. This particular gym has been under construction the entire year I've been going there. The intention, I was told, is for cardio machines to be on a second level of the facility but in this year, I've been going and trying to be patient, they have been sort of randomly moved throughout the gym and half the time many aren't even plugged in. The others are largely out of order. That has left me with 1 stair master and 1 treadmill I like to use for my workouts and on more than one occasion, other members have used them, and I have had no machines to use for a large portion of the time I budgeted to be there. It's also one that plays very loud music that's sometimes quite misogynistic and a gym where some people very loudly slam their plates - both of which has sometimes resulted in panic attacks for me at this gym. My favorite thing to do when working out used to be the elliptical but at this gym, they've been out of order or in a location that is inaccessible (crammed up against a wall) for the entirety of this year I've been going. When I inquired, they claimed they'd move them to an accessible area within a few weeks and they still are not accessible. As a result of all these things, I often don't want to go there. It's hard to predict that I can even use the gym the way I want to when so few of machines are available to begin with for me. I'm considering buying my own membership elsewhere, but it looks like I'll be paying at least $60 or more a month to do this. Is this reasonable? For me, it sounds like a lot of money but then again, I've never paid my own membership before. Husband's the one who is helping me get active so it's fun to go together sometimes and it's great not having to pay anything, but I think the unpredictability could be a barrier to me sticking to an exercise plan. Wondering if anyone has advice or has been in a similar position? Any gym recommendations?

"How much of a pain is snow and how far out should I get a job from my dorm?    So this is kind of a commuting question. I’m from the southern part of the US and deal more with tropical storms and extreme heat rather than snow.

   Only problem is that there is nothing that fits those criteria within a 10 min walk of my dorm (or not too many jobs in general).

How often are blizzards a problem?

Southeast:
Common freshman dorms on the Southeast side of campus include:
- Ogg
- Sellery
- Witte
- Chadbourne
- Barnard
- Smith
There are pros and cons to living in the Southeast area, and each dorm is known for having a specific set of unique cultural and social norms. In general, these dorms are in a really good location for freshmen- nearly all of {x} ’s general ed. classes will be near the Southeast area.

1.Witte and 2.Sellery are by far the noisiest, and most rambunctious dorms on campus. If you’re okay with the noise and general level of chaos, the actual rooms and facilities are pretty new and generally pretty nice- but they do tend to get trashed a lot. The majority of people who live in Witte and Sellery will be kids who are involved in Greek Life, due to the proximity of the dorms to Langdon Street (frat row). Basically every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday are when frats have events, so these will be the busiest and most hectic times in these dorms. I’d advise against these dorms if you aren’t planning on rushing, or you like a more quiet environment. Witte has a bus stop in front of it that connects to the main campus loop- super handy!

3.Ogg is slightly less wild than Sellery and Witte, but still heavily influenced and involved with Greek life events. It’s the closest dorm to both the main dining hall for freshmen and the gym- so the location is really top notch! It also has a bus stop for the main campus route- so {x}  would always have a pretty easy time making it to class. I lived here and personally disliked the ruckus, but loved the location.

4.Chadbourne/Barnard has a few cool features. It’s the closest to the waterfront and the student union, as well as multiple libraries- perfect for easy studying or meeting up with friends at the Union. The rooms are infamously small, and the building is rather old, but it’s more than adequate. Another great feature in this dorm is the dining hall that’s on the first floor. In my opinion, the food there is a lot better than the food at Gordon. This dorm is also a little more calm, and less involved with Greek life culture in general. Barnard is right next to Chadbourne, and shares the dining hall and general location.
   
 5.Smith is definitely one of the nicest of all the dorms- it’s very new, and actually has a Starbucks on the first floor. The rooms are generally specious and clean, and it’s around the same level of general craziness as Ogg is. There will be both noisy and quiet days in this dorm. It’s also right next to the gym, and has basketball courts out front- which are cool- but in my experience, REALLY LOUD! Overall though, really cool dorm.

Lakeshore

Common freshman dorms on the Lakeshore side of campus include:
- Waters
- Dejope
- Slichter
- Phillips
- Sullivan
- Cole
- Humphrey
- Adams
In general, Lakeshore dorms are quieter and less involved with Greek Life. However, the buildings tend to be on the older side, and the location is slightly inconvenient for getting to the classes {x}  will likely be taking in his first year.

6.Waters is a small dorm right on the edge of the main hub of campus- and right above the Lakeshore path. The location is gorgeous, and they do have a small dining hall inside of this dorm ( although it is sporadically open, apparently ). This dorm is on the quieter side, and it’s between two gyms- meaning that you will have to walk a little bit to access either of them. The rooms are on the older side- and I’m not sure that this one has air conditioning. It’s definitely quiet, and the location is scenic but not geographically very advantageous in relation to the classes {x} will likely be attending.

7.Dejope is the dorm that I really wish I had lived in when I was a freshman. It is an absolutely stunning building, has a great dining hall on the first floor, and the rooms are spacious, clean and really new. It’s right next to one of the lakefronts, and you’ll see lots of kids outside having bonfires or laying on hammocks when the weather is nice. It’s also right next to Bakke, which is the brand new gym. Bakke is worth living here in itself- it boasts four levels of equipment, a gaming room, a climbing wall, a pool, two outdoor workout spaces, a skating rink, and a teaching kitchen (among other things). However, I’ll admit that the location of Dejope isn’t great. It’s at least a 15-20 minute walk from most classes that {x}  will be taking. There is, however, a bus stop right outside the building to make the trip a little easier. There’s also a lot of outdoor space- including soccer fields and sand volleyball courts- which are basically always full of kiddos.

8.Adams, 9.Slichter, 10.Humphrey, 11.Cole, 12.Sullivan, 13.Phillips
These dorms are in the same general area, and relatively similar. They are all in beautiful and scenic locations on campus, and are right next to the lake and lots of walking trails. The buildings tend to be on the older side, and many of these buildings do not have air conditioning. It’s unlikely that there will be a lot of partying or noise in these buildings, or a strong connection to Greek Life events. The locations of these dorms are suboptimal in terms of proximity to classes, but they are all near accessible bus stops. There is a small dining hall nearby these dorms-called Carson’s- that’s pretty good and very cute. Overall, they are beautiful and have a lot of character- but not really close to anything in particular.


General Notes

When touring campus, I would recommend starting at the Memorial Union(14). Check out the several restaurants and student service available in the building. There’s a beautiful outdoor space you can access by going around the building, or through the building through the work area past Strada. I’d recommend looking at the terrace area- and checking out the docks. From here, head over to the library mall. It’s towards Ogg. This is the epicenter of multiple libraries, and one of the major hearts of campus. When standing by the water fountain in the center of the mall and facing the memorial union, The Red Gym (15) will be at about 2’ o'clock. This building is one of the oldest, and nicknamed “ Bowser’s Castle”. It’s mainly an equity resource center now, but one of the prettiest buildings on campus. Directly to your left is the Wisconsin Historical Society ( 16) . If it’s open, I would HIGHLY recommend going in and heading upstairs to the second floor reading room. Lots of people call it the “Harry Potter” library- it looks straight out of a movie. To your right is the Memorial Library (17) - visitors cannot enter without special permissions- but it’s interesting to know about and it’s one of my favorite cozy study spots. The last library in this area is College library (18) - which you can find by heading towards the red building marked “Science Hall (19)” and looking right. If you turn around and face away from Memorial Union, you’ll see Mosse Humanities Building (20)- it’s a huge concrete block. {x}  will definitely have some of his freshman classes there.
From here, I would head up Bascom Hill towards Bascom Hall (21). On either side, you can see some of the oldest buildings on campus. The education building and the law library are some of my favorite study spots. Lincoln is at the top of the hill - touch his shoes for good luck- it’s what we all do on exam days! To the left of Lincoln, you’ll see a tall tower by a smaller building. This is Sewall Social Sciences (22), another spot {x}  will certainly have class.
Go down the stairs to the left of Bascom Hall, and head down the road leading to the construction area. Here, head into the Discovery Building (23). It’s a building with an indoor garden that’s a replication of plant life in the age of the dinosaurs! Very cool and a great spot to study. From here, head to Union South(24). It’s the second student union on campus and has some more cool restaurants and student resources. I’d recommend stopping for an ice cream break here!
From this point, head up the road towards Southeast, and check out some of the buildings on the side. You’ll pass the Computer Science building (25), the Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences building(26), and the Geology Building(27)! If it’s open, there’s a fantastic free museum in the geology building that I have visited multiple times.
If you head up this road, you’ll end up with Ogg at your right, back in Southeast. The last thing that is definitely worth checking out is the Chazen art museum, directly left from Ogg. Swing up to Witte, and then cut back into the Gordon lawn to head to the museum to see both of them.

So I really worked on myself and read books and listened to podcasts on dating and it helped immensely as far as knowing what women are looking for and being more confident in myself.

Unfortunately I know this is rare and a lot of guys aren't as self reflective and honest with themselves. But one of the biggest pieces of advice I took from everything is that dating is a numbers game, and even more so for women. 

I know it sucks and it gets old, but I promise you'll find a good match eventually when you least expect it, women just have to sort through more trash to find it than guys do. I found mine at 38 and feel very lucky I did. We met on Bumble btw

I wouldn't totally give up on online dating, but maybe make them quicker and just start with a coffee or drink at a bar just to see if there's even any chemistry, to limit them from wasting your time. Don't let them plan a bunch of activities or even dinner, for a first date.

As far as other ideas, signing up for group activities on the MeetUP app could have some potential. At the very least, you're hopefully doing something you enjoy and maybe make new friends, who could maybe hook you up with their single friends haha.

"I went in to kill time before an appointment and I was so excited about the architecture.  Coffee was good, creamer station, add-ons, condiments, napkins and drinking water well stocked, and even the water glasses were beautiful and visually interesting.  

I didn't realize the beautiful old bank building it's in still houses a functioning bank, though.  The lovely atmosphere was ruined by a bunch of bankers having a team meeting.  The last things I want to think about when I'm trying to relax somewhere are work, corperate buzzwords, and money.  I guess I can't fault the building for sticking to its original function, but that's what took it from ""potential new regular spot"" to ""no need to go out of the way to come back.""

It could still be a great place for people who aren't bothered by stuff like that or can tune it out.  I'm sure being in the bank's lobby is why the place has such limited hours and no weekends, too.",reddit,general madison

"Update: thank you for trialing our business! Some of you may have seen our post a couple of months ago where we were looking for people to trial our business, for those who didn't here's a quick rundown. A friend and I thought it would be cool if you could turn any photo you want into a paint by numbers kit. That way you can paint your dog, cat, partner, the whole family or whatever you want without having to be an artist.

We looked up the idea and found that the current stores in the market were ridiculously expensive or only offered kits without a frame or with a DIY frame (who wants to put together their own frame? Don't you just want to open the box and start painting). So we looked around and talked to a bunch of suppliers and eventually we were able to produce custom paint by number kits cheaper then anywhere else and already framed.

We reached out to you here on Reddit asking you to test them out at cost price and we've received some amazing feedback as a result. Thank you if you were one of our OG customers! We want to continue to grow and get more feedback and reviews though so we're re-opening the offer in case you missed it the first time around or you want to order some more kits.

You can use the code ""COSTPRICEREDDIT"" to get our kits for cost price (our margins are pretty slim right now, we want to be as affordable as possible). You can get up to 4 kits at that price so feel free to buy a few and plan a date night, family activity or just get your Christmas shopping done early. If you've already ordered with that code it has no been reset so you can get the deal again!

We look forward to getting more feedback and hopefully you'll love our kits enough to spread the word to your family and friends!

"I hate weekends I am sorry for the vent but it is 3am and I am hoping that writing it out will make me feel at least a bit better. 

I am a junior transfer in Engineering and I’ve had a really hard time making friends, but that’s easier to ignore during the week when I have classes to go to and homework to do, etc. But during the weekends when I cannot go home there is nothing to distract me from the fact that I can go days without talking to anyone besides my parents. I just really hate these weekend days where I stay in bed till like 4pm because I don’t have class or anything to get out of bed for. I’m fully self aware that if I wanted to feel as depressed as possible that’s literally what I would do too 💀 I just don’t know how to get out of this cycle 

Feeling isolated is mostly my fault and I recognize that, I just don’t have the mental bandwidth to try any clubs or go to social events. I’ve tried that at the beginning of each fall semester I’ve been in college, but as soon as that first round of midterms hits (usually before) any motivation I had to try and get a life fizzles out and I’m on survival mode trying to balance engineering and being premed. 

I have been part of study groups in my classes before- they’re not survivable without them sometimes- but I seem to be the type of person that people are not interested in passing the barrier from acquaintances to friends with. It’s very discouraging being the person that always reaches out first to ask if the other wants to study together. At this point having someone reach out to me instead and ask if I wanted to get matcha at Aldo’s cafe together or something would make my entire month. 

I also got diagnosed with autism this week so that answers the question of why I am not doing the best in the social department. I did make one friend this semester since we work together, and it was amazing while it lasted, but she recently ghosted me out of the blue. I’ve been finding it really difficult to put all these feelings back into the box where they were before I experienced how much better college (especially weekends) can be when you can go through it with a friend. Its like when I got glasses as a kid and I could see the leaves on trees, but now I’m stuck with blurry vision again and I know exactly what I’m missing out on which makes it 100x worse

Idk what this even was I’m just tired of my own company 😭 did make me feel better though so mission accomplished. Time to watch some House MD 💯💯",reddit,general madison

"Having lived in both places, Seattle is much more diverse overall, but there is a large international student presence on campus here in Madison, many of whom are asian.  Both cities are very safe, but also you do need to practice basic safety when walking alone in the dark, especially if you are femme.  

As for the cold - one adjusts.  And really winters are not nearly as bad as they used to be... it's just a few really cold days, nowhere near as much snow as we had when I was a kid (I am a geezer of a returning student and an 80s kid).  Mid-40s F and drizzling isn't exactly pleasant, either, and that's Seattle for like 6 months of the year.  In winter the city will get 3 weeks to a month solid of absolutely zero sun.  This takes its own toll!  

I will also say I moved out there in 2004, and the Amazon boom has really changed the city a lot.  Previously the Microsoft tech bros were all over on the east side of the lake, in Kirkland, Redmond, Bothell, etc, but with Amazon being downtown, they're everywhere in Seattle proper, and the city is a lot more.... corporate feeling than it was 20 years ago.  So if you're looking for something more quirky, Madison might be better.  If you want that bigger city feel, Seattle is where it's at.  

Feel free to ask more specific questions since I have lived both places, and still visit Seattle fairly regularly to visit my found family (I was out there for over a decade).  I just can't speak to journalism specific stuff, since I went to art school in Seattle and am now STEM at Madison.",reddit,downtown

"As a student with a disability who has worked with the McBurney Center, my experience at UW was poor. For a university with some great disability studies professors, it was so deeply disappointing to discover how isolated and ignored disabled people still are there. Read the book “Academic Ablism” and just know that UW is one of the worst offenders. Everything is by the book, near totally disbelieved until medical documentation is shown. Nearly every professor is suspicious and skeptical of accommodation, unforgiving about being late, unaccommodating except for the minimum they are required to accept, and they begrudge even that. Buildings are poorly retrofit to accommodate, especially in those departments that make less income off students like the literature department. It does depend on what department your student wants to be part of, simply as a function of where they are located. But also on how these departments understand disability. Far too many at UW-Madison are in the “charity case” mindset. Helpful up and until the moment you are an inconvenience for too long. You’re especially in trouble if you are outspoken in ways faculty, administrators, and the popular wealthy kids don’t like. Each of those groups represent a different kind of problem. 

That’s not to say other universities are much better, but I could think of a few. Universities in major cities tend to be a little better. Less elitist schools, too. 

I don’t mean to say your student won’t be successful or even find their place at UW. I know many of my disabled peers who have thrived and found their callings at UW. But it’s rarely because the university was helpful as a whole. Their success is despite the eugenic infrastructure of this institution. It’s well past time for them to have a wake up call. 

Many at the McBurney Center try to do what they can, but they fold far too soon against institutional pressures. A lot of good talk, little actual attention to making the lived experience less damn difficult. Harder than it needs to be, and I don’t mean that in an academic sense.",reddit,campus
"Have a set list of apartments that you want to tour and may want to sign ASAP.

Create a list of your needs such as…
Do I have enough money to cover rent, utilities, food, etc.

Does this apartment have what I want? Fully furnished? All utilities included? Is the apartment by the bed pricing or by the unit pricing? Is it close to campus, etc etc.

Look into apartments and when they open leasing, most if not all apartments in Madison open leasing in October, but there are some apartments hidden around that don’t open leasing until later in the academic year. So keep that in mind.

Call and ask stupid questions if you need too, of course some apartment websites, will list out information. But sometimes the information on the websites can be vague at times, so it doesn’t hurt to ask and clarify.

When you tour apartments, have a set list of question you’ll want to ask! Such as, does the apartment allow holes in the wall, if not what are the rules of hanging stuff up, does it need renters insurance, noise level, where do packages go.

"I've said it before and I'll say it again:

What should we be using instead of Workday? PeopleSoft has some pretty major limitations, UDDS has been propped up with workarounds on top of workarounds for decades, and our financial organization is fractured, with different departments effectively being siloed off and making reconciliation take far longer than it should. (And it's not just the inter-departmental funny money charges creating these accounting headaches.)

I certainly have bones to pick with the ATP folks over how they ignored feedback on the Sup Org hierarchy and the MBA-driven development going on in the Finance side. Admittedly, UDDS's limitations and the ways it's been propped up make a 1:1 mapping impossible, so some use cases just can't be satisfied nicely, but the way they clobbered together the UW Org Structure to try and address these problems last minute (using the Cost Center Hierarchy and now also the Sup Org hierarchy!) has been ridiculous and caused no end of headaches, especially since they replicated some of the same problems with the Sup Org hierarchy and then tried to pave over it by introducing *person-level* Org Structures (which, yes, it seems to have finally satisfied every outstanding UDDS use case, but these are manually maintained since they're not attached to positions or derived automatically from position data...feels a bit fragile if you ask me).

All that to say, I'm not sure what we should be doing. I've only ever dealt with Workday, Banner, and HCM, and they each suck in their own ways (though HCM, or at least UW's implementation of it, may be the worst of the three). And any major changeover like this is going to involve a *lot* of downstream changes and dress rehearsals to ensure the chaos during cutover is contained, which inevitably leads to admin bloat.

&gt; With ongoing chaos in the federal government and UW staring down huge budget shortfalls, it hardly needs to be said that UW couldn't have chosen a more foolish time to try overhauling its legacy data systems.

We have been working and preparing for this transition for ***OVER FOUR YEARS***. The reason it kept getting delayed was because it takes a LONG fucking time to migrate the *THOUSANDS* of systems which (directly or indirectly) depend on HRS data. This wasn't a spur of the moment decision! A Trump 2024 victory may have been foreseeable back in 2021, but what wasn't was the sledgehammer he's currently taking to higher ed. By your logic, we should never do any long-term planning because what if a bull gets let loose in the china shop?

And this is also a UW-System initiative. We (Madison) aren't burning all our tuition dollars for this. If anything, this will make a lot of oddball HR situations easier since the whole UW will be under one system, rather than having Madison doing its own thing.

So my questions for you:

* What tenant have you been trialing? Wisc7? Wisc10? Wisc11? If you're an employee, you have access to at least 1 right now (wisc6) and can play around with it. What are your thoughts on it?

* Let's say we abandon Workday pre-emptively. One of the major things Workday will allow us to do is track retirees, as people are evicted from HRS 2 years after their termination date. Currently, Madison tracks these people via SpecAuth, but Madison is the only campus to do this because it's tied into our HRS, and again, Madison HRS does its own thing. Tracking retirees in HRS just sucks, so the only attempt that has been made was by Parkside, and they gave up after entering 3 people. UW wants to track these people, it's just way harder than it should be. So what are all the other systems supposed to do if we stick with PeopleSoft?

* What should we be using instead of Workday?

* Why did you create a burner account just for this?

If it goes to shit, yes, it will fucking suck. We're trying to prevent that, but there will always be bumps in the road for something this large. But I've only ever heard people say ""we shouldn't do this,"" never ""this is what we should be doing."" Please provide some constructive criticism so that if we do have to give up on Workday, we'll have alternatives to look into.",reddit,campus

"Here’s an explaination sent out by Chancellor Mnookin:   

“Dear Campus Community,  

As you may be aware, this morning around 7 a.m., the University of Wisconsin Police Department (UWPD), in concert with partner law enforcement agencies and with my authorization, cleared the unlawful tent encampment on Library Mall. Over the last few days, we have repeatedly asked the protesters to bring their demonstration into conformity with the law that prohibits camping on UW grounds. They declined to do so.  This morning, those present at the encampment were given several warnings during which time they were offered the opportunity to peacefully leave the encampment with their belongings and avoid being either cited or arrested. These warnings followed prior communications, including two messages from campus leaders, that clearly delineated the expectation of consequences if the encampment was not removed.  We appreciate that many protesters chose the option of avoiding legal consequences in exchange for removing tents and other camping supplies from campus grounds. A set of individuals, including some faculty and staff, obstructed law enforcement efforts to remove the tents and were cited.  To repeat: Every individual was given the opportunity to move away from the tent area and continue peaceful protest without further police engagement. While many chose to do so, approximately 30 protesters were cited and several others resisted police action to remove tents or otherwise interfered with the operation and were arrested. There is a good deal of conversation on social media about this operation, some of it inaccurate. Here is the UWPD overview of the operation. UWPD will continue to monitor for illegal activity.  I cannot emphasize strongly enough our support for free expression and peaceful protest. Now that the illegal activity has been resolved, students and others are free to resume peaceful protest that abides by campus protest guidelines today or at any time in the future. Our operation focused only on the tents and the encampment, which constituted the only prohibited activity under Chapter 18 of the UW System Administrative Code.  I also recognize that it is deeply felt pain and horror about the tragic and devastating loss of life and scale of destruction in Gaza that has fueled some of our community members’ desire to protest in ways that go beyond what is legal and permissible. UW–Madison has a long and proud history of fighting for deeply felt causes and exercising our right to free expression. Civil disobedience has been a time-honored tradition in our nation, including here. Yet it is a long-standing element of the civil disobedience tradition to respect the laws we share and to accept that there are consequences for violating them. It is this that distinguishes civil disobedience from mere lawlessness.  Further, I take very seriously the trust that is placed in me to help protect the safety of our campus community. While the gathering on Library Mall this week had been largely peaceful, we have witnessed disturbing accounts of people not affiliated with the campus coming into the area, attracted by the encampment, and engaging in confrontational and other inciteful behaviors. Such an increased risk to the safety of our community, which would be expected to grow over time, was a significant contributing factor to today’s action to address the illegal encampment. A small number of blatantly antisemitic actions on the grounds of the encampment have been credibly reported, but we have no evidence that any members of our UW–Madison community engaged in this odious activity.  We have received and are investigating bias reports involving individuals from outside of our campus community. The presence of non-community members, including, reportedly, several highly aggressive individuals, is one of the predictable harms of an encampment like the one illegally staged on our campus and is one of the reasons we chose to act today. Let me state clearly that true threats and harassment based on one’s identity, religion or national origin will not be tolerated on our campus. Anyone experiencing this is urged to file a bias report. And let me repeat loudly and unequivocally that we must all roundly condemn both Islamophobia and antisemitism.  Like many other college campuses across the country and the world, we expect to continue to face protest activity, and we recognize and respect that protest is part of our community’s precious right to free speech and expression. But such rights are not unlimited: The boundaries that our laws and code of conduct place on speech are meant to ensure that all have access to our common spaces and that dialogue takes place without intimidation or exclusion.  Now that the tents have been removed, and as long as protest abides by campus and state rules and policies, members of my leadership team stand ready to continue to listen to the concerns of the members of our community involved in this week’s protest. This was a condition we communicated to protesters repeatedly.  In addition, we have held a valuable set of engagements around issues of concern with members of Muslim, Palestinian and Jewish communities over the course of this academic year and we invite continued dialogue. I recognize that many in the Muslim and Palestinian communities on our campus continue to feel unheard and hope we can create further opportunities for engagement and understanding.  I also understand that many of our Jewish community members have experienced fear and anxiety during this year as well as during this week’s protest. I am grateful to campus partners and others who provided care for them over the past several challenging days during which they sought to celebrate the conclusion of Passover.  The role of campus leadership is not to take sides in national and international debates, or to make special allowances for particular points of view, but to ensure that all participants in campus life have access to university resources for learning and growth. We recognize that the campus debates of the last few months take place in the shadow of international violence that has touched a great many students, faculty and staff, either directly or indirectly. This violence has created strong emotions of fear and anger among many segments of our community.  We express our profound empathy for those who have had to navigate this academic year amid ongoing grief and heartbreak due to the devastating destruction, injustice, and loss of life in Israel and Gaza. If you’re a student who needs support related to this or any other situation, the university is prepared to help. If you’re a faculty or staff member, contact the Employee Assistance Office.  As we move into the waning days of this academic year, I look forward to a commencement celebration with the very special class of 2024 who largely missed out on their high school graduation festivities because of the pandemic. I thank our faculty and staff for providing a rich and impactful educational experience to our students over the past year. And as we collectively reflect on the activities and lessons of the past week, let us, even in the midst of great challenge, do all we can to recognize and respect each other’s humanity and seek to understand those with viewpoints different from our own.”",reddit,campus
"I feel like going to UW ruined my life  Well it isn't really the university's fault but... I don't know. I graduated high school in 2017 and I always did well in school, lived in state, the natural choice was UW Madison. I knew tons of people who went there and I love the city still. The biggest thing I should have realized was my mental health was NOT ready for such a big change and such a big school. I was already starting to slip in school by senior year and I guess I thought college would be better somehow. 


Got to the dorms and immediately felt out of place. It seemed like everyone else was rich, social, smart, happy and belonged there. I felt like I was poor, not that smart, definitely having a lot of mental battles and I just felt like I didn't fit in at all. I got overwhelmed with classes right away and felt too ashamed to ask for help and soon I was too far behind to be helped. I also had to work a lot to make money and I got a campus job but it only paid like $9/hr. 



Eventually got so depressed that I stopped going to classes a lot and was missing work. Got fired from my job and started donating plasma, got deferred from that too so I had NO source of income. I maxed out a credit card and then started eating from the campus food pantry (bless them.) I started seeing UHS but they only had group therapy available, which was off putting to me. I started seeing a free off campus counselor but it was like an hour bus ride each way. 


I just got so depressed and fell so far behind, had no money, I just had to leave. I went to a full time inpatient care facility for a little bit. My intention was to return summer of 2018... Well 2024 and I still haven't been back to school. Now it's all about rent, bills, car payment... I don't have the finances to go back to school even if I wanted to (which I do.)


Add on to that, I still owe about $2000 directly to the university and they won't release my transcript unless I pay it. I even looked into community college and they need that transcript before I even apply.



So now at 25 I'm still stuck at a job making minimum wage in my state (not WI), bogged down student loan payments and medical debt, and I can't go back to school unless I pull $2k out of thin air PLUS the cost to actually go to school. And then I wonder, would I just fail and drop out again? 




Worst decision I ever made going to college unfortunately. Ended up with almost $20k in debt for less than one year, student loan payments, no degree, and no marketable job skills. And I can't go back to school now, whereas if I just hadn't gone in the first place I'd be free to make the decision now to do so. 



Anyway I don't know why I'm here. I still love Madison and maybe in another life it could have worked out, but I crashed and burned miserably and now have nothing to show for it but debt.",reddit,campus
"Finance Grad to Elementary Ed Hi all,

I (22M) recently graduated from UW in 2024 with a finance degree. I pursued investment banking right out of school and have hated every second of it. I feel like i’m wasting my life and not using any of my skills. 

For context, I absolutely love kids! I was a teaching assistant in high school and a camp counselor for a couple summers throughout college.

"Doubles vs Triples vs Quad? + housing suggestions hi! im an incoming freshman and most of my preferred halls (Dejope, Leopold, Ogg) only have triples for incoming freshmen. Witte and Sellery are the doubles towards the bottom of my list + Lowell since I didn't like the location. Off topic but, is Lowell's location inconvinient? it seems far from the rest of the halls/rest of campus. 

I see a lot of people saying triples are just rooms for doubles with another person added which sucks. I definitely want space (waters seems great but no a/c so that's the last on my list). How are the triples in Dejope, Leopold, and Ogg? What has your experience been like? I am lowk not mentally ready for a triple and i was thinking about doubles this entire time but it shouldnt be that bad i hope.

My logic seems flawed but I initially thought a quad would be better than a triple coz trio friend groups never work out, and with a quad it's an even number of people so you could do important things in pairs if you need help w something (im sure i could ask someone outside my room tho) and if you don't get along w the other two in a triple you'd be singled out. however im not expecting to be besties w my roomates anyways. So would you say a triple is better since you'd have less people to deal with than in a quad, or are there any other cons? Should I be prioritizing doubles on my list (hence these would be SE dorms that im not so into or LS that dont have a/c) or is a triple fine from your experience? The halls I'd like to get don't have a/c BUT have doubles, and the halls that im cool with are triples :/

btw are box fans annoying af and dont do the job well? A friend who used to live in the dorms a year ago said a/c was necessary and my parents agree too, but i dunno, i dont feel convinced (im from a hotter climate).

Also does anyone know what 'XYZ Hall - Any Room' means? Let's say there's only 'Philips - Double with Bath' and 'Philips - Any Room' in the drop down. If I selected 'Philips - Any Room' would that by default mean 'Philips - Double with Bath' since that was the only other option? I wanted to know since the website says if you select 'any room' you'd have more chances of getting that room. Would it not matter in the example I just gave?

My list rn in case someone could help me out or give me suggestions:  
i haven't factored in whether i should be prioritizing doubles or triples yet.

1. Philips - Double with Bath (coz private bathroom)  
2. Dejope - Triple (really want LS + it seems p social)  
3. Ogg - Triple (not as social as witte/sellery but is also a good party dorm i think, gym's close by)  
4. Leopold - Triple (LS but seems equidistant from four lakes or carson's, gand i think it's that social)  
5. Witte - Double (uh worried it might get loud)  
6. Sellery - Double (also might get reallyreally loud)  
7. Lowell - Double with Bath (I didn't like the location :/)  
7. Waters - Double (last coz it doesnt have an a/c, might switch it out w smith)

opinions on smith since the bathroom is like a single use communal bathroom that you have to share with 7 peeople. Thoughts about Ogg in general and the party scene. What's the mix coed by cluster thing like?

basically i want a not too social but social dorm, a double, LS, + close to a gym. buuuut that's not actually possible, so suggestions or advice would be really helpful! thank you for reading my long ass post lmao",reddit,campus
"Roommate troubles I live in a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 other boys. One of them is my friend from home and the other guys is the biggest nut job I’d ever met. Until this incident we still always had to fight with him, for example, the other day he rejected the idea of having to take equal responsibility and clean spaces in regular intervals. Because he said he’d rather clean up after each use. But he doesn’t. It’s nasty disgusting, but apparently he is clean according to him and meeting his standards should be good enough for everybody. We have mice in the house but he said we didn’t need a floor mop bcuz it’s just not necessary. Yeah he’s clean lol. 
On to the incident. I had a proctored test online yesterday morning. I let both of them know before hand that id be giving a test and to be mindful of that. He immediately came home and as I was started I said please keep it down, I’m gonna be writing a test. He immediately comes into the kicten and starts playing annoying music loud enough so I can hear it. I’m the middle of my test I was literally begging him to turn it down but he said “he’s not responsible for it and I should’ve been more responsible “ and when I lost patience and shouted shut the fuck up he went on and on yelling mean shit which was frankly very scary bcuz it didn’t make sense why I was getting screamed at and honestly I hadn’t slept in a few days and I had the anxiety all of this broke me down, again, during the exam. Now I wasn’t able to perform as well and he completely ruined it. He went on for 30 minutes, the test duartion was 80 minutes. After the test I completely broke down and started arguing with him about why he did that. He still kept shouting that’s not my responsibility. I yelled it’s not just your house you don’t pay the whole rent we live here too, would he be okay had I done the same, am I entitled to be as loud as possible when he’s trying to study or sleep ? He then yelled you didn’t tell me it’s a proctored test. A test is a test, irrespective of this be. You be respectful of it and you don’t make unnecessarily loud noises it’s common fucking sense. Gosh he then does the screaming but by then Im in the middle of a mental breakdown and he was screaming. 
After all this I still apologised for yelling back but he said that he’s completely justified in this and that I should have to be more responsible about my exams. Where else would I give the fucking test ? In the middle of the street ? 
I’ve lost my mental peace and now he’s ruining my career. All this and this lil piece of shit still believes he’s entitled to do whatever in the house whenever he wants to. This is the most frustrating part. An apology and I would’ve completely let this go but the blindness and the entitlement about not this this but literally every single issue is seriously tolling. 

I just don’t know how to deal with this. I want to take action but I have no idea what I can do.  Oh btw he’s also super creepy he hovers outside the bathroom whenever I’m in there, he’d admitted to entering my room when I wasn’t home. 
Please advice me on what I can do, if not give me some good ideas on how I can be the same asshole he is to me, return the favour.",reddit,general madison

I am a sophomore majoring in CS. I am completing cs400 this semester. Although it took awhile I am seeing that I should start developing some personal projects and I can a couple Ideas I would like to implement. I have a couple questions that hopefully some students that have more experience in this field can answer. 

  
1. I am seeing that personal projects are a good start to get experience, show personal interest, good on resumes. But I do not know where to even start. I have seen projects like pulling information from an API. How does a project pull information from an API? And where do you even create a project? Is there a website I can put my projects in? How do I make a website for my project, Would I have to pay for it?  

  
2. I saw a video saying NeetCode is a good website to learn algorithms, But I do not want to pay 200-400 dollars for the premium subscription. Is the free version still good to learn algorithms?

  
3. Any other suggestions that I can do will help as well

"Any Advice for Introverted Girls Trying to Find a Date? 
I've been trying to find a boyfriend for a while now, but I’m a bit of an introvert and, to be honest, I sometimes struggle with social situations to the point where it feels borderline misanthropic. I don’t enjoy crowded places or activities that require lots of social interaction, and I think this has made dating more difficult for me.

I’ve pushed myself to try some of the common advice for meeting people, but so far, nothing has worked out. I don’t enjoy sports, I don’t drink, and I don’t smoke, so bars, parties, and other typical social settings are pretty much off the table. I’ve tried making small talk in class, but it always feels awkward. English is my second language, and I think that adds to my nervousness and makes conversations even more challenging. One of the experiences I’ve had was during a biology lab group project. It was just me, a dude, and another girl. They hit it off right away and started dating by our third discussion. I felt completely ignored unless I was talking about the assignment. It sucked.

I’ve also joined game clubs, thinking they might attract people with similar interests, maybe shy, nerdy types like me. Unfortunately, it didn’t go any better. I remember going to a game night hosted by WUD where people were playing horror games on the Switch. I was ready to find someone to team up with, but I ended up playing alone for two hours. Nobody approached me or sat with me, and it felt pretty rough looking back on it.

I’ve tried joining group games on game nights and making the first move by asking if I could join others. The guys would let me play, but they never started conversations with me, and eye contact was rare. It felt like they were more comfortable joking around with their male friends, and I struggled to break into the group dynamic.

Dating apps are also not working very well for me. My friend (who is just as introverted as I am) even tried to hitting on boys on street. She did that by writing “Can I have your Instagram?” on a piece of paper and handed it to any guy she thought was cute. She did get some Instagrams that way, but she told me it was nearly impossible to keep a conversation going or get them to hang out.

I still want a boyfriend. I kinda just want to have someone to snuggle with after a long day. But sometimes I question if it's worth the effort, especially when it feels like I’m pushing myself to my limit just to be in social situations without panicking. 

So, is there any advice out there for someone like me? Should I keep pushing myself out of my comfort zone, or is it better to just be myself and hope someone comes along? Maybe I should accept that it’s okay to enjoy playing Switch games solo on my couch after a long day instead of chasing the idea of having a boyfriend to hug.",reddit,general madison
"therapy without insurance Hi! I'm going to be a freshman at UW Madison, and have not had access to therapy because my parents don't really believe in it. I've been researching UW's free therapy options and I haven't been hearing good things about UHS (specifically, that they try forcing you into group therapy, which I really am not comfortable with). I've tried to see other therapy options outside of UW but they all require insurance. SHIP is apparently the best for your money, but I think I might need a while before I am able to afford it.

"Roommate renting issues  Hi I was wondering what do you guys think is the fair way to split rent. Recently I met 5 different girls through Facebook late August and we just needed a place to stay. We got a nice place close to state street with free indoor laundry, and new kitchen and bathrooms. How would you split the rent evenly? At first we decided to split by room. Since there is 6 girls and 5 bedrooms two of them who were friends were definitely okay with sharing a bedroom and somehow we decided they can split the price of one bedroom which means each is paying half of what the rest is paying with and additional 25 dollars each for an occupancy fee. I originally agreed on this because we just needed to pay deposit and first month of September however, I just don’t think it’s fair. Yes I agree they should pay less but they are paying way less than I think is fair. I’m planning to talk to them however, the two girls are freaking out and thinking it’s not fair and the rest either are too uncomfortable to speak up or don’t care. I think they should pay a bit more because of the amenities we have which is a great location, free laundry, everyone just gets to share a bathroom with a second person since there’s 3 bathrooms. What do you think? Every room is similar size, except with each having some quirks like more windows/bigger closet, ect.",reddit,downtown
"Personally I would recommend living in the dorms. But it’s really up to what you value the most, money or life experiences. I loved the dorms and I lived in lakeshore. I live in an apartment now and I genuinely miss the dorms. I think it’s an experience that is worth having and this is the one time in your life where you will be able to experience anything like it. My mom had a similar predicament as you when she went to college, living at home to save money or living in the dorms. She picked to commute and save money, and that is now one of her regrets in life. Sometimes spending the money is worth it. Another thing I want to add is usually the dorms is how you meet your lifelong friends, acclimate to college in general, etc. I met my best friend in the dorms. You can meet friends in other ways yes but it will help so much if you are surrounded by your peers for your first year of college. I would recommend spending the extra money for freshman year, and you can change your mind sophomore year. Sure you might hate the dorms but you won’t know unless you try it.",reddit,general madison
"My advice is to focus on finding people who like to do whatever it is you like to do. Once you have your groups for those things, it won't really matter and you won't really care what other people, or the majority of people, are doing. In my experience, the responses in the genre of ""just go to bars anyway, no one knows if you're actually drinking!"" are missing the point--yes, you *can* do that, but that's...not actually any fucking fun for a lot of people. Take all of the alcohol out of a bar, and what you're left with is still not something I would want to go to, so me not drinking at one doesn't solve the fundamental issue that I want to be doing something completely different than that. 

For me, that's finding people who like board games, or  movies, or concerts, or going to restaurants, or watching hockey, etc., and then I couldn't care less if other people are having a drink while we're doing those things. For you, maybe it's a book club or an amateur sports league or whatever. But trying to find that in bars or at parties, or with people who only ever want to go to bars or parties, is a fool's errand. You've gotta focus on what you want to do and specifically pursue that, whether on reddit or in any local groups or spaces devoted to those things.",reddit,general madison
"The Vision(Going out done right) IM. SO. SORRY. IF THIS IS A NOVEL IM JUST  PASSIONATE. So here's a Too Fkn long didn't Fkn read (It's a great Novel you should really read the full post! you wont be disappointed. Jane Austen eat your heart out) 

TFLDFR: I'm an Artist / DJ in the process of doing  more events and themed parties in madison. And I'm wondering if the area is craving the same energy that im craving / curating. To dance, Meet people, Have a good time . (Update: Themed Party in the works for January 11!!)


Writing this at 5 AM is quite insane, but the passion of my cat at 5 AM was contagious. So a bit of Backstory. I'm a 22 yo. Artist / DJ in the area by the name DarkenDabe (you might have seen me play around downtown) and I've lived in the area for *longer than I'd like* but while I'm still here I've always thought this city had *potential* especially the freaking campus! You have some super talented creatives, some foward thinking individuals, Pro level athletes, and SPOTTED COW!

I Have a Vision (MLK Darken) an actual *scene* in Madison. The type of scene for people similar to me or who just want to experience the Vision.
And for that to happen people must gather. I've gone out here plenty and played some of these spots plenty. Whiskeys, Sottos, Wandos, Brats,  even the other side of capital; Tavernakya, Planespoke, Cardinal, etc. Spots like TK and such have alot more sauce Imo, definitely groovy and the crowds are 21 n up for sureskis rather than Mondays and whiskeys roll your dice pick of the  lot. Now I don't know about you, but if im going out the intention is to Dance, Meet people, And have a good time. Remember these three tenets 🫡 Dance! Meet people! Have a good time! 

When I go out here *in instances of when I'm not the one performing* I always feel like something is missing. SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN IM PLAYING! it's so close, SOMETIMES!  And I've even felt it at other periods of times vividly Ex:(I went to liquid during their new years show last year. I was so sauce  and that was probably the best experience I've had going out in madison) 

Remember kids, Dance! Meet people! Have a good time! To me, in life,  building conections and having experiences with these connections are the foundational elements to life. I believe this is food for the soul really.  As much as I love getting baked, going out drinking with my friends, and hitting the dance floor, the reason why it's fun is because I'm building connections and sharing experinces with these connections.

So as I've started to do shows and peform around the city I've been meeting people, other musicians, artists, students, and people who just like to have fun. Plenty of times when in play I have people approach me and be surprised by the music I curate and it's somewhat shocking to me because although my ego tells me I'm like *that*  (and I am?) Aswell as  that I take music very seriously, I do think that overall it's not like  I'm introducing fire to humans for this first time.  I think it's just that this area is desperately craving what I've been desperately craving. DANCE, MEET PEOPLE, HAVE A GOOD TIME!

How do we make this better? 
How do we create a scene for this?

A scene for Creatives, for the adventurous, the MUSIC LOVERS! That appeals to extroverts and introverts alike, so you can be dancing in the middle of the floor with the crowd or  you could be chillin in the corner sipping on cocktail with your friends. Music that's all encompassing,  not just 2000s and 2010s pop hits , not just rap, not edm but all of that and none of that something new and fresh but also nostalgic at the same time. (I'm pulling out the buzz words now) 

But most importantly, It makes you wanna dance. It makes you wanna sing. It makes you wanna share moments with others. 

There was a part of me that got discourged from my vision because of some interactions I've had while playing. There has been some moments  where I thought I maybe misread that potential and some reccuring instances of people not  knowing (not to sound like a utter douchebag I swear) ""DJ or overall Artist etiquette"" but I also understand that these interactions are mostly with people in altered state of beings but.. cmon.  A. Do you all think your song request is gonna bang? Like just admit you wanna hear it for yourself, I had some guy recently drunkenly spit talking trying to convince me to play Levels by Avicii as if the reason the 7 people at Wandos on a slow night weren't dancing is because I didn't play Levels... 😂  plus selfish is nothing but a loaded term. And B. We're listening to girly hyperpop club music and you see all the people vibing to it and you want me to play Shaboozy now? TFILL? 
 
EITHER WAY, I've been biased towards thinking  house parties being better than bars. Better music generally, it's more intimate, you can smoke za (if your party is cool) but don't get shit twisted ganger, there are benefits to the bars as well. Alcohol acesss, safer* (I'd want some women's input on this to be able to say that confidently), higher quality sound systems and presentation (for all the music lovers this is important, those moments when your *just* intoxicated enough to start confusing your breathing to the song's beat and the lights feel like your in a music video *PEAK*) 

""Get to the point bro, stop all the yapping""
""Oh Brother, This guy stinks."" The Reddit comments jeered 
""Fine fine let me cut to the chase."" Our Handsome, sexy, awesome, 6'5, modest protagonist relents.

The reason I'm telling you this is to say that I've been in the process of throwing more events and parties around the city. During october, I threw a halloween party with some friends called Nocturnal Frenzy.  We had alot of moving parts involved! We decorated the crib, 
we had cameramen, we had photographers videographers, I ran sound and audio. It was super fun, I made a bunch of posters for it,  we did a bunch of promotion. My buddy a bartender made us a cocktail menu and he bartended the party!! we all wore costumes, I had prosthetics makeup! I was djing the whole night. Someone  passed me a blunt while I was playing, shit was heavenly.  We had a freaking line wrapped around the cribo. Shit was incredibly worth it though because everyone that was able to come in, had an amazing time. As you can guess they danced, met people, and had a good time. 

Long story short. Me and my people have the opportunity to do more things in the city. Things at veneus. The inkling of a chance to shape some level of culture and community ( think about the possibility of a real genuine fun third space as well) I ask you, dear reader. Who's patience is surely worn by now. What are you  looking for? What do you want from the experiences and moments you share when you go out? Hell, why do you go out?  Answer or ask whatever you please.

"Why we need a new free speech movement by Robert Reich - And why universities should sue the Trump regime for abridging the First Amendment rights of their institutions and their students Friends,

The Trump regime is actively suppressing speech at major American universities.

Trump’s recent executive orders bar diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at all educational institutions that receive federal funds.

Last week, Trump threatened in a social media post to punish any university that permits “illegal” protests but did not define what he meant by illegal protests.

On Friday he cancelled hundreds of millions in grants and contracts with Columbia University for allowing peaceful protests the regime dislikes.

On Saturday, Trump’s immigration officials arrested a Columbia graduate student — who is a permanent resident of the United States with a green card and an American wife — and sent him to a prison in Louisiana. Why? He did not engage in criminal activity. The graduate student peacefully expressed political views that the regime dislikes.

Then on Monday, the Trump regime warned 60 universities that they could face penalties for allowing peaceful demonstrations and speech that the administration dislikes.

And on Tuesday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokeswoman, told reporters that Columbia had refused to help the regime identify people engaged in speech the regime found objectionable, and warned, “We expect all America’s colleges and universities to comply with this administration’s policy.”

The particular objectionable speech that the regime is using as a pretext for its crackdown on free speech on university campuses is the student-led protests against Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government for its bombardment of Gaza.

Trump has turned those protests into accusations of antisemitism. Trump’s border czar, Thomas Homan, described the graduate student who was arrested and whose green card was voided as a “national security threat.”

But let’s be clear: Peaceful protests against Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies in Gaza are not the same as antisemitism. (As I’ve said repeatedly in this letter, I’m Jewish, I am not antisemitic, and I am disgusted and appalled by what Netanyahu has done to Palestinians in Gaza.) Nor does a peaceful protest turn someone into a national security threat.

And let’s be clear about another thing: The Trump regime is using antisemitism as an excuse for cracking down on free speech on university campuses.

Trump used the same accusation against Democrats during his presidential campaign — blaming the alleged rise in antisemitism on “the leadership of this country,” but conveniently ignoring the fact that the rise in reported antisemitic acts began during Trump’s first term.

Trump also conveniently disregarded prominent Republicans who have engaged in antisemitic behavior — such as North Carolina’s then nominee for governor, Mark Robinson, who called himself a “black NAZI” on a pornographic website, and Trump ally Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has made a string of antisemitic remarks, including blaming Jews for killing Jesus to explain her vote against a bill meant to address antisemitism.

The real reason Trump and the Republican Party are cracking down on universities is their belief that universities are dominated by the left.

As I’ve noted, JD Vance (Yale Law ‘13) has called university professors “the enemy” and suggested using Victor Orban’s method for ending “left-wing domination of universities” — giving universities “a choice between survival or [being] … much more open to conservative ideas.”

Yet whether you like or dislike what’s said at universities, free speech is at the core of our democracy, and protecting it should be one of the core missions of universities.

Which is why America needs a new Free Speech Movement, similar to the one that broke out on college campuses 61 years ago.


Do you remember?

In the fall of 1964, soon after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency, Berkeley’s university police arrested a student who was staffing a table in the middle of Sproul Plaza and put him in a police car. The student had violated Berkeley’s ban on political activity on campus.

When someone in the surrounding crowd of students yelled, “We can see better if we sit down,” hundreds of students sat — trapping the police car for the next 33 hours. Berkeley administrators negotiated an end to the siege but refused to end the ban on political activity.

The student protests grew. At an even larger rally, a graduate student named Mario Savio addressed the crowd, criticizing not only Berkeley but America itself.

There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part, you can’t even tacitly take part, and you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop. And you’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you’re free, the machine will be prevented from working at all.

Hundreds of Berkeley students occupied its administration building, leading police to make the largest mass arrest of students in American history and shocking a public accustomed to campus conformity.

As Savio later told The Washington Post, the Free Speech Movement was an outgrowth of the Civil Rights Movement. “Are we on the side of the civil rights movement? Or have we gotten back to the comfort and security of Berkeley, California, and can we forget the [Black] sharecroppers whom we worked with [to register to vote] just a few weeks back? Well, we couldn’t forget.”

A few days after Savio’s speech, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover told aides that he feared Savio and other protesters would inspire student rebellion at other colleges across the land. Hoover turned his secret surveillance machine on Savio, including covert action to “disrupt” and “neutralize” him, for more than a decade.

In 1976, a U.S. Senate subcommittee exposed these activities and forced the FBI to restrict those it investigated and what measures it could take. (The guidelines remained in effect until September 11, 2001, after which time George W. Bush’s attorney general, John Ashcroft, loosened them to “fight terrorism,” and the Patriot Act gave the FBI more power to pry.)

Now, Trump is president and the FBI is under Kash Patel.

If I were young university student again (wouldn’t that be nice?), I’d do whatever I could to reignite the flame of the Free Speech Movement. It’s needed today as much if not more than it was 61 years ago. (If you’re a university student, I urge you to take this suggestion to heart. If you know any university students, you might suggest this to them.)

If I were in charge of any of the 60 American universities that Trump has just threatened for allowing “illegal” protests, I’d join together with the heads of the others and sue the Trump regime for violating the First Amendment rights of those universities and their students.

"2 questions about FT campus positions I'm a graduate student and I'm graduating next month. I've been working part-time as a student on campus for 3 years. I want to stay in Madison and I am applying for some FT university staff positions recommended by my supervisor. However, I have 2 questions I'm hoping someone might be able to help me with.

1 - On the applications, there's a question about if you have been employed by UW Madison or UW Systems. Do I say yes to both of them? My supervisor doesn't know and neither do I. I've only worked here on the UW Madison campus, but all of my paychecks say ""University of Wisconsin Systems"" in the top left coroner, although the Business Unit says ""UWMSN"" too.  I don't know if it matters, but I've had work study and non-work study jobs on campus. Does anyone know what I should put?

2 - I've been on some... ahem... Dee Eee Eye... committees in both the university I transferred from and here on campus. With the current climate, do you think I should take these off my resume?

He always talks about his separation from his wife and keeps inviting me places like his housewarming party and a Brewers game.

"Subleasing Oliv apartment Hi, my daughter is looking for a subleaser starting this spring semester, but so far she's only posted it on the off-campus marketplace and some FB groups. Any recommendations on places she should try posting sublease info? 

She's offering a discounted sublease at a newly built apartment building (Oliv) with an excellent location and amenities like a rooftop pool, fitness center, numerous study spaces, hot tubs, onsite coffee shop, computer lab w free printing, game room, dog park, steam room, sauna, etc. (Every time I visit, I'm jealous that I don't live there.) As a parent, my favorite thing about this place is how secure it is. Access to each floor requires a fob, you can lock/unlock your apartment door remotely, and each individual bedroom also has its own lock.

I told her a year ago that I won't be helping fund her Study Abroad semester unless she locates a subleaser, but she procrastinated and now she's desperate for more ideas on where to post her sublease. Any ideas are much appreciated!",reddit,campus

"I used worked there, I am a 25% Hispanic but I don’t look it and people react to me thinking I’m just a white guy. I have noticed from my limited perspective, in no way do I want to discourage you and Madison benefits from diversity but it’s going to be a struggle. The big problem is there aren’t many black folks in Wisconsin and people fear what they don’t understand and some kids really tend to parrot their parents beliefs and they say or use racist tropes without fully thinking about it. A student worker once told me how in her town they called Mexicans “fence jumpers” and I informed her part of my family comes from Mexico and that’s insanely racist and her response was “no you’re not”, not a “oh I’m sorry I shouldn’t have said that”. One year Cinco De Mayo landed on the Mifflin st block party and kids kept coming into where I worked wearing sombreros, ponchos, and cheesy mustaches (it was all dudes) just projecting all these racist tropes and when I asked them to stop because it’s offensive and I found it disrespectful to my heritage they just kicked it up a notch.

"Help Needed: UW-Madison Transcript Request Issue (International Student from India) Hi everyone,

I’m an international student from India, admitted to the MS in Information – Campus Program at UW-Madison. I received an email stating that UW-Madison needs an official transcript from my university (Savitribai Phule Pune University – SPPU, India).

However, SPPU has a policy that they will not send my transcript unless UW-Madison first sends a formal transcript request to their official email (transcript@unipune.ac.in).

I have already emailed UW-Madison admissions about this but haven’t received a response yet.

Has anyone faced a similar issue? Or does anyone know how long UW-Madison takes to process such requests? Any advice on how to handle this situation?

Additionally, I had previously ordered sealed, official transcripts from my university. Although UW-Madison mentions that transcripts submitted by students are not accepted, is there any way I can request them to make an exception?

"Scammer on Campus Hi all— I have worked in East Campus mall for a few years now, and there is a woman who has routinely tried to scam me and other young women. She only approaches young women, and says she needs help getting to a domestic violence shelter in Portage. 

She shows you her ID to try to prove it’s not a scam, but she has told me this story roughly 8 times over the last two years. She says that the DAIS center in Madison turned her away, and she needs money or a ride to Portage. She stopped my coworker and I yesterday and I told her off. She was waiting inside East Campus Mall and tried asking us for money. And I said, it’s ridiculous that she is praying on young women with an abuse sob story to get money from them. There is another woman who was arrested in Madison a few years back for doing this exact same scam— please be vigilant. 

Last summer, she also tried to force her way into my girlfriend’s car at Cap Center after she bought her some food when she asked. She banged on the window and tried to break in, after my partner said she wouldn’t be giving her a ride to the bus stop (that was a block away).

"We're fortunate to have a wonderful variety of coffeeshops and roasters all with their own vibes and quirks. Happy to share my recommendations (I can be picky sometimes.)

* Bradbury's - lovely little spot off the square. Rotating coffees. Wonderful pour overs. Crepes and scones too.
* Broken Board - among the most underrated in town. Their out-of-the-way location (in a skate shop near East Towne) doesn't help their cause, but if you're looking to check out all of the independently owned shops, this is a must. They know their stuff.
* Indie Coffee - Special spot right off campus on Regent St. Usually pretty busy with students, but definitely a must if you're checking out different spots. Good cold brew.
* Domestique - European-style, feature a variety of coffees, small spot on Willy (and in Northstreet)
* Johnson Public House - Awesome eclectic coffeehouse on Johnson
* Reverie Bakery - On Winnebago, another underrated spot. Only other spot in town other than JPH that primary brews Kin-Kin (I think they roast it there too.)
* Ledger Coffee - Located in Garver Feed Mill, feel like owner Richard doesn't quite get the recognition they deserve given their set-up and unique blends. Cold brew is fantastic. While they don't have a place to sit (you take your coffee into Garver), it's definitely worth checking out.
* Wonderstate - Right on the square. Some folks can be mixed on the space itself, but the coffee is wonderful and roasted our in Viroqua. One of my go-to's when grabbing local beans to home brew

  
Others that are certainly worth checking out: EVP (East Wash spot is always quiet with I grab a cup), Ancora (a chain, but locally-owned and have still done a nice job despite their growth), Lakeside St (busy coffeehouse just south of the Bay - nice for a summer sit), Crema Cafe (more of a cafe and brews Colectivo, but enjoy their drip and cold brew), Madison Chocolate Company (a bit of an outlier, but have always had a nice cup when sitting outside at their Monroe St spot.)",reddit,capitol square

The gay couple was denied service because they were gay ... that’s discrimination based on identity, which violates civil rights laws.

It’s asking people, especially straight folks, to be aware of how their behavior or presence might shift the dynamic in spaces that exist because of decades of exclusion.

No one’s saying straight people should be legally barred from entering gay bars. We’re saying that if you walk into a space that was created for a marginalized group, and your presence starts to dominate or make that group feel uncomfortable in their own space, it’s worth taking a step back and asking why.

The other nearby taco truck on Park, Los Cowboys de Morelos, hasn't been there as much lately, but if you see it, try it for sure.

Hmong Legacy Market is also close to there, and they have a great lunch counter.

For American-style Chinese food, I like A8 China, which is very reasonably-priced and has lunch specials with big portions.

The Silk Road has the best grilled meats in town. Not as cheap, but big portions.

The Globe has the spiciest food I've tried in Madison. Not as cheap, but enormous portions and very good.

Tokyo Sushi and Sushi Express are both good, and they both have $10.95 two-roll specials.

"It's because of the good wages you mention.  Let's say a childcare provider makes prevailing wage, H dollars per hour.  For reference, you can make $15-$18 an hour in fast food or convenience stores right now.  Let's also say that you work 8 hours per day, but you need to drop off your kids before and after that, so probably more like 9 or 10 hours of work.  A childcare provider can watch 4 kids at a time, and you've got 3, so you need 6.75 H worth of labor each day.  That's not factoring in any other costs, like snacks/meals, health insurance, etc.  If it's a center, there's a monthly lease payment plus utilities, etc.  

If you also make H per hour, and work 8 hours per day, you get 8 H each day.  But after taxes and whatnot, you take home maybe 30% of that, so it's actually 5.6 H.  You're actually losing money by working.  Either you or your spouse should be a stay-at home parent.  Unless both of you are making at least two or three times as much as your childcare providers are making, it doesn't make sense for both parents to work.  

In-home care is cheaper, as there's generally not any leased property involved.  But are snacks/meals included?  Do they need insurance beyond normal homeowner / rental insurance?  Health insurance?

"Yeah I feel that, but obviously different as a White person. I no longer have the many POC friends I did in Chicago bc of the segregation here, and it’s honestly not something I’ve gotten past. Plus the LGBTQ+ scene can be kinda clicky and weird (I’m queer). However, I’ve discovered a few venues/bars which encourage mixing diversity and identity - one of them is Crucible, which is a nightclub. Then there’s the Sylvee, which is a concert venue, and they do a decent job of getting lots of different big touring bands (their sound is hit or miss bc of the corrugated metal they chose to put up everywhere, though🙄). The Majestic is another but smaller concert venue - very LGBTQ+ friendly and a variety of different bands, touring &amp; local (potentially better sound). I’m sure others might have some suggestions to add here too. Try not to fret - true, it’s not Chicago, but it’s also got some things worth exploring (highly HIGHLY recommend the Chazen Museum, if you’re into art - it’s seriously incredible).",reddit,general madison

"I was searching Reddit for restaurant advice for a city I am visiting and to calibrate how good the tips might be, I checked in on what people here recommended for Madison, where I live, and I would say this is such a solid list, even though in many cases people left out the why for their choices. 

To contribute, I would add the Colectivo on Monroe Street or the Square, as well as Wonderstate on the square, for coffee and coffee shop food, including a range of breakfast sandwiches and more served all day. when the weather is nice, especially crisp fall nice, Colectivo's open-air experience is hard to beat -- they open up the windows and walls and have a fireplace inside. 

No one that I see has mentioned Gates and Brovi, which is owned by the same people as Sardine, which several have recommended. It is more casual, great fish fry, neighborhood feel.

Butterbird on Regent Street is like if Wes Anderson created a chicken shop. The same owners run Harvey House, which has been mentioned as an outstanding homage to supper clubs, and I'd agree. 

Lastly, I'd want to add Sala Thai, which might have been mentioned, but is amazing. It is slow. It is run by a wonderful family. In the glory days, they ran a small convenience store on Willy Street and sold a few carry-out curry dishes that were so good they just blew your MF mind. And they were like $5. This was back in the day.

The city tries hard. All the restaurants have a lot of competition. Any of these recommendations, plus something you just see on google nearby, is probably going to be good.",reddit,capitol square

"[Fresh Mart International Supermarket](https://freshmartmadison.com) is on 3313 University Ave., where Whole Foods used to be. It's fantastic, with an incredible selection of cheeses, yogurts, groceries, wines and liquors from all over, an incredible meat counter, and much, much more. They have a cafe, a hot bar, and sushi made in-house by a person I talked to who was so enthusiastic about it, and so happy to see me putting tray after tray into my cart.

Unfortunately, there are some really bad marketing decisions at play that could totally tank it. 

First is the name. ""Fresh Mart"" sounds like a convenience store, not like a full-service international store. (Yes, ""International Supermarket,"" is technically in the name, but it's more or less a small-print afterthought.)

Making matters worse is the similarity to the name of ""Fresh Market Madison"" near campus. Even the URLs are nearly identical: freshmartmadison.com vs. freshmadisonmarket.com. 

in fact, I had to go back and forth between tabs several times to get the names and the URLs right, and I'm sure I won't remember two minutes from now.

As if that weren't bad enough, they're both on University Ave. So when I search for Fresh Mart on University Avenue in Madison, the first several Google results I get are all related to Fresh Madison Market (the one near campus).

Next: the logo and signage. It's not good. It's an awkward font and the colors are so pale that the brand-new sign out front looks like it's old and faded. It literally looks like it's been out there for 50 years. I never would have stopped in, had I not heard about the place from word of mouth -- the impression is that it might not even be in business anymore. That's how bad the sign is, unfortunately.

If they put up a snazzy sign, that would help SO MUCH. That is the first thing they should do, in my opinion -- hire one of these great creative teams in Madison to make them a bold, appealing logo, and put it on the sign.

They need a better name to go with it. Something that communicates what they are. Yes, they have fresh stuff. But the main thing that makes them special is that they're an international supermarket.

Finally, they have the bad luck to open during construction on University Ave. It's hard to get in there. Who knows when the construction will be done -- in Madison, they tend to tear up everything all at once early in spring, and then leave stuff torn up for months and months while they go around completing each project in town one by one. That's how it seems, anyway. It's incredibly destructive to local businesses, which is in turn incredibly destructive to the fabric and personality of the city itself -- but they've been doing this for years.

I hope so much that this place will survive long enough to become a popular, beloved fixture in Madison.

Please shop there and support them!",reddit,campus

"The top 10 fattest cities in the U.S. for 2024 include several southern cities that have long struggled with high obesity rates. The list is based on factors like the percentage of obese residents, access to healthy food, and levels of physical activity. Here’s a summary of the top cities:

	1.	McAllen, TX – Leads with the highest obesity rates and related health issues, like diabetes.
	2.	Shreveport-Bossier City, LA – Known for a lack of healthy food options, with many residents consuming high-calorie diets.
	3.	Birmingham, AL – A city where many rely on convenience stores for food, with over 31% of residents reporting no physical activity in the past month.
	4.	Memphis, TN – Notable for its Southern cuisine, with obesity affecting more than 37% of the population.
	5.	Mobile, AL – Struggling with both high obesity and diabetes rates, along with smoking prevalence.
	6.	Tulsa, OK – A newer entry to the list, Tulsa deals with issues of workplace wellness and poor dietary habits.
	7.	Knoxville, TN – High obesity rates and related health problems like diabetes and heart disease.
	8.	Toledo, OH – A city with one of the highest proportions of obese adults in the country.
	9.	Baton Rouge, LA – Known for high blood pressure and inactivity among its residents.
	10.	Augusta, GA – A classic southern city with limited vegetable consumption and high rates of overweight individuals.

"SEARCHiNG Any Potential Friendships (Racine, WI)👹🤠🔥


Hey there,
I’m a 26-year-old Mexican-American guy who recently landed in Racine after spending most of my life in Tijuana. Fluent in Spanish and English, I’m equal parts deep thinker, dark humor connoisseur, and someone who can find a laugh in almost any situation.

Lately, I’ve been feeling that disconnect that hits when old friendships fade and social media becomes just another reminder of who’s drifted away. I’m looking to shake that off and meet some new people IRL—especially folks around my age who don’t take life too seriously and are down for genuine, no-pressure connections.

A little about me: I love road trips, cooking, dancing, and singing (badly but enthusiastically). I also enjoy exploring random topics about life, society, or whatever absurd rabbit hole comes up in conversation. I’ve got an adventurous side too, whether it’s discovering hidden gems around town or checking out a cozy dive bar—though I’m currently living that sober life.

I’m also into gaming (NBA2K, FIFA) and tech concepts, so if you want to geek out over creative ideas, I’m all in. Coffee, a casual walk, brainstorming something cool—whatever works. Life’s too short not to take a shot at meeting new people and making solid connections.

So, if any of this resonates with you and you’re up for a hangout or just chatting to see if we click, hit me up. Let’s make it happen.

Cheers!",reddit,general madison

"Non-club informal book discussions Book clubs can be difficult to organize for several reasons: finding members, assembling a list of interesting and available books, setting a regular, convenient schedule and location. I suspect that there's a population of readers who haven't yet found what they're looking for through the existing, limited number of book clubs in the area. Perhaps your taste in books doesn't match what's available or popular. That's how I feel, anyway, and given the difficulties already mentioned, I don't think the solution is to create one additional book club on the traditional model.

Thus, my half-baked idea, if people are interested, is to create a new local subreddit to facilitate informal, random book discussions. If you're reading a book, about to read a book, or thinking about reading a book, you can just post it on the new subreddit, and if other people happen to be interested, then they can co-read the book with you, and afterward the readers can arrange, publicly or privately, to discuss the book at a time and place of their choosing, in a (probably) small group. Ideally this discussion would be in person, at a safe place such as a coffee shop or library, which is the point of having a local subreddit. The group could be as small as two people, which is not really viable for a book club but perfectly fine for an informal discussion of one book. I think it would be fun to meet and possibly make friends with people who have similar literary leanings. Discussing the book on the subreddit is also be a possibility, though, if nothing else works, or if the readers don't feel comfortable meeting.

What do you think? Is this idea half-empty-baked or half-fully-baked? I'm prepared for the proposal to be DOA, but I figured that I've give it a chance, because the alternative is, well, more of the same, i.e., nothing.",reddit,general madison

"Throwing out some random good food spots: 

\### Coffee

\* Johnson Public House: Serves Kin-Kin coffee, some of the local best, as well as some really solid food

\* Lake Street Coffee: Coffee here is less awesome, but the vibes are on point, they have a kitchen for food service, and there's tons of space and seating

\* Wildwood Cafe: this is outside of Madison (in Stoughton), and their serving size for food is on the smaller side, but it's a smaller cozy place with good food and coffee 



\### Asian

\* Hutong: bit of a fancier take on Asian cooking--it attracts a lot of Asians because the food is legitimately good

\* Niji: probably some of the better sushi in Madison; it's pretty decent for this area (but not to the standards of NY/Chicago/LA--it's also far out on the East side) 

\* Chen's Dumpling House: convenient because it's on State St--hole-in-the-wall style Asian food that's fairly reminiscent of street-style food in places like Flushing, NY



\### Brunch

\* Madison Sourdough: de-facto brunch mainstay in the area; their bread/baked goods are so good that a lot of local restaurants use their stuff 

\* Bradbury's: Close to the Square and servers some really solid breakfast food with both savory/sweet crepes--limited seating though

\* Lazy Jane's: Lots of seating with a variable menu--kind of in between white girl brunch and trucker diner food; they just have really solid brunch with gluten/vegan options too



\### Bakeries

\* Sweet Asian Bakery: Probably one of the few Asian-style bakeries comparable to Chicago/NY...there's a few other Asian bakeries in Global Market's food hall/State St that have similar offerings, but are overpriced/too fancy in comparison--this place is VERY good

\* Far Breton: they have weird hours and they sell out fairly quickly, but they have my vote for the best bakery in town, hands-down--just a bunch of delicious pastry concoctions (both savory/sweet), but they are a bit pricey

\* Batch Bakehouse: only went once so far, but they have a fairly solid selection of baked goods that were mostly delicious



\### Fancy Eating

\* Mintmark: my personal favorite for higher-end food choices; their menu changes pretty regularly and it's tapas-style small dishes (which are pricey), but I've always been impressed whenever I go here

\* Lallande: newer restaurant (1 year old-ish), and their food is very homey/simple French-inspired fare, but really tasty--I feel like I pick up new cooking ideas whenever I go there (protip--go for the bar counter seating for nice kitchen views)

"&gt;Maybe they should invest in some actual parking instead of taxing people

I’m confused. Who should invest in actual parking? The city? The city already has a bunch of parking garages that everybody subsidizes… through our taxes.  https://captimes.com/news/government/no-car-if-you-live-in-madison-you-still-pay-for-parking-downtown/article_b02c6189-b923-5366-9b6b-14e286ccf2ed.html

And who do you think pays for the parking that the city “invests” in? They should tax people who don’t drive instead of taxing the folks who are driving and violating the privilege they’ve been given to store their car on public property?

&gt;who have to street park for their 8 hour workday or have a rental without a driveway? 

Find a different spot and walk, take public transit and don’t worry about working, ride a bike, carpool, pay for the public resource you’re using? Madison has such an abundance of stupid cheap parking already but you need to be able to hog a public space for free for your convenience. Everybody should subsidize your privilege of owning a car.

BTW, you’re literally just being asked to move your car once a day. 

&gt;People park in the street because there’s no other option the city has been profiting off of the squeeze they’ve created with no interest in alleviating the problem.

There’s so much BS here to unpack I don’t even know where to begin. I disagree with the entire premise of your statement. What exactly is the “problem” you’ve identified here? 

Maybe you should educate yourself on the actual costs of parking. https://youtu.be/Akm7ik-H_7U?si=mgCRZbLNRa5-vgEm",reddit,downtown

"I agree with others who ask for more transparency from Woodman's about marking up prices.  I first noticed in 2020, when many people switched to delivery groceries. Pricing was not a consistent x% across the board - some items were same as in store price, and some were significantly increased, i.e. $2 markup on a loaf of brioche bread. Who has time to price compare your receipt to the same items in store? We experienced so much crazy cost inflation during pandemic so it was hard to notice at first. The $7+ load of brioche bread on my receipt was the red flag.  I couldn't believe it when I saw the more than $2 increase over the in-store price. There was a Woodman's employee in the bakery at the time so I asked him about it. He confirmed there is price mark up but could not offer any insight into why it's inconsistently applied.
I'm totally on board with paying for the convenience of delivered groceries, but just charge more for the service, or at the very least, tell people what you're doing.  There was nothing on the website or app that mentioned price markups for delivery.  Woodman's can add a xx% at checkout for shopping/delivery services?  It. Needs. To. Be. Transparent. or it feels deceiving.  I was a little crushed when I learned this and felt a little bit betrayed, ngl. Haven't used delivery from Woodman's since that day.

"*How do homeless people get FoodShare?* They start by walking in to the Department of Health Services (1 W. Wilson) or Dane County Job Center (1819 Aberg).   If they call 2-1-1 they'll find out how much the Capital Consortium can help them 888-794-5556. Most people end up applying through ACCESS ([English](https://access.wi.gov/s/?language=en_US)/[Spanish](https://access.wi.gov/s/?language=es)) using the computers at the Job Center.

*How many actually have FoodShare?* I got no stats on this, but anyone who has ID to buy booze and earns under 200%FPL ($2,510/mo for individuals) and is not a student is entitled to it. Some students are eligible, but that's beyond the scope of this post.

*What if homeless people lose their EBT card?* They walk into DHS and ask for a replacement card to be issued on the spot.

*What can you buy with FoodShare?* Anything that is food other than hot food, alcohol, or tobacco. Key items for homeless people will be sandwiches and frozen meals.

*Where can they use FoodShare to buy food?* Pretty much any supermarket as well as most multi-location convenience stores (Kwik Trip, 7-Eleven). All these locations offer a microwave oven so that customers can heat up their food. You may not have noticed them, but they are there.

*How do homeless people carry their groceries around with them?* Luckily, most homeless people are a notch sharper than you are. Buying a weeks-worth of groceries and carrying it around is a concept that *housed* people have. Homeless people buy only what they need for their next meal. If it is warm enough outside, they discard the packaging on the way out of the store and eat as they head down the street. If it is cold out, they eat at the supermarkets ""cafe seating"". That's the section of the supermarket with tables, seats, a microwave oven, and dispensers for disposable cutlery and napkins.

*Where do homeless people even find a supermarket downtown?* Capitol Center Food, Festival, Asian Midway, Fresh Market, even Target are sorta supermarkets too. Smaller stores that accept EBT downtown are Walgreens, Gordon Market, Regent St Mart, Sunrise, Pinkus, Fresh Madison, Dollar General, CVS, Capitol Center Mkt, Basset St Mkt, Stop 'n Shop. Farmers market accepts EBT.

*Where can homeless people who boycott capitalist businesses get a hot meal?* This is not current, but most of it is still valid [https://law.wisc.edu/newsletter-media/2019/6996-homeless-resources.pdf](https://law.wisc.edu/newsletter-media/2019/6996-homeless-resources.pdf) everyone is welcome, even **you** with that nice house.

"&gt; I knew WI had a per capita lead for bars, but there's a lead and then there's just, it's almost not a thing.

There's a classic map of bars to grocery stores - https://flowingdata.com/2014/05/29/bars-versus-grocery-stores-around-the-world/ ... and that kind of shows Wisconsin on the map.

However... note that that's got some visualization artifacts in it.  http://www.floatingsheep.org/2010/02/beer-belly-of-america.html

&gt; Rank	State	Bars per 10,000 Population  
&gt; 1	North Dakota	6.54  
&gt; 2	Montana	6.34  
&gt; 3	Wisconsin	5.88  
&gt; 4	South Dakota	4.73  
&gt; 5	Iowa	3.73  
&gt; 6	Nebraska	3.68  
&gt; 7	Wyoming	3.4  

This gets to a question (I believe) of population density.  Head outside a city (and there's a lot of Wisconsin that is outside a city) and you get the bar and church that serves an area where people gather... except that churches tend to be only open one day a week for their gathering.

Rural Wisconsin is at the ""right size"" for bars to be the most common [third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place).  For my parents, they're a 45 minute drive from the nearest grocery store (a Woodman's).  Going to the grocery store, you drive past two churches and three bars.

If the population density drops even lower, you get to the spot where you've got to go even further for a bar (or church).  If it takes more than say... 10-15 minutes to get to the local pub people don't go there.  Example: [Ashton, WI](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.1403092,-89.5401433,3a,75y,225.48h,90.87t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1swSP7U1DkhR1LcaGq_Cy7-g!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-0.8727900030563376%26panoid%3DwSP7U1DkhR1LcaGq_Cy7-g%26yaw%3D225.48348830271632!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOS4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDUzSAFQAw%3D%3D).

All I hear is Biden inflation and electric car mandates.  So I go on Facebook to confront their claims.  The first thing I ask then is for receipts or sources, over and over again.  Nobody has fulfilled those logical request to make an argument valid.  Go look at what they are reposting, the same garbage.  I look at who is the original poster, it looks suspicious.  Look again, a female Russia is posting questions to my uncle.  I ask my uncle why Russians are texting him.  He doesnt know.  I ask him if its perhaps due to him posting on Russian bot posts of unflattering democrat ideas.  While I am engaging with him, my feed is filling up with Russian bot posts, you know the US flag and the vet and the phrase why dont vets get college loans forgiven, along those line.   Look at the comments for those, i see ""Where did my country go????"".  I post to my family about my finding of Russia bots, nothing my white space.  

Over and over and over again i beg for them to post a web link even to a source of this how Trump did $1.80 gas and how Trump made food cheap, how Trump made the economy so much better, I get nothing.  I ask them respectfully to provide me with any information that could change my mind.  I even lead in saying i'm open to their opinion if they can provide something tangible.  

My grandma is the worse, she is the patriarch of misinfo.  All of her children parrot the exact same BS.  Chem trails chasing her, Bill Gates killing 20k people with polio vax, anything with owning the libs.  Her grand child is a big libs of tik tok guy visiting her a lot, not helping things.

Every post they make I have been following up with a logical response and requesting receipts, even to their memes.  This may take a while to deMAGAtize my family.  After my brother tried recruiting me to the MAGA cult with his immigration nonsense, which he couldnt support of course it was crickets when I pressed him on things, I decided to push back to regain the 75% fucking percent of my family with reality brain rot.",reddit,general madison
"What’s your favorite Wisconsin town in summer? I’ve had family in Wisconsin and my daughter is planning to attend school in Madison next year. We’ve been talking about it for sometime and I think we are wanting to pull the trigger on a cabin or lake cottage in Wisconsin. 

But I’m having trouble narrowing down my list. Obviously the whole state is beautiful, but I really want something within reasonable proximity to an airport and I’d like it to be kind of a sleepy summer town that we are either in or nearby. Last year I stated on Lake Winnebago and really liked it. I don’t really want to be in the city, but I don’t necessarily want to be completely rule either. I was hoping to find a nice town that might have a lot of seasonal visitors, but would still have the restaurant and the gas station and a grocery store.

So far I’ve been looking near the central Wisconsin airport and near Green Bay. I really like Wassau looking for other suggestions also",reddit,general madison

"Question for Rural Residents Okay, that's most of us here in Wisconsin, but I have a question for you.

We always hear that life in the rural areas is ""cheap, quiet, and has a higher quality"" to it. I don't know about you, but that isn't my experience.

What ways do we experience additional strains (or dare I call them ""taxes"") for existing outside a Metropolitan area?

Some examples from my area: We have no grocery store in my town, only a dollar store (pay more for food, no fresh foods). There's no specialist access for healthcare so you have to travel, but we have no transportation services for those without cars. Wages are stagnant and most jobs are part-time with no benefits. There was no ambulance available for a community member with a broken arm, they had a $60k helicopter ride instead.

My hope is to find better ways to explain in meetings that rural areas are still fighting for a level playing field when it comes to basic needs.

Or, if I'm super off, tell me! I'd love to hear your experience.

"Text of article from Milwaukee JS:

Plans for a Buc-ee’s convenience store between Madison and Wisconsin Dells include a $15 million Interstate 39/90/94 interchange upgrade — with Buc-ee’s asking to split the project costs between the company and taxpayers — and the request has made the timeline for the start of construction uncertain.

Buc-ee's is offering to spend up to $8.1 million to build a new Interstate 39/90/94 interchange in DeForest, in northern Dane County, according to a proposal to city officials. The new development is requested at the County V interchange, with the popular convenience store and other new development expected to dramatically increase traffic in the area.

DeForest Village Administrator Bill Chang said Wednesday that the funding proposal was a ""challenging number"" for the village, which is exploring funding through means like a tax improvement district.

The Buc-ee's site is outside of any current tax incremental financing district in the village, Chang said. The village is also hampered by a state law that limits its ability to grow a current tax incremental financing district or create a new one and include the Buc-ee's site, he said.

""It's a big ask, something that generally a community our size would not be prepared to take on,"" Chang said. ""(The tax improvement district) may be able to assist in public improvements. ... That's a policy decision for the village board.""

Negotiations will delay a construction start date that was initially planned for this summer, Chang said. He said that proposal was ""very early on in the process"" and that DeForest will have to conducts its own analysis of the Buc-ee's proposal.

Chang noted that the interchange, with an interstate and a county highway, is outside of the village jurisdiction, posing further funding questions.

""So the question is .... should the village take the full brunt of this?"" he said. ""There’s not, per se, a number that we’d be comfortable with. It just depends on who are all the players.""

Buc-ee’s announced the plans for its first Wisconsin location in early 2023, resulting in much excitement. Some of that is due to its sheer size and reputation — the 75,000-square-foot convenience store would have roughly 120 gas pumps, for instance, and it's expected to be a major hub for travel commerce.

The proposed cost-share agreement was discussed at a June 18 DeForest Village Board meeting in closed session. In an email, Chang said no action taken during or after the closed session.

Buc-ee’s has yet to submit an approval request for a site plan, a document that's greenlit by local authorities before authorization is given for construction. Chang said the financing for the infrastructure project would likely need to be settled before that occurs.

Buc-ee’s had previously told the Journal Sentinel that the company hoped to start construction this summer.

In a memo, Stan Beard, Buc-ee's director of real estate, wrote that the proposal is in line with the company’s agreements in other states “where the existing transportation infrastructure is not adequate for a Buc-ee’s.”

“The scenario obviously requires ‘others’ to participate in the remaining 46.33% of the cost,” Berard’s memo reads. “I have no doubt that the economic impact of this Buc-ee’s project will provide significant return of, and on, this investment for many years to come. We have too many examples of success to think otherwise.”

The Buc-ee’s memo details that a traffic analysis by engineering firm Kimley-Horn showed that 53.67% of the interchange’s total traffic volume would come from the convenience store by 2034.

The proposed interchange improvements would create a diverging diamond interchange, according to the memo. DeForest's Chang said that the Wisconsin Department of Transportation agrees that, if Buc-ee's were to come, that it would need the interchange upgrade.

The interstate corridor is under a Wisconsin Department of Transportation study and, without Buc-ee's development, is planned for less extensive updates.

“As a result of this work, the parties ultimately agreed that the Interchange Project is required for the operational integrity of the Buc-ee’s Project and anticipated future growth of the areas surrounding this intersection,” the Buc-ee’s memo reads.",reddit,deforest

I used to live in Madison (it’s my hometown but that’s besides the point). There was a coffee shop that was at 1748 Eagan Rd, before it was Mercie’s. It was called Cool Beans.

"Considering a Move to Madison – Which Neighborhood Should I Look Into? Hey Madison folks! I’m planning to relocate to your city and would love some input on which neighborhood to consider.

A little about me: I’m 28, single, and will be working in an office. I’ve lived in a major city my whole life and am looking for a change. I enjoy working out, live music, reading, cooking, hiking, and being in nature.

I’m looking for either an apartment or a house and am open to having roommates. I’ve seen that rent seems to be around the $800 range—is that accurate? I can pay more if needed, but I’d like to get a sense of the typical rent.

I’m unsure about living near parks or lakes, but I wouldn’t mind being in an active or lively area with access to nightlife, dining, and coffee shops (semi-important). Since Madison isn’t a huge city, I don’t imagine my commute will be long, as my office will be in the city.

"Housing ideas for me (55M) and my dog (3NM), arriving in December I'm moving to the Madison area in late December from metro Phoenix with my dog.  I grew up in Milwaukee, so my ears don't feel cold wind chills.  The weather in Madison and four seasons will be welcome change.  Not only has this summer been very hot, it's been four months of exactly the same weather every day without even the thunderstorms and dust storms the Sonoran Desert is supposed to have.

I am hoping we can find a small house or half a duplex or an end unit or something with outdoor space where we can play fetch during lunch.  It doesn't have to be huge, but larger than a typical apartment patio.  I work from home, so I like to wear out my dog for the afternoon.  A complex with a dog run might be OK.  I would expect Madisonians to be more midwestern nice and to have more animal sense than people here.  I would probably go up to $2300/mo if it was perfect.  I only need 1BR, but I could  justify a second bedroom for an office.  I would be OK with mowing the grass.  It was my first job.

I like all kinds of cycling, so the ideal location would have city-type things like a grocery store or coffee shop in easy walking or riding distance in one direction and country roads or mountain bike trails in the other.

Are there any utility gotchas around Madison?  Like one part of town with a bad ISP or something?  Neighborhood with icky water?  In metro Phoenix, there are two electric utilities: SRP and APS.  People love SRP and hate APS.  (And all the water is undrinkable.)

"It’s actually a much more complex story. It would take me too much time and space to explain just how bizarre the entire situation was.

The store is located 0.4 miles from the apartment complex and is at the intersection of two major state highways. Perfect location to operate human trafficking. 

The other issue I’ve noted is the lack of information regarding how trafficking operates. Are there middle-people? Does someone set up the pick-up location. Is someone else laundering money? I’ve asked national orgs these questions and they have no answer. Most information focuses on how to identify a possible victim.",reddit,general madison

Our son struggled with sitting still and focusing on the material on the screen tho. Also, I definitely felt a bit pressured when I initially reached out to them. Like they were friendly but they were selling pretty hard. 

Costs were about the same, for what we were getting in terms of sessions per week. It's all so dang expensive. $250/month for an hour a week. Not that the tutors time isn't valuable but it's definitely an amount where we had to spend some time deciding if it was worth it to us and how long we could make that investment.",reddit,east side
"I lived in this complex my first year in Madison. It's surprisingly easy to get into town, or visit the east or west side. It was a great location while I was getting to know the city. I went to the zoo and olin park every day. They are EXTREMELY dog friendly.",reddit,west side
"Walkable neighbourhoods in and around Madison area  We may be moving to Madison for the next few years while my partner completes her PhD work. She will need to go to campus daily, so we want to be relatively nearby, but the housing prices seem to be ridiculously overinflated on the isthmus. We’ve lived on Milwaukee’s upper east side for the last ten years and Riverwest, Brewers Hill and downtown Milwaukee before that. We prefer to live in urbanist-friendly neighbourhoods like the one we are in, where we rarely ever need to drive and have everything within walking distance, including beautiful Lake Park and Bradford Beach, which we bring our dog to every day. 

Other than when we need to go to IKEA or Trader Joe’s, everything we need is within walking distance: grocery stores, pharmacies, hair salons, bakeries, restaurants, cinemas, etc (although I have actually hiked to Trader Joe’s several times). It is pretty much fantastic and we love it. I’m sad to leave it behind but this educational opportunity is too good to turn down.

I’m not very familiar with Madison or the surrounding suburbs, but Milwaukee has some inner ring suburbs like Wauwatosa, Shorewood, Whitefish Bay and others that are not in the city but offer very walkable/bike-able/transit friendly areas to choose from with often more affordable homes. 
I know Madison doesn’t have a ton of suburbs but are any of them similar to this in that they have high walkability and density on “main street” type corridors? If not, what parts of Madison are like this (having a good sized park nearby is important for our dog)? 

We would also prefer to live in a SFH not a condo or apartment, as we like to garden too. 

Any help or guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.",reddit,downtown

"Opening paragraphs of the article:  
  
*Urban Triage CEO Brandi Grayson and other Black women in Madison say they have been targeted in a campaign of harassment from a group of white, mostly unelected men.* 

*Grayson, former Dane County Supervisor Dana Pellebon and east side alder Sabrina Madison told Madison365 that former Madison Common Council member and recent Common Council candidate Nino Amato, current Dane County Supervisor Jeff Weigand, and Madison resident Sean Burke have engaged in targeted harassment, racism, and “dangerous” behavior towards women of color in particular, and have worked to undermine the work of Urban Triage and discredit Grayson personally.* 

Later on Pellebon (former Dane County Exec candidate) says:

*“There’s nobody sitting around \[the County Board\] saying Brandi is not doing the job,” Pellebon said. “Nobody at the grant organizations she works with. Nobody is complaining about how the grants were administered. She passed multiple audits.”*

So far complaints about this non-profit have turned up nothing other than shouting matches at council meetings from one disgruntled constituent and complaints about salary, to which the article says:

*Madison365 examined publicly available records of 73 nonprofit organizations currently contracted to provide human services for Dane County. Grayson’s salary is higher than the $198,000 average; however, those organizations spend, on average, more than 7% of their budget on executive compensation. At 2.9%, Urban Triage’s spending on executive salaries is relatively low.*",reddit,east side

3. The Farmers Markets on Saturday morning. They are so much more than just a market, between the music and art vendors, and the coffee shops, and a stop at my favorite book store, they make a wonderful Saturday Morning.   
4. Under the Oak concerts at Twisted Grounds on the far east side, I just started going to these last year and they have some really good musicians! Every Friday and Sunday, I don't know how they find that much good talent!  
5. The food cart nights at Garver feedmill. These just started recently too. But it's a good vibe, good crowd and usually music.  And it's on the bike path!  
6. oh, and number 6.  Last year I started going to pizza night at Giant Jones Brewery. It's on Wednesdays, you can order in pizza, they open the outdoor area.  It's such a good vibe too. It might not be as big as some of the other events, but it's become one of my favorite things in the summer.

"How do adults make new friends? I'm a 25-year-old who just moved to Madison less than a week ago and I don't know anyone here yet. The city is absolutely beautiful, with so many people running, biking, sailing, or simply enjoying a walk. It's a bit disheartening not to have any friends here to share in these activities. So far, the only people I've interacted with are my co-workers, but they all seem busy with their own lives and families.

This brings me to my question: how do adults make new friends?

I'd love to learn sailing or biking, find charming coffee spots around the city, or just relax by the dock and watch sunsets. I know it's okay to do these things alone, but I'd really love to meet people and share these experiences. Any suggestions or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",reddit,general madison

"oh I can relate to this entirely! And ramble away!!!  
I kinda mentally split my book shopping into two categories.   
  
1) Am I buying it off my TBR?  If I am, I don't even try to pick it up at a book store anymore, it put in my order at my local bookstore and patiently wait for it to arrive :) It was hard to shift to that at first, there's a gratification getting the book you want in two days, or going to one of the bigger stores, walking the isles and checking it off the TBR and taking it home. But it's been years now since I've done that, and I've found that once I got used to it, the satisfaction of supporting my local independent bookstores and doing my little part to contribute to this community outweighs getting the book quickly. I'll give a small plug for Arcadia and Lake City Books.  They both make it super easy to order online Between those two I've been able to find 90% of the books I've wanted for at least the last 5 years.   
  
2) Or... am I in the area and is there a little wiggle room left in my self imposed book buying budget (which lets be honest, if way more flexibly than it should be)  In which case I'll browse the shelves, knowing I probably won't find something on my TBR (but I might, so it's worth checking). Then switch over to reading the back covers and checking out the staff recommendations. It's a little more chaotic, but I've found so many books this way I wouldn't have run across otherwise. Also... just being a little bit of a grumpy old lady here... I've been led astray with booktok over-hype way too much recently. Looking back at my ratings list, I have better luck just putting my trust in booksellers at my favorite stores. 

I don't think you're doing it wrong though, I don't' know if you can do book shopping wrong - unless you're not allowing time for coffee and little treats? that might be wrong -  very very wrong :P

Right out of college I was on the west side for a couple years near Midvale/Tokay in a newer apartment complex, which wasn't as enjoyable. The neighborhood was nice enough to walk and run in and there were a couple businesses near us.

A few years ago I moved to the near-east side around Atwood. This time we found a spot where we rent one level of a house. It feels much more homey to me.

Being so close to grocery (shoutout Jenny St Market), restaurants, and many other random shops is a game changer for me.  
I rarely use my car now. I got a bike, and either that or the bus can get me to almost anywhere I need to go around town.

"Mounds Pet Food Warehouse closing stores but opening others One of the oldest and largest locally owned pet supply store companies in the Madison area is closing three stores but opening two others.

Mounds Pet Food Warehouse has announced that it will close its Fitchburg store on May 18 and its Middleton store on May 25. But it plans to open another store in the former Buy Buy Baby space near Target on Junction Road on June 1.

And the Mounds store next to Farm &amp; Fleet on Stoughton Road is set to close sometime in July, with a new store opening Aug. 1 in a former Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond store at 4275 Lien Road in East Prairie Commons.

The new East Side location for Mounds will offer more amenities than its other stores, with services like grooming, dog day care and a self-service dog-washing station, said Kelsey Hocker, Mounds’ marketing manager.

“We’re combining into more central locations that will be more convenient for our customers,” Hocker said. “In general, Madison is full of pet lovers, so it’s a competitive market.”

The new store on Madison’s Far West Side will be a bit smaller than the new East Side location, which is why expanded services are not being offered on Junction Road, which combines the Fitchburg and Middleton operations. The Fitchburg store has had its visibility and access drastically reduced following the expansion of Highway 18-151.

"Seeking Friendly Cleaning Service Hello!

I (30f) am seeking a one-time service to help deep clean my home. I’m a disabled former first responder, who, between a spinal break in 2019 paired with depression and PTSD, struggles to keep my house clean. I’m mobile now, and I do tidy regularly, but having owned our home for coming up on three years, I’ve FINALLY managed to budget for a service as I don’t have friends or family to reliably assist me.

I’m looking for a service that will help me wash base boards, floors, dust, move furniture to clean behind it, that sort of thing. My house just really needs a deep refresh, and my inability to do it myself has been weighing heavily on my mental health.

My in-laws are visiting in three weeks and I’d ideally like to schedule the cleaning before their arrival.

Do you have any recommendations for services in the area? I’ve never personally hired a cleaning service before because it’s never been necessary or within my budget before.

I will pay especially well for compassionate service, as I feel a lot of irrational shame over the state of the house. (It’s realistically not that bad - but it’s hard not to feel like this is a personal failing)

Much love to you fall, hope this post finds you in good health and good spirits.

I’m located on the near west side, the house is a 3 bedroom, 3 bath (but it’s smaller than it sounds)",reddit,east washington

The security code had been scratched off and the last 4 digits of the card had been scratched off.  The balances show zero.  I have my receipts but Target can't really do anything about it.  Contacting the customer support for the prepaid card was a joke.  An hour and a half later they told me they would open a claim and it could take 20 days to resolve after I fill out the paperwork in the email (which I never received).  If the claim is approved it could take up to 90 days to get a refund.  Are there any other options.

Also, nearly the entire country is behind on building housing. Even if Madison kept up with the current demand, it wouldn't be enough because we're so behind from the great recession and housing crash. 

I don't understand why redditors are under the impression that Madison isn't really building housing. I see new housing being built pretty much every month when I drive into the city.

"No, it’s not even close to the second coldest city. Come on. The key is to embrace the seasons changing. They all have some great elements if you get out there. True winter is more like two months of snow and cold. Yes, the days are shorter. Get a good winter jacket, a hat, some winter hiking boots and gloves. Head for a winter hike on any of the many trails in or near Madison. The peace of the snow-muffled sounds, crystalline snow, looking at critter tracks is beautiful. Try your hand at snow shoeing or cross country skiing. Coming home to a vat of chili bubbling in a crock pot and settle in for a snow storm. This is how you avoid seasonal depression. I’ve forced myself to embrace it and now I really look forward to winter. Also, to be fair, I always book a week somewhere warm and sunny in February.

March and early April can be tough as it can be gray and rainy, but then the leaves start to pop and the migratory birds start showing up. Spring brings highs in the 50’s and 60’s before transitioning to 70’s and 80’s in summer through September. The humidity is not as bad as Austin. 

Honestly, I don’t see much shutting down when (many) of the students are gone in summer. Traffic is lower, but other things open up. Madison hosts the country’s biggest local farmer’s market, so pick up amazing veggies, cheese, breads and more. Visit any of the many breweries hosting bands and food trucks.  Head to Lake Michigan, an hour or so drive, to cool off on beautiful beaches. Or take a long weekend in Door County, driving between sunsets on the Bay and crashing waves on the lake side and eating every cherry pie in the county. 

Fall is amazing. Warm days, cool nights. Leaves changing, football games, bonfires. 

Now for the other side: Madison offers a lot of music, though there is no way it matches Austin. One issue for some people is the lack of late-night restaurants, so if being able to eat past midnight on a Tuesday is important, you don’t have a lot of options. It is growing rapidly, so housing is tight. It’s probably not great if you are politically conservative (but if you are, we’ll help you see the light! 😄).",reddit,general madison

"Dog Rehoming Hi All,

After trying everything both we and a number of professionals have thought of to resolve our dog Percy’s issues, my wife and I have made the very difficult choice to re-home her. Percy (short for Persephone) suffers from terrible anxiety and has not responded to any of the medications or training we’ve given her. She’s generally restless until late at night and then again for at least an hour in the middle of the night. She’s currently on a regimen of Gabapentin and L-Theanine, but we haven’t really seen any efficacy there either. Aside from medications, we exercise her regularly either with long hikes or time at the dog park, but those things also seem to make no difference in how the night goes. To make things yet more difficult, when she is in her depressed/anxious state, she is completely apathetic to any external positive stimuli such as treats, food, or praise, making her nearly impossible to train. We’ve also gone to both a professional trainer and to a behavior-focused vet, and both told us we’d tried everything they would recommend and that re-homing her does seem to be the best idea for both her and us, unfortunate as that is. We tried so SO hard to make this work for her and us, and it really does break our hearts to come to this after so much work and love went into it. We do currently have her listed on Home to Home via Underdog Pet Rescue, but she’s been up for a month with no traction. Given her issues, we do not believe (and our vet agrees) that a shelter environment would be good for her.

I know that we’ve made her sound like a nightmare of a dog, but deep down she’s a very sweet girl who just wants to be loved. We’re not sure what caused it, but she clearly isn’t comfortable in our home and we don’t think she ever will be at this point. We truly believe that she would do well in a quiet, secluded (aka set back from the road) home as the only pet. She’s fine with all sorts of people, although is a little cautious at first. Percy is an almost two year old Collie/Poodle/Bernese Mountain Dog mix, so there’s plenty of working dog energy to get out each day. She absolutely loves fetch and could play for hours on end before getting tired, and enjoys winding down with a cream cheese filled lick mat at the end of the day.

If you know or are someone who is willing to take her on either in a foster setting or permanently, please send a DM. All we want to do is make her happy in any way possible. Thanks for your time.",reddit,general madison

"I started the trip in mid August of 2019. Went up to the twin cities, then my next general goal was Badlands National Park in central South Dakota. From there, I set my sights on Grand Teton and Yellowstone, up through Montana, and then took highway 20 —otherwise known as the North Cascades Highway— all the way across Washington to the town of Anacortes. Hopped around the San Juan Islands for a week, did a lap clockwise around the Olympic peninsula, then took the ferry from Bainbridge Island right into Seattle. Spent a few days exploring the city, visiting museums and such, before continuing down towards Portland Oregon and on down the coast.  It ended up taking me exactly two months from Madison to when I first laid eyes on saltwater in Anacortes. I encountered some snow in Yellowstone in mid to late September, which was a continuing battle through Montana.

Overall, it was an AMAZING time. Highs and lows for sure, and I'm not just talking about the mountains, but the highlights more than made up for the struggles. Most people who cycle across the northern US go west to east because that's the way the prevailing winds blow across the great plains. From the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains, it's all uphill and against the wind. I found South Dakota to be *much* harder than Wyoming in pretty much every way, but still don't underestimate the latter. Western Montana is GORGEOUS. Most of the roads are in river valleys tucked between the mountains, so the elevation actually wasn't terrible. Missoula is a fun town. If you're familiar with the Adventure Cycling Association, they're headquartered in Missoula. Stop by their office while you're in town. 

Highway 20 across Washington State was recommended to me by a Seattle resident I met in Badlands who's also a cyclist. Riding that road involved climbing five mountain passes in as many days, and it was absolutely worth it. Only surpassed by my recent travels to Alaska, the North Cascades was my favorite place on Earth in terms of natural beauty. 

Aside from your route? I always tell people new to the world bicycle touring —and apologies if you're already more experienced with this than I assume— that the absolute highlight of my trip were the people I met along my way, every single one of whom wanted to be a positive part of my story in whatever way they were able. Many incredibly kind locals opened their homes to me for a night, providing me a soft bed, warm shower, and their wonderful company over a delicious home cooked dinner. Drivers would see me stopped on a desolate Wyoming road and they'd pull over to offer an extra bottle of water when I was a million miles from the next town. Neighbors in the next campsite over, after seeing me arrive on [my monster of a bike,](https://np.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/s/oMdJyjVloJ) would come over to ask about my travels. I'd give them a summary of where I'd come from and where I was going, and they would invite me to join them around their fire to exchange their food and beer for my stories. My favorite quote comes from a kid's cartoon show: ""while it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing."" It probably goes without saying that daring to ride a bicycle across much of a continent was the chapter of my life in which I believed in myself more than I ever had before or since. It was also the time I relied most on the help of others, and I truly was blessed to have experienced that. 

All that to say, you're gonna have a story people will want to hear. I'd encourage you to make it your first instinct to say yes to any opportunity to spend a few minutes with those people.",reddit,general madison

"I grew up in Edgerton (home of Steve Stricker and Sterling North) so I can tell you a few things. 

First and foremost, it’s a small town and small town boredom is very real there. Aside from a few parades and Chilimania (chili festival) there isn’t much to do except drink, drink, and drink. 2 brothers has some pretty damn decent food though. Billy Ray Cyrus did perform at Chilimania a few years ago. Used to be a big tobacco town. Most people living there have been living there for AGES, lots don’t pass the small town test (you pass the test by LEAVING).

Secondly, their school system doesn’t “suck” but it’s not very diverse since the town itself isn’t diverse. Growing up in their school system I (white) recognized and witnessed how the black and other POC students were treated differently. Ain’t that just America though? Nothing overtly racist (except some kids with their confederate flags attached to their trucks). Mostly passive racism I suppose, NIMBY type people, definitely not bad like some small towns in the south. Plenty of white people there own old images/figures of mammy-type stereotypes. 

Like most smaller towns, it’s mostly white people doing white people things eating white people food. If you’re white and you’re trying to raise a family and you don’t want to expose your children to other types of people it’s perfect for you! Fairly safe too, I was out and about past curfew plenty of times growing up and had no issues. If you like Doctor who, there’s a house in town that has a TARDIS in their yard (you’ll have to find it yourself) Lots of drugs since there’s nothing to do. I have had a few classmates die to overdose and other tragic events since graduation, which was not too long ago for me. 

The cops there are small town cops, so they are SUPER bored. If they can find a reason to pull you over they will, no matter how small. My father was pulled over 2 times in a row once because of a busted headlight, he was just trying to get home from a local gas station. Same thing happened to me trying to ride my bike home late at night. 

Ultimately it’s not the worst I suppose, it’s safe. I bet the cost of living isn’t horrible either. But it sure ain’t amazing. I was so happy to leave once I graduated, I SKEEDADDLED as fast as I could. They do LOVE to point out their “world’s largest Culver’s” as many times as they can.

"I’m a few weeks late but gonna hop in anyways. We’re in a pretty similar spot - I’m in my twenties and currently living in Monroe, soon to move out. I couldn’t agree more w everyone else here basically saying there’s fuck-all to do in Monroe. I wouldn’t recommend living in one of the in between towns like New Glarus or Belleville. They’re cute and I’ve been to both, but they are TINY and have almost nothing. At least Monroe, as the center of all commerce in a 45 minute direction each way, there are several good gyms, a Walmart, fast food places, and in general restaurants some of which stay open til 9 or 10. You will be super bored here. However, I’m actually going to encourage you to take the job. 

Now, bear with me here. I’m working at the place you will work in all likelihood - they’re the only gig in town basically, and definitely the only one recruiting talent from outside of Green County. I’m from a small town that’s a suburb of a medium sized city on the east coast and Monroe feels absolutely TINY. While it’s technically bigger than where I grew up, the fact there’s nothing in every direction makes it feel super remote. Madison is cute and nice - not a very large, bustling, or diverse city, and any friends you make there will all work at Epic. But it’s passable. What I’ve done is used my time in Monroe to further my career, applying to jobs and working towards a better resume/portfolio/etc on the many, quiet nights. I’ve lived modestly in a tiny apartment and saved up a decent nest egg. And now, I’m using that nest egg to move to a larger city and a job I care about more, as having some good work experience put me ahead of my peers in the entry level job market.  

It is an option to live in Madison and travel. If you do take the job you’ll find about half of the folks at the company do it. But 45 minutes is an understatement, it’s really a good hour if you’re anywhere in Madison other than verona or the west side (both very pricey). Living in Madison is of course an option but the folks at work who do always seem to dread the hour long commute. Not to mention once you hit green county (where Monroe is) the snow clearing services are shit and the drive is often unsafe. Personally I wouldn’t want to wake up at 5 am every morning just to rest my head at night in Madison instead of Monroe, and the money spent on gas would be crazy. But that’s up to you. 

Also if the job says it’s some WFH and it’s at colony… spoiler, every employee gets like 12 WFH days a year, unless you’re in a department that doesn’t rly enforce it. So I wouldn’t count on that at all.

I’d recommend you take the job, use it to bolster your career, work on self improvement and save up some money for six months or a year. Make a little nest egg that can grow in a high yield savings account and be your cushion for the rest of your life.

"Anyone Have Experience with Heritage Tavern as a Wedding Caterer? Hey All, I am working on planning a wedding and was working on food vendors. I've mainly been looking at ""The Knot"" and ""Wedding Wire"" for reviews of different vendors. However, Heritage Catering (the sister company of Heritage Tavern) doesn't have much of a presence on either. They only have 4 reviews on The Knot, and aren't even listed on the Wedding Wire. 


They are one of the preferred vendors on my Venue's list, and I really like the restaurant, but the lack of reviews is worrying, especially since they are quite pricy. 


So hopefully someone here has had recent experience working with them or enjoying their food at a wedding you've attended? Any discussion helps, thanks y'all.",reddit,general madison

"Breakfast places are often a great restaurant prospect—the margins on ingredients are better than any other meal and you get the alcohol sales on weekend brunch. Short Stack is a few blocks away from Marigold, which shows no signs of struggles as a breakfast/lunch spot, only open 7-3, doing great business. People will pay a lot for a good breakfast. 

Short Stack has always had some issues in their business plan (being open 24/4/late night gets rid of the advantage of limited hours for staffing and operating purposes; super high rent for a space that they didn’t manage well; shitty coffee and never getting an espresso machine, which also has strong margins) and compared to Marigold, the food was boring and lacked vision. I think they’d have done better not to have a counter model and just have well trained servers who kept tables moving, and their interior design did not maximize the space.

"The east side because geography, what makes Madison unique and charming is the Isthmus and it's forced density, and if you look at a map 80% of the Isthmus is east of the capital and the 20% of West is really campus.   So the west side is more sprawling and less compact.  When your on the Isthmus it's just more walkable and bikeable because much of it is 8 to 10 blocks wide and that is the short side of the block too. 

Also since the city sprung up from the capital outward the closer to the capital the older the urban design and we all know urban design just got worse over the years.   So the east side has that denser less car centric design or more of it because again much of that design on the west side is campus and becomes much more SFH and strip mall suburban feel.   Yeah the east side has that but it's further out.   I feel like Olbrich is the dividing line where you see the city change.   

So that's why for me the east side is the best side, it's the side that has the Madison uniqueness, so many of the best restaurants and bars, and parks, etc...   the west does have really great neighborhoods too and restaurants but just less condensed.",reddit,campus

"Do Madisonians generally dislike driving? I moved here a couple of years ago and am loving Madison so far. The people are so friendly! This is not a dig against Madisonians, just something I’ve noticed that I find a little quirky - not sure if it’s representative of the general population or not. 

Many of the people I’ve met here seem to dislike driving. I can’t blame them, as I also try to minimize the amount of time that I spend in my car - but they seem to prioritize driving/commute distance over all other factors. Here are 3 interactions I’ve had just this month:

1. I needed to get my nails done before a wedding, in which I was a bridesmaid. I looked online and found a few places. One was about a 5 minute drive from my apartment, but had poor reviews. Another had great reviews and was about 15 minutes away. I went to the further one, and struck up a conversation with the nail tech and the woman next to me. She asked where on the West Side I lived - when I told her that I actually lived in Fitchburg, she was shocked! She couldn’t believe that I had come “all the way” to the salon. I told her that the drive was only 15 minutes, to which she said that she would never drive “more than a few” minutes for an errand, “no matter how bad the reviews are.” The nail tech seemed surprised that I had come from Fitchburg, as well. 

2. My insurance changed, and I was in need of a new primary care doctor. Once again, I wanted a place that had great reviews (for obvious reasons). I ended up picking one about 12 minutes from my apartment. When I was filling out my onboarding paperwork, the lady at the front counter was shocked that I lived “so far away.” 

3. I went to pick up my prescription from a pharmacy about 10 minutes from my apartment, but that was on my way home from work. When I arrived to pick it up and confirmed my address, the pharmacy worker asked me “What are you doing all the way over here?” I told him that the pharmacy was on my way home from work, but he still seemed skeptical. 

I should add that I’m far from a fast driver, so it’s not like the distances are actually further than I think. I just find this really unusual, and want to know - am I the weird one here? Do Madisonians hate driving/traveling more than a few minutes for errands? Or did I just happen to have a string of funny coincidences? I welcome your input!",reddit,west side

 If you do have to go out, plan to leave early to brush off your car,  check to see if your car starts(would recommend getting a portable car jumper so you don't need another car to jump yours) and drive slow on the roads.

So we do the holidays as a couple, and try to make it good. 

\* Lots of sitting in coffee shops and bars downtown watching people come and go, ideally if it's snowing. Great Dane and all of King street is great for this. Garth's Beer Bar on Monroe too, and their sour game is on point. 

\* Hike a bit in the late fall prairie, it's kind-of brutally dead, just waiting for snow, but if you need to get grounded, to quiet the soul, just go and embrace it. It's the cycle of life, the cycle of nature, the resting period before the cold, which leads to the explosion of green and flowers in the spring. Pheasant Branch and Badger Prairie are great for this, and even the Prairie Moraine Dog Park is too. Go for a hike and pet some dogs. It's amazing. 

\* There are tons and tons of live music events. All genres, from christmas music to metal shows. Sometimes it's nice just to get out into a giant crowd of people jamming to someone bringing down the house. Hit some holiday music at Overature, for sure. 

\* It will cost you a solid $100+, but swing into Fairchild and belly up to the bar, and treat yourself to a stunning meal. They've got 4 (?) bar seats that they don't take reservations for. Their Old Fashioned is life changing. Go experience food on a level you might not even know exists. 

\* Check the capital concert schedule and get a nice leaning spot on a railing upstairs. They do a bunch of things, tuba christmas, local orchestras, choral groups, etc. Pair that with lunch somewhere around the square, a dip into a coffee shop, etc. 

\* Go sample cheese at Fromagination. 

\* Cook some fancy shit. Go buy some stuff you might not normally cook with, and spend some time making yourself some awesome food. Have you made a pozole? White wine and garlic steamed clams with an herb-lemon-cream sauce and linguine? [Carbonnade à la Flamande](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/carbonnade-la-flamande-flemish-beef-stew)? Make some bread. Make a pizza. 

\*  Grab a book and go to Olbrich and spend an hour or two reading in the conservatory. Then coffee, lunch, or drinks somewhere along Atwood/Willy st. 

\* Go be a nerd. All the game stores run game nights, and it's all about teaching people how to play new games. Even if you don't end up liking the game or even the people, you'll at least kill some dark time being around people excited about something. That can be really nice.

There's a bomb food truck outside I/O on weekends that sells burgers and churros til late night. If you're looking for bar food, Mickey's Tavern serves til 10 and Argus on the square til 10 on weekdays and midnight fri-sat. Just a few options :) but you're right, more is always better, especially during the weekdays.",reddit,capitol square
"&gt;I’ve seen that rent seems to be around the $800 range—is that accurate?

No, it isn't. Depending upon what neighborhood you're in, studios could easily be going for twice that. You said you're open to roommates, which may be a necessity.

Depending upon how major a city you came from, Madison's amenities may feel very lacking to you. The neighborhood most aligned with what interests you will be downtown. Unsurprisingly, this neighborhood is also very expensive. I'd recommend seeing if you can find a place that's near a major transit line (specifically, the A bus line will likely give you the best results) that can get you downtown for the best night life. 

As far as food goes, Madison punches above its weight, but restaurants are probably not as diverse nor open as late as you'd hope. Late night options never fully recovered from COVID.",reddit,downtown

"Brother, let me give you the low down on Madison.

**Beware the Midwest Nice.** The white people here are, for the most part, nice and polite.  But, don't get it twisted: these white folks aren't going to invite you over to their house to break bread or get to know you other than the superficial ""Where are you from?"".  

**Few amenities**.  You looking for a get a nice line up, fade, or getting locs?  There's not many choices here.  You looking to go to the bar and listen to some hip hop or R&amp;B? Can't do that because many business owners have clauses in their leases that forbid the playing of black music.  Because, you know, listening to Pharrell's *Happy* or Mariah Carey's *Honey* may cause us go into a berserker's rage and riot /s.  Over time, you'll feel culturally isolated and the cultural isolation is a feature, not a bug of the city.

**Read this Reddit at your Peril.**  If you continue reading this forum, you'll find out what the people here actually think of the people who look like you. The white folks here blame every possible thing from crime to education on black people.  They've ran out the black superintendent and black police chief and are working on ousting the black district attorney because reasons.  You'll also find that that the city ran out the a black-owned business - That BBQ Joint - because white folks who lived near his business didn't like the smell of meat.  If you think I am bullshitting you, look [here](https://tonemadison.com/articles/ribs-on-notice-the-that-bbq-joint-controversy/).  Needless to say, the brother shuttered his business and now works for UW.  To keep you up to date, this particular sub is at war with national award-winning black chocolatier. Her crime?  Opening a GoFundMe to expand her business.  If you think I am bullshitting you, look here.   

**No late food options**.  You know in other city at 1 am or 2 am, you can get a late-night snack or a food truck.  Madison has nothing like that.  The people who live here (because don't know any better) believe they get better late-night eating options at Kwik Trip (this is nothing but a gas station) than an actual establishment or food truck.  You'll notice that you see no food trucks, it's because white folks made food trucks illegal outside downtown campus.  

  
In general, Madison manages to have the worst of a big *and* small city.   It has the cons of the small city: restrictive zoning, businesses closing down at 9 pm, not a lot of late-food options.  It also has the cons of a big city: lots of traffic, noise pollution, high rents and house prices. The people here are stuck in the past, pining for some nostalgic version of Madison that will never come back which is why rents and mortgages have stayed where they want them: high as hell. What keeps me here is the fact that I do like my job, I am treated well by my organization, valued for my work, get paid reasonably well, and I have excellent benefits. The healthcare in Madison is also excellent.  But, I wouldn't be lying if I said I was happy here and counting the many, many years to 55 so I can early retire and move somewhere that brings me joy.

In any case, good luck (because you'll need it).   Feel free to DM if you want more information or link up.",reddit,downtown

"I grew up in Oregon, went to a graduated from OHS, and frequently visit my mom who still lives there. It’s a place to live, really, and that’s about it. There is no night life, Firefly’s new owners are not the kindest form what I’ve heard from friends and families, but the food and drinks are still good (go to Kickback Cafe instead) but it sucks because I LOVED the place growing up. The restaurants are okay, best places for food though have always been Maria’s, Moonstar, and Headquarters. It’s a super super family orientated town, and is more conservative than Madison. Grew up next to the gated community where students and their parents are snobs who look down on anyone not in their community (despite everyone i mean literally everyone knowing the code to the gates). There are some really friendly and good people in Oregon, but growing up there left a bitter taste in my mouth. JL Richard’s is AWESOME and has great lunch specials. Main Tap is a local spot for decades and has great burgers and beer. It’s also nice being right in between Madison and the other suburbs like Verona, Stoughton, and Fitchburg. Because oregon lacks in social activities and spots, the accessibility makes up for it a lot. Every weekend we would drive to see friends in neighboring towns or to Madison; we didn’t stick around Oregon much honestly. My family moved there in 2002 and enjoyed it for the most part. It’s a good place for families and living not in Madison but being okay with a commute. I hate visiting the town though lol it’s just depressing. I rarely see others from my class there too, and when I do see people they’re not thrilled to be there visiting either. 😅 But if you don’t want to live in the hustle and bustle of it all in the city, it’s an okay place to live. I will warn you though if you smoke at all, OPD has so little to do they’ll make it a priority. They will also sit in certain areas at the end of the month to collect their quota which is annoying, so just watch your driving (: They do have a nice bike path on the edge of town, and the dog parks are nice too. They’ve added some stoplights which is 10 years too late but grateful, also got a Tabby o’Jacks for pets!! There’s been some good additions to the town.
I want to piggyback off someone who mentioned the referendums and school; YES agreed! As someone who watched and saw the construction to OHS, I was so confused why they added a second gym and weight room when we are pulling mold out of the paint in the art rooms. Athletics suck except for soccer, they go to state all the time. Just seems like they’re investing in things that don’t benefit the rest of the student body of community. The school was also very okay ish. Bullying is not addressed, or wasn’t when I was there, and educationally it’s very mid. It’s also a SUPER white place, my brother had a kid in his class only be suspended after literally h—ging his fake BIPOC baby for health class. Not progressive at all, and not the most comfortable. 
It’s a place to live, sleep, eat. That’s about it.",reddit,fitchburg
"First off it's weird you are arguing my experience but ok here we go.

- Never said it was exclusive but we are much more than downtown.  You can pretty much walk from Atwood to vilus and never leave mixed use walkable neighborhoods.  Again pretty much the entire isthmus and that is unique.  Milwaukee and many cities like it will have small sections of their cities, 5 blocks or so like that then you get into residential only areas, or commercial only.  It's the massive amount of neighborhoods like that all together that is different.  And I'm not saying we are the only city in America that has that but very few of any especially in our size do.  
- if you feel people to be cold here that's on you.  Again everywhere I go strangers talk to me.  I'm in the twin cities right now been out every night and not once in 3 days has it happened.  I lived in chi6for 10 years and it was rare, Milwaukee for 3, used to go to Denver once a year for work, rarely happened there, go to California quite a bit, rare there.  
- We do have more spaces like the union, in fact we have the other terrace, you have union south, garver, olbrich beer garden, etc...  
- So you are comparing states to one small city for food?  Weird take.
- I said outside rent, I acknowledged it was high but cost of living is more than rent and the cost of living outside of rent in Madison is low.  There are calcutors where you can compare cities.  
- not just underground parking but most our parking downtown is in ramps which is way more efficient than just flat lots wasting valuable space.
- on flying costs, yes it's more expensive to fly out of Madison but often when I calculate the cost of going to and from Chicago it evens out but also I can get off a plane in Madison, be out of the airport in under 5 mins and be home 10 mins after that and there is value to that.  Last time I had to fly out of Chicago it took me over an hour just to get to my car and then 2 more hours home.  After a long flight I would definitely pay a premium to just be home.  

Other things

- national average is 61% stay where they graduated college, UW Madison is 62%.  So wrong.
-yeah our neighbors bars and hard to beat
- every city has outskirts and they all suck.  
- covid really hurt the late night food scene but it's coming back
- Not every college town has a state street, this is when you showed your hand of just an anti Madison clown.  First off there are very few pedestrian streets in all of America and not all are even attached to colleges.  
- Ived lived in a few states and yes the drinking culture is different here, Illinois is nowhere close, Minnesota isn't close.  Statwise it isn't close.
- 9pm law is good, we have too much drunk driving as it is. People going for beer runs at midnight is usually because they ran out which means they shouldn't be driving.  Stock up better, I haven't had an issue with that since before I was 21.  Usually we start and go to the bars.  
- first off like all cities Madison is surrounded by suburbs.  What do you want out of a small city for it to turn into a big city?  This is a weird ass point.  But it's also wrong, 40 mins away is devils lake or the dells or the other 12 amazing state parks or great hiking, local farms for apple orchards, or pumpkin patches, wineries, some amazing country town bars, more lakes.  I love where Madison is, again surrounded by some amazing nature, cool small towns not far (Columbus Antique Mall anyone?), and 1 hour from Milwaukee, 2 hours from Chicago, 4 hours from the twin cities.  It's amazingly located.  
- the roads on the isthmus are actually kinda great, mostly one ways makes a city way more walkable because you don't have to cross as many lanes and you can still effectively move traffic.  East wash is the worst of it but they are making improvements.  Also everyone has GPS now.",reddit,downtown
I really enjoy the prime rib (Saturdays) at the Glarner Stube in New Glarus. They typically don’t take reservations so you have to go early and put your name in.

"Need an awesome mobile mechanic? Dustin is your guy! I'm from out of town and recent post lung transplant patient. I have no clue who in town to trust for towing or mechanic work on the fly and has good turnaround for basic repairs. My alternator went out and vehicle stranded in my hotel parking lot. I went through an online mobile mechanic agency because even digging through this sub wasn't coming up with reliable answers. The agency I paid turned out to be trash but they connected me with a mechanic, Dustin. He was awesome with getting the part, inspecting the serpentine belt to make sure I didn't need a replacement from wear, tear, or flat spotting/melting from when the alternator failed. Showed me some other issues hard to find if it wasn't for this repair as well while telling me scams that shops may try to pull while inspecting that part. I'm a former nuclear power plant operator and maintenance tech, as well as a digital media comms specialist. I've done quite a bit of car work of my own and know my way around them quite well (I knew my alternator was bad from only a few symptoms while driving home and before I got a battery light). Now I have my vehicle back and I can get my groceries and exchange my video rentals back a Four Star Video.

Dustin is your man if you need a mobile mechanic. I told him I'd give him a positive shout since most only talk when it's negative.  Text (608) 692-2889 as he's getting calls from various people and contracting agencies and it's easier for him to keep track and get back to anyone right now.

Walgreens's pharmacy is a shitshow every time we go. They seem to be chronically short-staffed, and a simple pickup usually takes far too long.

That said, Madison is a small-medium sized city, so we've got tons of pharmacies.

"I can't speak to Monroe more than folks here have already, but I can speak to small town vs city. 

I grew up in a town smaller than Monroe, and it had a lot of pros and cons. The big pros are that in small towns, everyone knows everyone, and if you ever need help, people you know are around to help. Neighbors help neighbors all the time. 

But what I didn't realize growing up as a kid was how limited so my opportunities were. It spans the gamut from entertainment to food options to different cultures to networking for jobs to educational opportunities to recreation options, health care, shopping, etc., etc.

Cheap living and short work commute, but the downside is if you're going to a concert or something, you might have a very late night drive home. You can live closer to Madison, to let you access more of what Madison has to offer easier. The downside is you're driving all the time, to and from work, and to and from Madison. You can live west side of Madison and commute to Monroe. That's likely the worst of all worlds, as the cost of renting will be super high, and you'll be on an hour drive each way, and my guess is that whatever you're doing for work in Monroe won't pay what a Madison salary might offer.

This may be entirely NOT the fault of the stores once produce gets to each store, I don't know, I simply know the end result when I'm looking at the produce on the retail floor. It had long been my presumption that how Woodman's does their produce supply chain is simply longer (seemingly much longer, I'd guess at least a day and a half) than other retailers. This isn't isolated to one store, and it's not only the peppers.  

So for over 2+ decades I've simply shopped elsewhere for produce, no sense wasting my time hen picking produce to try and find something that looks fresh.

Quite frankly this project lacks not only a market survey but also definition. Right now it sounds like a few indoor food carts plus some crafts.

"Ok, sorry, I love Woodman’s and shop there all the time with no intention of stopping, but literally everywhere has less mold than them. Pick n Save is a trash grocery store, for example, and I used to go there occasionally before I started boycotting them over labor issues. 

They CRUSH Woodman’s in produce quality. Not selection, but, specifically, mold frequency. By a lot. So, while you might be right about the difficulty of distribution, I’m still confused about how Woodman’s can be SO MUCH worse than a dogshit store like Pick n Save.",reddit,general madison

As for the area, the Kwik trip was built down the road after I moved out but it’s nice that it’s over there now. Fish hatchery road will be where your closest grocery store, coffee shop, and couple of restaurants are. I did really like the walking/bike paths in the area. The subdivision across the street has tennis and basketball courts and a bunch of different paths to walk around in. Otherwise it’s a pretty quiet area. Not a ton of businesses. 

The train tracks are directly behind the building so I would recommend picking a unit that faces the parking lot but not that many trains roll through and it’s usually during the day. Also the fire station is right near by but I never noticed the sirens much.

"yeah, exactly, that's what I'm saying. I am particularly aware of this, I live in a 110 year old house on the isthmus :P

###**On the geography point:** 

If we took the built up parts of our town and copy-pasted it over different geography, my neighborhood would've almost certainly been bulldozed to make room for an ugly urban freeway and parking lots some time in the 60s or 70s. Madison would look like Columbus [where downtown is an impenetrable castle with 8 lanes of high-speed traffic in all directions as a moat defending a moonscape of parking lots opening huge clear-cut concrete lines of sight between skyscrapers nobody wants to be in](https://images.axios.com/BTepbG9P7KUlYlY01K-E4wJ4DC4=/0x45:1329x792/1920x1080/2023/04/12/1681318991421.png?w=3840), smelly and smoggy and hot and loud and ugly and full of auto glass and tire fragments. 

But because we have our geography, building a highway through downtown would mean occupying basically the entire width of the isthmus. There wouldn't be anywhere left for the city to go. So it was very obviously a uniquely bad idea here, despite the promises of the [mid-century auto-utopian images](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Futurama_diorama_detail.jpg) being pushed by car and oil companies that everybody else fell for.

###**On the zoning point:**

As nifty as it is to live in one, it's pretty self-evident that houses in cities shouldn't really be around in the same form for over 100 years. When a city is growing, the land should pick up different uses as the needs of the community change. A lot of the houses on the isthmus, including mine, should have been replaced by now with denser and more varied purposes. 

For example, my house is on a corner in an area that was (until the recent completion of a corporate megaproject) a bit of a food desert. If I was feeling enterprising and had access to a few hundred k in cash or loans, I might decide to replace my house with a corner grocery. The neighborhood needs one, and I don't really like gardening so my backyard is wasted on me. My lot is a prime location: on a corner right in the middle of a neighborhood, not far from a school. While I'm at it I would probably put 1-3 floors of apartments on top, maybe live in one and rent the others. [Something like this](https://ehq-production-canada.imgix.net/8e99a9b5c3a7d7b7f21e4de60a1590a0047dc1a0/original/1693975814/e1c1bf528bd7f9e74c306baa4b651af8_blob?1693975814-unsplash--undefined&amp;auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;w=1080). This kind of development is the natural next step for a neighborhood like mine, you see it all over the world in places without zoning, including older neighborhoods of Madison that started this transition before zoning was introduced. 

But I can't do that, no matter how good of an idea it would be, no matter how much everyone in the neighborhood would love being able to walk or bike to get groceries instead of driving 20 minutes to a supermarket, because in 1966 the all-knowing wizards of the Madison City Council set down an iron law that from that moment until the end of time my corner lot within walking distance of downtown must always have a little house and a big lawn unless somebody lobbies and argues and gets the majority of a future council to pass a new ordinance that says otherwise. That level of micromanagement from a city government is historically and internationally weird. It's not how cities normally develop and grow. It's stunted our infrastructure growth and we are paying for it in the form of an exponentially worsening supply crunch and skyrocketing prices.",reddit,downtown
"Yeah, parking is a major consideration anywhere from the stadium through capitol, to a few blocks east of the capitol. If your partner is commuting and parking, you really need to figure that piece out, as it's likely going to cross off a lot of places to live. 

One car vs two is an issue, as is whether or not you can/want to street park. Lots of places require street parking, or they only have space for one car. If you're in that situation, you might want to strongly consider your bus options, because that will give you the ability to get out and about while your partner is away. 

FWIW, I lived near the west transfer point for grad school, and it was pretty good. There's dining and groceries and a coffee place within walking distance.

"Seeking the best neighborhoods for a young professional in Madison Not familiar with Madison at all, so I apologize in advanced for the broad question. Trying to learn about the best neighborhoods for a young female professional to consider apartments in Madison. Key factors (in no particular order) are:

1. Safety for a single, young female (more inclined to larger buildings with secure, covered parking)
2. Don't want to hang-out with college kids
3. Good access to restaurants, museums, parks, interesting things to do
4. Good access to grocery store, pharmacy
5. Good opportunities for walks nearby - by water, trails, parks, etc.

"Planning on moving to the area...a few questions! I grew up in the Midwest—Clear Lake, Iowa, to be exact. I’ve moved around quite a bit since middle school and now find myself living in Texas… much to my dismay. I’m working on changing that, though, and my heart is set on Madison.

What’s really drawing me in is the local Jewish community—something *severely* lacking here in the middle of nowhere, Texas. On top of that, everything I’ve researched suggests Madison is not actively hostile toward LGBT folks or those with more liberal leanings. That’s a huge deal for me, especially considering where I live now has a very visible and open presence of the KKK and white nationalists. It’s beyond alarming.

I also just really miss the Midwest. I miss Midwestern hospitality. A lot of people talk about how charming and hospitable Southerners are, but in my experience, it’s been the opposite. I miss fried cheese curds, hotdish, and even the brutal winters—I was *not* built for this southern heat and humidity.

So, here’s the real point of my post: I’m open to living in a small town near Madison if that helps make this move possible. I’m disabled, and my husband is a restaurant manager for a national pizza chain. He’s been with them for 13 years, so finding a similar job up there shouldn’t be too hard.

We’re not wealthy and unfortunately have no savings right now. Where are the most affordable places to rent a house in or around Madison? I’m also trying to convince my mom to come with us and escape this place while the housing market is still within reach. That could give us a little more financial wiggle room.

But assuming it’s just me, my husband, and our pets making the move, we bring in about $3,700–$4,000 a month. I know Clear Lake-style rent prices (like $600–$1,000 a month for a 3-bedroom farmhouse, depending on timing) are probably unrealistic near Madison—but maybe not if we’re willing to go a bit farther out?

"Sell the golf courses  This came up in a recent thread about the City budget. 

The City of Madison operates four municipal golf courses: 

- Monona (9 holes)
- Yahara Hills (36 holes currently, with a reduction to 18 in coming years as half the space was sold to Dane County for landfill expansion) 
- Odana Hills (18 holes) 
- The Glen (9 holes) 

There are also another 5-10 private golf courses in Dane County, plus full service driving ranges at Pinseekers and Vitense, and a host of new virtual driving range bars like Hook and Fade, Blind Shot, and two X-Golf locations. 

Given the abundance of opportunities for golfers, more than ever before, the four city courses seem like an absolutely absurd amount of land devoted to a passtime for a tiny fraction of residents. Especially considering the constant concern around access to housing and parks.

While the costs to participate are probably pretty modest at municipal golf compared to private courses, these courses have run at a defecit at times, and require Parks Department staff time as well as MPD response for security. Why are we subsidizing the costs of golf, limiting the use of this land for the majority of people behind course fees and extreme grass damage concerns, using a ton of water and pesticides to maintain fairways and greens, and keeping valuable land from being developed in line with our growing needs? 

I would propose that TWO of the courses be put into a planning process for development and ultimately parcels would be sold and built upon. The City has control to design the areas to include green spaces, trees, public parks, wetlands, or drainage areas. Not every square inch would need to be buildings. The overhead view of these spaces will show just how much land we are talking about.

Specifically, the Monona course takes up a massive block on the super valuable Monona Drive thoroughfare. The Odana Hills course exists in another extremely desirable place to live. If the city demanded multi-story condos be built in either area, it would be meet a huge need. These two courses should be developed. 

This idea would STILL retain 27 holes of municipal golf on the far east and near west sides, which seems like an abundantly fair compromise for the people who are attached to the history of those courses. While access is important, golfers aren't walking up to the courses or riding public transit with their bag of clubs. They're driving. So there's no reason they can't drive to another nearby course. 

Frankly, selling them all doesn't seem unreasonable, but keeping some should quiet any concerns. There's just so many other places to golf now, Madison doesn't need to keep wasting valuable land in the face of all it's other obligations. While this won't resolve the 2025 budget crisis, it still should be put into motion sooner than later.",reddit,west side
"What Do You Do When the Agencies Who Are Supposed To Protect You Are Part of the Problem, Here in Madison? I'm desperate, and I don't know where else to go at this point, so I'm starting here.

I live in a building downtown, 2 blocks from the Capitol and 1 block from State Street. It's for senior citizens and disabled persons. I've lived here 5 years, and it has been a wonderful place for all of us. But something sinister has come into the building in the last few months, and it's spreading like a virus.

A pimp/drug manufacturer and dealer moved in with his “girlfriend.” He’s not even on the lease, but she is. He controls her and at least the women in 2 other apartments. It's not rocket science to figure out how this happens: He gets one of them hooked on crack and then he owns them. And then they prostitute for him. He also has ""muscle"" on his ""staff,"" a guy who hangs around outside the building and in the lobby. This problem will certainly continue to spread like a virus in the building. He also runs a drug trade, letting all kinds of potentially dangerous people into the building. He's even made key fobs for his family members. The stairwells are heavily littered with garbage, crack pipe remnants, and urine, all since the pimp moved in. 

We're all afraid to live here now.

Lots of residents know what's going on, the ***real*** staff here also knows. Their management company and the building owners also know. The problem is they're afraid to do anything about it because they're afraid that the **Madison Tenants Resource Center** and the **EDDP (Eviction Diversion and Defense Partnership)** will sic their lawyers on them if they try to evict anyone involved in this. 

Now this fear of the MTRC and the EDDP didn't just come out of nowhere. There has to be a reason why landlords fear them so much, even to the point where they will put the rest of their tenants in danger because they're afraid to kick out the bad ones!! ***The MTRC and the EDDP are part of the problem!*** 

Whether they would or wouldn't defend the crack whores and their pimp doesn't matter because the fear of them getting in the way of landlords evicting bad/dangerous tenants is very, very real. BTW, the pimp is still here even though he's not on any lease because he is their ""EMOTIONAL SUPPORT COACH.""  The MTRC and the EDDP are certainly valuable for tenants who have ***legitimate*** problems. But, it seems that they've also created an environment where they've possibly overexerted their influence/authority, and landlords put the safety of their good tenants at risk because they fear the MTRC and the EDDP.

"Question about Petition for Summary Assignment with Special Administration regarding small estate after father's death Hi, Im looking for a bit of advice regarding the settlement of my fathers' estate. The back story is my sibling and I have been estranged from our father for 30 years, He's been divorced from our mom for 32 years, and his 2nd wife passed away before him. He passed in 2020. He had no will and we recently learned there is a small amount of money in his estate(less than $25K). He had a friend who provided some care ""at no charge"" while our father was living in an assisted living facility after he suffered a stroke. Things like helping him pick out and set up some furniture, picking up some groceries, taking him places from time to time. We were told a couple years ago about the estate and the friend said he'd contacted a lawyer to assist in finalizing the estate. The lawyer took some time to get back to him(so we've been told). We recently received a request to consent to appointment as personal representative and that we agree to assign him our inheritance expectancy as payment for helping our dad out. We feel he's been repaid in that he either kept or sold any furniture-TV, chair, bed, etc. He did offer us the items, but we declined. 

My sibling and I do not want to agree to giving him the estate, as we are heirs, the money should go to us based on Wisconsin law. We don't know where to go from here. Do we need a lawyer? Do we contact the lawyer who sent the document and tell them we don't agree? No one in our family has dealt with this issue, so we don't know what our next steps should be.

"Tips for Moving From SoFlo to Madison Appreciated Hey everyone, i’m potentially moving to Madison in the middle of next year from the metropolitan Miami area (born / raised ) and have some questions for anybody who has been in my shoes. I’ve searched this reddit and everything i’ve found is kind of outdated (1+ year old).

First, environment. What’re the differences in landscape, nature, weather? Miami is very flat and hot/humid year round. Barely any nature within the city, you gotta travel to the Everglades or further up north to see any actual “nature” but then you can’t really enjoy it cuz of how HUMID it is while you walk around imo. Great beaches but no natural springs or lakes like the two lakes surround Madison. Do those get used for recreational purposes or are there other lakes that do get used? 

Second, culture. if you’re a hispanic where I’m from, you’re basically in the majority. there’s a latin bakery in almost every shopping plaza and you can’t get around without knowing at least a bit of spanish. I know Miami is as hispanic as you can get so I do know there will be a shift in culture but how much of a shift should i expect? Also, 50% of the random interactions I have here are rude. People are assholes in Miami (especially on the road). Is this the same over in Madison? Everybody i know over here tells me it will be a MAJOR culture shock (e. g. from what i’ve gathered in my research, are there really 0 latin american restaurants in the entire city?) However i’ve never known anything other than Miami so I have nothing to relate it to. On the flip side, I’d also like to know what the “culture” is like there. What do Wisconsinians consider “heritage”? 

Third, Housing. I plan to live on my own or with a roommate if necessary to keep rent under $1300 (even less if possible). For a studio/1 BD 1 BA  OR 2 BD 2 BA (split rent) is this feasible? I want to try subletting as I dont plan on staying for longer than 6 months at a time. Is finding a place to sublet in the fall as easy as it is finding one in the Spring? 

Lastly, Cost of Living. How expensive is everything compared to Miami? Going out in miami is insanely expensive you’re spending at least $25 on yourself on dining out at a restaurant and any drinks at bars/clubs are $15-$20. Ive heard groceries and car insurance is cheaper in Madison but anything else notable? 

I know this is a LOADED question so an answer to any of the parts would be appreciated. Also, any other tips or advice that you believe could be helpful is welcome. TIA!",reddit,general madison

Hello Madisonians..I live in the Atwood neighborhood and I saw and heard all of the police activity last night involving the hit and runs, stolen gun and weed. Does anyone know if there are any updates or how I would find updates? I tried searching Madison news sites and the Madison PD website and didn't see anything. Thanks!",reddit,atwood

"Transfer Back? Hi everyone, I am making this post because I am in a big dilemma and would like some advice/insight.

I attended UW-Madison my freshman year but transferred to a school on the west coast my sophomore year because it was my dream school. I am from the Bay I always wanted to live in LA because I thought it was all famous and glam and could help me live a perfect life, but boy was a sooo wrong. Since going, I have experienced such a great culture shock. I have never lived in a big city so the amount of crime and homeless people really made me have to be super cautious of my surroundings and just on alert mode anywhere I went no matter the time. I have found it a lot harder to make genuine friends here or at least ones that I can fully be myself around. Everyone seems to be so into looks, and to some point it has gotten to me. Over the year, I have tried my best to put myself out there, join clubs, do extracurriculars, and be an active student, like go to parties, take trips to cute coffee shops, etc., but I still feel so alone and like no matter how hard I try to have fun, I just don't feel like it is for me. I constantly feel unsafe, alone, and sad. This year has probably been the most unhappy I have ever been, and I am generally a really happy person.

At UW l I rarely felt this way. Of course I have my fair share of feeling alone in college no matter where I am, but never to this level I have felt at my current school. I know that my current school has so many opportunities, but I guess I have not really experienced these either. I applied to so many internships, but all rejected. Maybe it is because of my resume, and the name can only get me so far, but idk. Maybe I am not taking full advantage of what they give me, but part of me thinks that it is so hard to take advantage of stuff given to you from some place you just don't care about. And that's how I feel, I don't really care for school. I would only go back because people think it's good, but not for my well being. It's so hard.

Madison felt like home. But what if it is not any better if I go back? Will Madison make it harder to land jobs on the West Coast compared to my current school? How is the alumni network? Is it worth all the effort to go back? I applied back and got into the B school, and I want to double major with Data Science if its possible. So I am debating on whether I should go back or not. Would I be crazy to do that? idk... has anyone ever had this feeling before?",reddit,general madison
"Protestors? Did anyone encounter the sign holders at the East Washington and Hwy 30 intersection yesterday during the evening commute?  I saw the ""Honk"" signs but didn't catch what they wanted people to Honk for or about.  BTW I didn't hear any honking going on.",reddit,east washington

"The people in this sub that blame the GOP for refusing the border bill haven't actually read the bill and only listened to the media outlets that blame Republicans. 

The GOP voted down the ""deal"" because the crap democrats slipped into it. The bill actually allowed up to 5000 illegal immigrants into the country daily before the DHS had the authority to shut down the border. The democrats also added another 95 billion dollars (that we dont have) to Ukraine in this bill. Somebody, please explain why ANY foreign aid was inserted into a bill to secure our border.  

And, of course, the MSM reporting purposely left these details out.  Sorry, but the GOP rightly voted no to this, and the neverending reckless government spending by the Democrats. 

The reality is that all Biden needs to do is reinstate the remain in Mexico policy that was in place that he eliminated on his first day in office. He also could order the wall construction to be resumed with materials that have already been bought and are on site. He refuses to do either. Biden also eliminated DNA testing being done by border patrol. This is important because when it was being done, it showed that 30% of the children traveling with adults were of no relation which children are being trafficked across the border. Why in the world would Biden issue an executive order stopping this? 

There should be no ""deal"" to secure our border. Full stop. The border crisis as it currently stands is 100% Bidens fault, and he alone has the authority to fix it. Why hasn't he?",reddit,general madison
"Simple search would have done you well. None of these items should have been in this bill. NONE! These items should have been presented and voted on separately. No wonder why there is so much strife between the parties.
