It\u2019s easy to miss the beers ofNoble Roots Brewing Companyon Madison shelves. The small Green Bay brewery makes only about 750 barrels a year. That\u2019s not a lot even to supply Green Bay, yet co-owner Alex Falish, a UW-Madison grad, calls distributing to Madison \u201ca passion project.\u201d Falish and his father, Marvin, started the brewery after venturing into homebrewing together nearly 20 years ago. Falish tries to make the trip to Madison to distribute every six or seven weeks toGarth\u2019s Brew Bar, theLongtable Beer CafeandBarleyPop Tap and Shop, often with new releases. The brewery\u2019s Strict Observance, a Belgian tripel, recently caught my eye. It has musty, fruity Belgian yeast character that\u2019s sweet at the start, yet finishes dry and warm at 9.5% ($15/four-pack). Noble Roots takes special pride in its Belgian releases. \u201cOur area of Wisconsin is known for Belgian settlement and people here like those styles,\u201d says Falish. Noble Roots also makes Kermis, a Belgian dubbel originally created for the local Belgian heritage festival. Among the brewery\u2019s core offerings is Mackinac Island Amber ($13/four-pack). That brown ale has been offered since the brewery opened in 2017 and is among its flagship brews. It\u2019s made with orange peel, which lends a sharp tropical fruitiness to the dry-hot spicy kick of ginger. In February, Falish has three new beers headed for Madison. Alpine Folly is a cold IPA with assertive tropical flavor from Citra, Mandarina Bavaria and Sorachi Ace hops, and ends up at 6% ABV. If you like the German dunkles bock style, watch for The Goatman\u2019s Oath. It has floral sweetness and finishes warm at 6.6% ABV. And, just in time for the height of bock season, there\u2019s Winnie\u2019s Honey Bock, made with additions of honey and finishing at 6.8% ABV. These latest beers are packaged in 16-ounce cans and four-packs ($13). Note: The weather does affect Falish\u2019s ability to make it to Madison. More beer news:Delta Beer Lab and Vintage Brewing were recently paired up by random drawing in the Madison Area Craft Beverage Producers\u2019 Blind Date program that matches local breweries, cideries and distilleries and asks them to create unique limited releases in time for Valentine\u2019s Day. Crews from both breweries were at Delta\u2019s brewhouse in early January for a joint brewday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been wanting to make a Baltic porter and never have, so when Vintage offered some malts that would work well, it all came together,\u201d says Delta's Tim Piotrowski. A Baltic porter is a robust dark beer made with a porter recipe and fermented cold with lager yeast. Watch for it on tap at both breweries beginning Feb. 14. A big beer to trywhile it\u2019s still winter isBroken Bat Brewing Company\u2019s762* (a.k.a.

The Mariner\u2019s Inn site in the town of Westport will be redeveloped with multi-unit housing including space for a first-floor, waterfront dining space. The developer is McFarland-based Lakestone Properties. The units are planned as apartments. The concept for the restaurant is being left open for the time being, says Becca Gentilli, a real estate advisor on the project. It could be a supper club, a chef-driven project or something else that fits the site, near where the Yahara River enters Lake Mendota and close to many marinas. The developers are open to whatever cuisine or style seems a good fit for the location. Outdoor seating and dedicated docks for boaters who want to come for a meal via the water are also planned. The residential development fits the nautical look and feel of Mariner\u2019s Cove at Lighthouse Bay, the current condo development nearby. Lakestone Properties already has Lakestone Marina operating near the property. The Mariner\u2019s Inn was opened in 1966 and was operated by the von Rutenberg Family for 59 years. It was famous for its cozy, nautical-themed bar, steaks and seafood, and hash brown potatoes. The von Rutenbergs also operated Betty Lou Cruises, a dining and lake-tour business, from a dock at the site, and the Nau-Ti-Gal, a more casual dining room and bar, across Westport Road\u00a0but also on the Yahara. The Nau-Ti-Gal closed in 2022; the Mariner\u2019s Inn followed in August 2025, as family members retired. Gentilli says that dining choices \u201care minimal\u201d in the area and there are a large number of residential units nearby. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s out of the way, but it's smack dab in the middle of all of these other communities,\u201d says Gentilli, including north Madison, Middleton, Waunakee and Westport. The Mariner\u2019s Inn had solid numbers, she says, so \u201cit made sense that another restaurant would do well there.\u201d There\u2019s also boat traffic, she adds, and a relatively small number of area restaurants on the lakes. The project is projected to be complete in spring 2027, Gentilli says. byLinda Falkenstein January 14, 2026 1:10 PM Development in an estuary is asking for trouble, especially if it depends on risky un-natural lake levels, or costly and eco-damaging dredging.

The venerable Esquire Club, bought by Craig Spaulding in 2024, closed suddenly in March, but previous owner John Kavanaugh stepped in to re-open the restaurant.

Friends Applaud will be located at 1602 Gilson St. in Madison\u2019s Bay Creek neighborhood, tucked between South Park Street and John Nolen Drive. The space was formerly Black Rose Blending Co. and, before that, Funk Factory Geuzeria \u2014 specialty beer taprooms with bar-style layouts. The space needs to be renovated to function as a restaurant; first, by installing a kitchen. The couple will appear before Madison\u2019s Alcohol License Review Committee on Dec. 17 for liquor license approval, and then begin discussions with the city\u2019s fire and health departments to learn what kitchen appliances are allowed in the space. That decision will ultimately determine the menu, Adam said, noting that he has lots of ideas. \u201cI like all types of great food, I\u2019m very flexible with it,\u201d he said. Updates to the indoor and outdoor seating and decor are also in the works, and Adam plans to redesign and construct the space on his own. They hope to open in March 2026. \u201cAdam has amazing illustrations, from seating to what\u2019s going on the walls, to colors and materials,\u201d Sacha said. Sacha, who is Swedish, wants to infuse Friends Applaud withmysigt, an adjective the Swedish use to describe feelings of coziness, warmth and relaxation. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about the environment and the feeling that it brings,\u201d said Sacha. \u201cThat includes cozy furniture, colors and lighting; the warmth of the space, and the feeling of being at ease or at home. We are striving to make it asmysigtas possible.\u201d A woman gestured to the small indoor seating space and asked how many patrons they expect to seat. \u201cI have New York sensibilities about space,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI believe we can sit 40 in here comfortably.\u201d Though the menu is undetermined, the couple hinted at a few items they hope to share, including p\u00e3o de queijo (Brazilian cheese bread), raclette (cheese that is melted in its wheel and paired with breads, vegetables and meats), Sabine salad (a weekly rotation of specialty salads, named after Sacha\u2019s sister, Sabine), pudding and pasta. Adam envisions his homemade pasta being dried and displayed in the glass cooler near the entrance of the space. Adam was a waiter and manager at Restaurant Magnus and ran for sheriff of Dane County in 2002. He moved from Madison in 2007, traveled a bit, and then moved to New York, where he met Sacha and managed the restaurant Jeffery\u2019s Grocery. The couple relocated to Portland, Oregon, for a few years, but decided to move back to Madison during the pandemic. The day after they moved, Sacha said, Adam was online looking for restaurant spaces to rent. Adam is also a poet and a world traveller and his experiences around the globe have influenced his culinary tastes. The name for the restaurant, Friends Applaud, draws inspiration from what is widely believed to have been Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s last words: \u201cApplaud friends, the comedy is over.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re really excited to be in this part of the neighborhood, in this part of Madison,\u201d said Adam. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be creating something new.\u201d byLauren Hafeman December 11, 2025 4:30 PM Good to see something new is this space!

Giant Jones Brewing Company\u2019s superpower has long been strong beers with lots of flavor \u2014 barleywines, IPAs, double stouts and big Belgians. But until recently, brewmaster Jessica Jones has been reluctant to dive into barrel-aging, in part because of the storage space it requires. The brewery, at Main and Brearly, is already crowded. These beers may age a year or more, and barrels cannot be easily moved once full. But, Jones says, barrel-aging was \u201cone more itch to scratch, and I knew I would become obsessed with it.\u201d She loves how barrel-aging adds complex layers of wood and spirit flavor, especially to bigger beers. A chance to create something new and different with John Mleziva, founder of nearby State Line Distillery, prompted her entry into barrel-aging. Mleziva initially offered a single oak barrel for Jones to experiment with. The barrel was from the distillery\u2019s first batch of single malt whiskey in 2023. \u201cI couldn\u2019t pass up that barrel and the opportunity to do this with John. This is about neighborhood collaboration,\u201d says Jones, who employs only State Line\u2019s used wooden barrels for aging. Apple Photos Clean Up Someone To Someone: a barrel-aged Belgian-style stout. Their first attempt was a strong ale, similar to a Scotch ale, released in March 2024. It was followed by an Adambier (an old German style of ale) run through the same barrel. Those pilot efforts fostered bigger ideas. Currently available is a ryewine, aged in State Line brandy barrels, spicy and bready from the rye, and warm with apple liqueur sweetness. At 10.2% ABV, it makes for a great nightcap (500 mL bottles / $10). Someone To Someone, a barrel-aged Belgian-style stout, is fermented with a Belgian yeast and barrel-aged for a year. The beer was divided into different barrels that had been used to make aquavit, rum, peated whiskey and apple brandy respectively. Once aged, the beer was all blended back together \u2014 and the flavor begins with the anise aroma of aquavit, followed by dark, fruity notes from the Belgian yeast and the rich roasted malts of the underlying stout. The rum, brandy and whiskey barrels lend hints of spirit sweetness and light woodiness. It finishes at 10.2% ABV (500 ML bottles / $9). The beer\u2019s name comes from the album of the same name by the all-acoustic quartet from Chicago called PlainsPeak, a favorite of brewery owners Jessica and Erika Jones. A challenge in barrel-aging for Giant Jones is its commitment to being a certified organic brewery. Because State Line\u2019s spirits are not MOSA Certified Organic, Jones calls the first beer from the barrels \u201cmade with organic ingredients.\u201d If Jones uses the same barrels a second time it can be labeled as MOSA Certified Organic. Giant Jones will release four more barrel-aged beers at the brewery\u2019s upcoming Barrel-Aged Fest, Jan. 9-10. That event also features other barrel-aged beers from Madison breweries. Later in 2026, Giant Jones will release two more barrel-aged gems: its Belgian quadruple from rum barrels, and its Grand Porter, aged in rye whiskey barrels. byRobin Shepard December 7, 2025 7:00 AM", "date": "2025-12-07", "author": "byRobin Shepard", "section": "food-drink", "location": "general madison", "source": "isthmus"}

But owner Nia Ryan, who\u00a0was \u201cnever willing to let it go,\u201d has now teamed up with Lauren Virnoche, owner ofEcotone Herbs. Ecotone manages several farm fields in northern Illinois and southwestern Wisconsin, and Virnoche supplied herbs and fruits to the Herbiery before it took its temporary hiatus. \u201cHaving a partner with the same interest in herbs made me want to continue,\u201d says Ryan. The taproom looks the same but its beers and menu have been changed. Ryan and Virnoche collaborated with Madison\u2019sDelta Beer Labon what may become Herbiery\u2019s new flagship beer, a farmhouse ale called Field and Forage made with yarrow, creeping charlie, flaked oats and rye berries. It is a bright hazy yellow and carries a soft subtle fruitiness, woody herbaceous notes, and finishes at just 5% ABV. The beer has a clear range of flavors with an overall earthiness that leans into the name Field and Forage. Field and Forage will also function as a base beer to which different combinations of herbs, flowers and spices will be added. Currently, one of those variants is made with elderflowers and lemon balm; another has ginger grass and nettles. Ryan is also experimenting, at least temporarily, with a limited version of Field and Forage made with Saaz hops, along with hemp and conifer tips. These variants are available in the Herbiery taproom and make interesting side-by-side taste comparisons ($7/glass; 16-ounce cans will appear in early October). Other changes include house-brewed kombucha and herbal teas. There is also a limited food menu that changes based on what\u2019s available in local markets.

Biergarten season has arrived. Since 2020\u2019s COVID restrictions forced creative solutions, outside seating at breweries and brewpubs has become a staple. But what separates run-of-the-mill outdoor seating from something approaching the spirit of a real German biergarten? A biergarten is not a few tables on the sidewalk with a view of traffic. A biergarten is an atmospheric achievement. It is an outdoor space with a communal vibe. Its sense of place is as distinctive as a public park. They are family- and pet-friendly. Live music is a plus. Sometimes, if there\u2019s no onsite kitchen, patrons can bring in food, and these days, food trucks often line up nearby.

Tyranena Brewing Companyat 1025 Owen St. in Lake Mills has a sprawling lawn where folks spread blankets and settle in with a beer to listen tolive musicon Fridays and Saturdays in the summer. There\u2019s also a covered porch and patio seating \u2014 a safe harbor when poor weather sets in. The backyard feel. coupled with the quality music and beer, makes the trip to charming Lake Mills worth taking. About 15 beers are on tap. Pick:Lake Millionaire, a hazy IPA, has crisp tropical citrus flavor. You might know this place as the Wisconsin Brewing Company, but since WBC acquired Lake Louie in 2019, that branding has come to the fore.Lake Louie Brewing, at 1079 American Way in Verona, has a large patio overlooking a seven-acre man-made lake they call Lake Louie (though it\u2019s not the body of water in Arena that originally gave the brewery its name). The patio is home to special events, parties andmusicon Fridays and Saturdays (and some other days) during the summer. There are 13 taps. Pick:Pier Pressure, a new beer for Lake Louie. This is a light crisp pilsner dry-hopped with German Spalt hops that lend spicy herbal bitterness. There\u2019s no brewery attached toThe Biergarten at Olbrich Park, 3527 Atwood Ave. \u2014 but there\u2019s plenty of great brews on the almost-exclusively-Wisconsin craft beer tap list. The view of Lake Monona and the skyline is unsurpassed; the tables are so close to the shoreline that on windy days you can feel the spray from waves. (A subtle touch of German biergarten authenticity lies under the picnic tables \u2014 it\u2019s gravel similar to what\u2019s underfoot in biergartens in Bavaria.) Pick:Third Space\u2019sHappy Place, if for no greater reason than the name. This is a citrusy pale ale that\u2019s a real people-pleaser. TheGreat Dane Pub and Breweryat 123 E. Doty St. in downtown Madison has a secluded garden courtyard that\u2019s popular for drinkinganddining, so it lacks the more social biergarten vibe. Even so, the cream brick and ivy-covered walls lend plenty of atmosphere. Pick:Crop Circle Wheat is among the best local hefeweizens, light and crisp and full of fruity, yeasty notes of lemon and banana. The rooftop patio ofThe Lone Girl Brewing Companyat 114 E. Main St. in Waunakee makes this a destination. A covered bar and fire pits are joined by a small stage for occasional live music. Pick:Off the Rail IPA, an American IPA with sharp, resiny bitterness. Vintage Brewing Company\u2019s Sauk Prairie location at 600 Water St. has a balcony-like patio that overlooks the Wisconsin River. Plus, there are about 40 beers on tap. Pick:Sister Golden, a light, easy drinking German k\u00f6lsch. Any self-respecting biergarten needs to serve this traditional style, and it\u2019s a signature brew for Vintage. Hop Haus Brewing Companyat 2975 Sub-Zero Parkway in Fitchburg features both a patio and a rooftop deck with a full bar. About 16 taps are available. Pick:Hammock Naps, a fruited sour that stays refreshing in the sun. Its tartness is balanced with a touch of mango and peach for some fruity sweetness. Honorable mentions:Here are a few more biergartens to put on your bucket (or barrel) list:New Glarus Brewing Company, 218 Hosely Drive, has a large outdoor courtyard perfect for a beer before or after a self-guided tour. Paoli\u2019sHop Gardentaproom, 6889 Canal St., in the century-old mill (listed on the National Registry of Historic Places) is adjacent to a family-friendly park-like setting on the Sugar River, where live music is performed Wednesday-Sunday. Out-of-the-wayHubbleton Brewing Companyis really out in the country at W10445 Hubbleton Road, Waterloo. Its small covered patio overlooks the brewery hopyard and rolling Wisconsin farmland.

As much as it would be nice to be able to hop on a plane any time to experience new sights or tastes from around the world, we don\u2019t always have the money or time to make that happen. And now of course, we can't feasibly do it at all. The good news is that many of the world\u2019s flavors exist right here in Madison. It\u2019s possible to take a culinary tour through Central and South America, hopscotch across Europe to the eastern tip of Africa, and leapfrog over the Himalayas to Southeast Asia, while utilizing only Madison Metro. While many Latin American cuisines may seem similar, there are influences by country and region that set them apart. Salvadoran cuisine is influenced by the country\u2019s indigenous Mayan-Pipil peoples as well as its Spanish colonizers. It employs fresh fruits and vegetables, and the ingredients speak for themselves, in simpler presentations. Marleni Valle is bringing Madisonians a taste of El Salvador atFinca Coffee, the cafe that\u2019s part of the Novation Campus on Madison\u2019s south side. Her quesadillas are not the Mexican variety familiar to Americans; these are more like delicate corn muffins. The pupusas are thick, handmade rounds made from masa harina (ground nixtamalized corn), that are stuffed, sealed and grilled until slightly crisp. Fillings include beans, cheese, and slow-roasted, shredded pork, all wise choices. They\u2019re accompanied by a tart cabbage-jalapeno slaw called curtido and a thin, tomato-based salsa for dipping. Finca is part of a pilot program developed by The Alexander Company, which aims to bring more diversity to the entrepreneurial market; in this case, it\u2019s also brought diversity to our restaurant scene. Finca is currently open for takeout, indoor and patio dining. See updates on itsFacebookpage. La Taguarais no longer Wisconsin\u2019s only Venezuelan restaurant, but it was a pioneer when it opened in a former gyro joint on East Washington Avenue in 2013. In Venezuela, there is again a focus on preparing ingredients simply. The cuisine has been influenced by the foods of the country\u2019s indigenous peoples, European explorers and colonizers (Spanish, Italian, French), with African touches as well. Arepas are a signature item at La Taguara. They differ from pupusas in that they\u2019re made with masarepa, a precooked corn flour (it\u2019s a somewhat lighter corn flavor), and griddled before the filling is added. At La Taguara, the arepa is a pocket bursting with a choice of ingredients: cheese, ham, roast pork, shredded chicken, ground beef, black beans, shredded beef, even shredded eggplant. The roast pork \u2014pernil\u2014 is traditionally marinated in a wine sauce seasoned with rosemary, thyme and oregano. The shredded beef \u2014pabell\u00f3n\u2014 is considered the country\u2019s national dish. The accompanying green sauce is guasacaca, divinely creamy from avocado and perfect for dipping. La Taguara's dining room is once again open, or you can orderonlinefor pickup or delivery. French cafes are small, intimate celebrations of the country\u2019s cuisine. The quaint, homey dining room at Willy Street\u2019sLa Kitchenetteis arranged mostly in tables for two. Here, buckwheat crepes are mostly savory, filled with rich proteins (prosciutto, bacon or smoked salmon), classic cheeses, and often topped with either a fried egg or bechamel sauce. Sweet crepes come with tangy lemon curd or creamy Nutella. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bouch\u00e9 Lavender is an extra French touch atop the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e at La Kitchenette. La Kitchenette may be best known for its lavender cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Yes, it\u2019s a dessert custard, but made elegant with a caramelized, hardened sugar crust. Fragrant vanilla joins a floral hint of lavender in the custard; the dessert is also sprinkled with dried lavender.\u00a0La Kitchenette is open for takeout only as of this posting; orderonline. Faycal Belakhdar\u2019s much-lovedMediterranean Cafeshowcases his Algerian roots as well as Greek, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dishes. The cafe has been serving healthy, delicious, low-cost meals on State Street for over 20 years, always offering vegetarian options. In fancier surroundings, Belakhdar could probably charge twice as much for every dish. But the diners who crowd the place every noon (the cafe is not open for dinner) don\u2019t mind its modest, student-centric vibe. Med Cafe\u2019s great strength is its rotation of daily specials, written on a chalkboard up front and shared on the restaurant\u2019s Facebook page. Thursday seems to be the day for chicken apricot pie, a variation on lasagna or moussaka. Seasoned roasted chicken is layered with rice, dried apricots, and sliced almonds; it\u2019s all topped with a fluffy bechamel. It\u2019s the perfect trifecta of sweet, salty and meaty. Mediterranean Cafe is open for takeout, curbside pickup and delivery. Orderonline. Menu specials are largely Thursday-Saturday. Buraka, on the Madison dining scene in one way or another since the early 1990s, is currently the only spot in town to get Ethiopian fare. Owner Markos Regassa runs a brick-and-mortar restaurant on Williamson Street and a food cart. With its mountainous terrain, Ethiopia has stayed protected from outside influences when it comes to culture and cuisine. However, trade routes between Europe and the Far East brought spices into the region, which Ethiopian cooks rely on for preserving meat (due to limited access to refrigeration). The most popular, can\u2019t-miss dish here is the dorowot, a hearty stew of chicken and carrots in a rich red sauce. It\u2019s enhanced with a blend of spices called berbere \u2014 the heat comes from chilies, augmented by ginger, garlic, coriander, cumin and other spices. Although dorowot can be served on rice, get it with the more traditional injera, a spongy, sour flatbread used to scoop up stews and meat. Eric Tadsen Ethiopian dorowot is popular with the injera at Buraka. Home of the storied \u201cSpice Islands,\u201d Indonesia remains one of the world\u2019s top producers of spices. It\u2019s fitting that many of the country\u2019s traditional dishes are quite aromatic; more influences come from nearby China, Thailand and Vietnam. Buraka is open for indoor and patio dining, takeout and delivery. Bandung, on Williamson Street, serves traditional Indonesian cuisine, plus the occasional shake-up of tradition. The Indo Mac is a fun play on words, but it doesn\u2019t really resemble American mac and cheese. Thick rice noodles, green and yellow onion, bamboo shoots and mushrooms are stir fried and mixed with a creamy red curry sauce that\u2019s both spicy and soothing. Consider choosing the housemade tempeh as your protein. The fermented soybeans are served fried in small bites in this dish. Even if you\u2019re a full-on carnivore, you\u2019ll appreciate the smoky nuttiness of this meatless powerhouse. Bandung is offering takeout and delivery as of this posting. Little Tibetfocuses on serving Himalayan specialties from Bhutan, Nepal and Tibet. The cuisine of Bhutan, a small country on the eastern edge of the Himalayas, is seldom seen in restaurants in the U.S. While it bears some resemblance to Nepalese and Tibetan food, it is spicier, with very hot peppers in most dishes. The Bhutanese ema datshi, a stew of chilies and cheese, is considered the national dish of Bhutan. Little Tibet, located on East Johnson Street, offers several variations of the dish, including shakam datshi, made with a homemade beef jerky. This is much thicker, yet less chewy, than American jerky. The beef is simmered in a white sauce thickened with creamy gouda and sharp blue cheese, with plenty of heat from Thai chilies and jalape\u00f1os. There\u2019s a nice addition of daikon radish, too. Unless you\u2019re Bhutanese, or one of the lucky few who are able to travel to Bhutan, this could be one of the few places you can try datshi. Little Tibet is open for takeout and delivery as of this posting. [Editor's note: This story was originally written to publish in the Isthmus Dining special section in April.

{"url": "https://isthmus.com/opinion/citizen-dave/madison-schools-sticker-shock/", "title": "Madison schools sticker shock", "text": "Much of the tax increase this year is due to the $607 million referendum passed in November 2024 byDave Cieslewicz Citizen Dave December 22, 2025 8:00 AM Freepik I follow this pretty closely, so I knew it was coming. But I wonder how many Madison homeowners had a rude awakening last week when they opened their property tax bills. Taxes on the average house here went up by around $800 or 11%. And almost all of that increase is due to the $607 million in new taxes voters approved with an almost 70% \u201cyes\u201d vote on two referendums in November 2024. The school board rushed those referendums to the presidential ballot because they knew there would be a massive turnout of liberal voters, most of whom did not follow local issues. Liberals showed up en masse to vote for Kamala Harris and against Donald Trump and while there, they noticed there was an opportunity to also show their support for public schools. It was a no-brainer \u2014 in so many unfortunate ways. There was a lot wrong with those referendums, but the flagship of bad policy was the new Shabazz/Sherman building. That's the school building on the north side which houses Sherman Middle School and Malcolm Shabazz High School. Enrollment in both schools has been declining and is projected to continue to go down for the foreseeable future. In fact, Shabazz has only about 114 students, which should raise questions about why the school exists at all. The logical thing to do would have been to close the schools and redraw the attendance maps. Instead, the school board proposed a new, bigger building. In fact, at $108 million it was the single biggest item in the $507 million capital referendum. And now, after the fact, MMSD is doing an attendance boundary study. This is madness. But with no organized opposition to the hard-left in Madison, this issue and others like it were hardly raised in the mainstream media. I did write an op-ed in theState Journaland I tried to raise the alarm in this space, but that was pretty much all there was in terms of a dissenting voice. And now it's time to pay up. And here's a rich irony. Madison officials talk endlessly about affordability while supporting referendums that increase property taxes at three times the rate of inflation, something that will also soon be reflected in rents. The one certain thing local government can really do to keep housing costs down is to restrain property taxes. And we're going vigorously in the other direction. Finally, there's a question of what we get for our money. Again because there is no loyal opposition, there was no demand for accountability in the spending. The school board promised taxpayers absolutely nothing in terms of improved test scores, less violence and better behavior in the classroom, or a narrowing of the racial achievement gap. They did spend $100,000 on a new MMSD logo, so we got that. Will this sticker shock finally result in some sort of accountability movement? I wouldn't bet on it. In a government town a lot of voters aren't going to vote against more money for government. And among liberals, public schools are the closest thing to a sacrament. Liberals would sooner forgo kale and MS NOW before they'd vote against a school referendum, no matter how many facts you throw at them. I literally had people tell me that they saw my arguments, agreed with them, but \u201cI just could never vote against a school referendum.\u201d It\u2019s like religion. So, my guess is we're just going to slog along like this. We'll talk and talk and talk about how much we care about public education while blithely accepting terrible performance in our schools. We'll blather on endlessly about the cost of housing while voting for 11% property tax increases. Madison's famous separation from reality grows wider. Dave Cieslewicz is a Madison- and Upper Peninsula-based writer who served as mayor of Madison from 2003 to 2011. You can read more of his work atYellow Stripes & Dead Armadillos. byDave Cieslewicz December 22, 2025 8:00 AM Dave, do you think the defunding that's been happening at the state level due to the extreme conservatives have been doing to public education since 2010 has anything to do with the need to go to referendum or any dismal stats coming from the public schools?  What about that surplus they are hanging on to?  We are effectively paying twice, when our original taxes should have gone to the schools in the first place.  Also, we are anticipating and indeed building for an influx of people into this City so abandoning one school building won't make sense in the long run.  It just drives me crazy to hear people complain about taxes when our money is all being given up to corporations or to compensate for bad policies.  It turns out you don't know everything about public schools. Debbie55 days ago New buildings can't fix inherent dysfunction in the system.

It's an important theme and something that we should be continually examining in our culture. Why does this keep happening?\u201d Just two years afterEverlasting Faint, a new opera based on a centuries-old Appalachian murder, was firstpresented in a sung \u201creading\u201dby University Opera, it\u2019s premiering as a full-fledged production. That\u2019s a rapid progression, as these things go. With music by Madison\u2019s Scott Gendel and libretto by Sandra Flores-Strand,Everlasting Faintis based on the true story of a 19th century murder in Greenbrier County, West Virginia. When Elva Zona Heaster Shue was found dead in 1897, the cause of death was recorded as childbirth. Later, Shue\u2019s ghost appeared to her mother, Mary Jane Heaster, declaring she\u2019d been murdered by her husband. (An \u201ceverlasting faint\u201d is a 19th-century term for a sudden, unexplained death.) Ultimately her body was exhumed and an autopsy performed, which revealed her neck had been broken and her windpipe crushed. Her husband was eventually convicted of her murder. \u201cI like the absolute American sound of it,\u201d says Stickann, a New York-based opera director and choreographer who has worked with Madison Opera before. \u201cThis is true American mythology.\u201d It\u2019s not just the story that feels American, Stickann says. \u201cThe musical ideas that Scott put into it have such an Americana feel to them. Those of us working in new opera often talk about finding the American voice in opera, because it\u2019s notoriously French and Italian and German. This feels like an opera that truly has an American voice.\u201d Being the first to stage an opera is \u201cexhilarating,\u201d says Stickann. \u201cYou get to make of it whatever you want, without anybody saying \u2018It's usually done this way.\u2019 It's the same thing for the singers who are creating the role. That's an incredible opportunity to allow your voice to be the one that is thought of when people think about how the show should be put together.\u201d Librettist Sandra Flores-Strand, who\u2019s written several operas focused on the lives of women and immigrants, discovered the story of the Greenbrier Ghost while researching another opera. She saw it referred to as the \u201cfirst court case in history to be won based on the testimony of a ghost,\u201d and delved into the legend, quickly sketching out the idea for the whole opera. \u201cI got a lot of positive feedback [after the University Opera reading] and I felt like the story resonated because it parallels so closely to what we see in the news,\u201d says Flores-Strand. Other feedback led Gendel and Flores-Strand to clarify some plot points and simplify the music for the prologues, sung by a young boy, before each act. The two say this is a good opera for a first-timer or a regular opera-goer. \u201cA lot of what Sandra and I were aiming for in this piece was to tackle serious issues, but also make it very entertaining and exciting,\u201d says Gendel. \u201cWe have easy ways for people to get into it \u2014 for instance ghosts and a drinking song.\u201d But at the same time, darker subjects run through the whole work. In \u201cThat Devil Killed Her,\u201d Mary Jane Heaster \u2014 really the heart of the opera \u2014 sings about her daughter\u2019s death over dissonant, disturbing music: \u201cThat devil killed her and knew he\u2019d get away with it\u2026. When men fall, they raise statues. For women, they lay flowers. Which do we remember most? Immortal figures\u2026or wilted ones?\u201d Gendel reminds those who may be hesitant about opera that this one is sung in English and that it \u201cmoves at the pace that 21st century media moves. It\u2019s so direct and emotionally engaged there's no need to be afraid. Except of the ghosts. You have to be afraid of the ghosts.\u201d Madison Opera presents the world premiere ofEverlasting FaintFeb. 13 and 15 in the Overture Center-Capitol Theater. byLinda Falkenstein February 4, 2026 1:30 PM", "date": "2026-02-04", "author": "byLinda Falkenstein", "section": "opinion", "location": "general madison", "source": "isthmus"}

The announcement last week that Madison and Los Angeles would be the only two U.S. cities hosting listening parties for British superstar Harry Styles\u2019 new albumKiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally., dropping March 6, lacked some important details. Styles\u2019 team kept the location of the event secret until hours before it started. His record label did not respond to a request for comment. Only 100 people got invited to the event and we were not among the lucky ones. Desperate, we started messaging people on TikTok and Reddit to see what we could learn. Just one contact worked out: Caroline Accetta, who grew up in Milwaukee, posted a TikTok on Monday announcing she had won tickets to the listening party. She agreed to a phone interview, describing herself as \u201cHarry\u2019s biggest fan.\u201d Accetta says she has been to 14 of Styles\u2019 concerts and \u201cthought she was being pranked\u201d when she received the email invitation. \u201cHe has been with me through so many parts of life,\u201d says Accetta. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful that we can keep doing this together.\u201d Less than 24 hours before the party, Accetta still hadn\u2019t been notified of the location. \u201cThere has got to be enough room to dance becauseDisco, Occasionallyis in the name of the album,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe the Majestic?\u201d Styles first broke into the international scene as part of boy band One Direction. When the band went on indefinite hiatus in 2016, he released his self-titled first solo album in 2017 and followed up with subsequent releases in 2019 and 2022. Beyond his music, a mix of warm pop and soaring ballads, Styles\u2019 international superstar status has also been bolstered by his flamboyant, gender-ambiguous fashion sense. Accetta tentatively agreed to share the location when she received it, but text messages to her in the few hours prior to the event went unanswered. With no other options, we started visiting all the Madison venues we considered likely spots. Nothing was happening at the Sylvee, High Noon Saloon, Majestic or Strictly Discs music store on Monroe Street. But at the last moment, we received an anonymous tip: Lola\u2019s Hi/Lo Lounge on North Sherman Avenueposted on InstagramWednesday afternoon that it would host a \u201cprivate event\u201d and be closed to the general public in the evening. We scrambled to get there, making it by 6:10 p.m., still 20 minutes before the event's 6:30 p.m. check-in time. The view through the windows was completely obscured by black curtains, though the phrase \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d part of the album\u2019s marketing, was pasted on the glass. Two young men, both wearing shirts displaying those words, were operating video cameras by the door. An older employee, ostensibly event staff, eyed us suspiciously as we walked up. We identified ourselves as reporters and asked if this was the Harry Styles event. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, somewhat uncomfortably. He said he would go inside and \u201cfind someone\u201d for us to chat with. After about two minutes, he came back and said that \u201cit\u2019s a private event and there\u2019s a list.\u201d Implication: Go away. We decided to wait it out at the nearby Drackenberg\u2019s Cigar Bar, where the bartender gave us a warm welcome. Around 10 minutes later, we noticed through the windows two women walking by in flashy dresses \u2014 a little too dolled-up for Wednesday evening at the strip mall. We dashed out the door and were met with a line of nearly 100 people. Translation: Harry (\u2018s album) is here. Those in line were ecstatic to have made the cut for the listening party. Longtime friends Maria Sadowske \u2014 the woman wearing the sequin dress \u2014 and Lauren Murray have each other saved as \u201cHarry Styles\u201d in their phones (sometimes they pretend that, when they\u2019re texting each other, they\u2019re actually texting the star). Both Milwaukee residents, they say they\u2019ve been listening to Styles since One Direction\u2019s \u201cX Factor\u201d days in 2010. \u201cWe were literally driving to the [Milwaukee County] zoo to meet at the zoo with our kids. We got out of the car and just had, like, a two-minute dance party because we were freaking out,\u201d says Sadowske. Sisters Patricia Rivera Torres, 25, and Amanda Rivera Torres, 23, say they were bewildered to receive tickets, and to see that Madison, where they\u2019ve grown up, was one of two cities in the nation selected for a listening party. They\u2019ve both been listening to Styles since around 2012, when they first saw him at Miller Park as part of One Direction. \u201cNever in a million years would I even think he would have come to Madison,\u201d says Patricia. \u201cIt's just really cool to be able to experience this in our own hometown.\u201d Lizzy Larson Sisters Patricia Rivera-Torres, right, and Amanda Rivera-Torres grew up in Madison. Says Patricia: 'It's just really cool to be able to experience this in our own hometown.' Noah Showalter, one of the few men in line, was still waiting at 6:40 for a friend to arrive. He\u2019d been spending the day wondering where he\u2019d end up that night. \u201cThere was lots of theorizing between my friends and I about where it was going to be,\u201d says Showalter, who was wearing a jazzy black and white button-up shirt. \u201cWe thought, Majestic? No, too basic. A random warehouse in the middle of the cornfields?

City officials are looking to promote tourism through a new marketing effort meant to pitch Madison as a \u201cmusic city.\u201d Aresolutionunanimously passed by the city council Sept. 16 authorizes the city\u2019s planning division to enter into a contract with local marketing firm The Creative Company Inc. \u201cto develop a regional music brand for the Greater Madison area.\u201d The $14,060 contract is being funded through a $25,000 earmark in the city\u2019s room tax commission budget for music tourism efforts. The Creative Company would be expected to produce a narrative statement, logos, and other marketing materials, says Angela Puerta, a city planner and local musician. Three firms were reviewed prior to The Creative Company being selected, Puerta says. Puerta says organizations like Destination Madison or Frank Productions could potentially use such marketing materials to promote events or artists and strengthen the city\u2019s musical tourism profile \u2014 performance metrics might include increased page clicks or tourist visits. Similar efforts have been undertaken inNashvilleandAlbuquerque, she says. Making Madison\u2019s music scene more equitable is a key goal of the project. Puerta says the process of developing the brand \u201cwill have a lot of emphasis on inclusion.\u201d \u201cWe want to make sure that this is not to support the status quo,\u201d says Puerta. \u201cWe want to make sure that everybody's included, every genre is included, as I said, hip-hop music or Latin music, not always the same styles that we typically hear in Wisconsin.\u201d The brand project is meantto represent diversity in Madison\u2019s music scene, say Karen Reece and Rob Dz, co-presidents of the Urban Community Arts Network. Reece says \u201cwe want to see people start using that brand identity.\u201d \u201cThat might be putting it on a flyer or on a website and making sure that all different kinds of people feel like it's theirs, and feel some ownership in this music scene,\u201d says Reece. Madison has had a troubled relationship with hip-hop acts, in particular. Throughout the last two decades, multiple venues in the city stopped booking hip-hop acts, often citing acts of violence that occurred nearby. A 2018studyconducted by UCAN and researchers at UW-Madison however, found that incidences of violence were no more common at hip-hop performances than for other genres of music. Researchers sifted through more than 4,000 police calls from live music venues from 2008 to 2016 for the study. \u201cWe went through a stretch of time where police would preemptively cancel events,\u201d says Reece. \u201cIf they saw certain people's faces on a Facebook post related to an event, they would go directly to the [organization], to the building owner, and tell them they should cancel the event.\u201d The Greater Madison Music City initiative was formed in early 2020, with city support, to improve equity in Madison\u2019s music scene and study music\u2019s economic impact on Madison and Dane County. Among recommendations the group made in a 2022reportwere that the city should create a music tourism strategy that would build \u201cGreater Madison\u2019s brand as a music city, increase knowledge of the city\u2019s musical heritage, and promote local music.\u201d Reece and Dz view the music brand project as fulfilling that recommendation. Tourism plays a key role in determining who feels at home in a city, Dz says. \u201cIf you get a kid that goes to a [historically Black college or university] and comes here for a job interview \u2014 if he doesn't see culture that looks like them, then what's the likelihood that they're going to want to come to this place?\u201d says Dz. The Creative Company will plan a workshop to bring members of the local music scene \u2014 including artists, venue owners, business owners and more \u2014 into the brand\u2019s development process. Both Reece and Dz hope the brand will serve as a first step toward other conversations on how to make Madison\u2019s music scene more equitable. \u201cIt's an important step,\u201d says Dz. \u201cHopefully leading with this kind of opens up the conversation to be having other areas.\u201d byLiam Beran October 3, 2025 9:00 AM", "date": "2025-10-03", "author": "byLiam Beran", "section": "music", "location": "general madison", "source": "isthmus"}

As we head into cooler days, Madison\u2019s downtown classical music groups will keep the stage warm with world premieres, a celebration of Earth, dueling violins, and a true crime ghost story as they prepare their 2025-2026 seasons. MADISON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The upcoming season for theMadison Symphony Orchestrais bittersweet. It celebrates its 100th anniversary, but it\u2019s also the final season forJohn DeMain, the MSO\u2019s music director since 1994. DeMain says he will continue his conducting career and, if asked, will conduct a concert here and there as a guest conductor or conductor emeritus. The MSO\u2019s centennial celebrations begin in Overture Hall on Sept. 19 with an all-Tchaikovsky program starring pianist Olga Kern. They continue on Sept. 20 with Cirque de la Symphonie, a mix of circus arts and film music. The opening concert of the MSO\u2019s 2025-2026 subscription season happens on Oct. 17-19 in Overture Hall. The concert stars UW-Madison piano professor Christopher Taylor, soprano Jeni Houser, mezzo-soprano Emily Fons, and the Madison Symphony Chorus. On the program is Mahler\u2019s Symphony No. 2 and Mason Bates\u2019sResurrexit, which DeMain describes as \u201cabstract, but beautiful.\u201d C\u00e9sar Franck\u2019s Symphonic Variations features Taylor\u2019s piano artistry. Several guest artists return. Alban Gerhardt plays Haydn\u2019s Cello Concerto in D Major on November 21-23. Yefim Bronfman plays Brahms\u2019 Piano Concerto No. 2 on Jan. 23-25, 2026, and Rachel Barton Pine returns on Feb. 20-22 with Korngold\u2019s Violin Concerto in D Major. On March 20-22, Emanuel Ax plays Mozart\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 25, a charming piece that shows off Ax\u2019s clean, delicate touch. Spanish rhythms take center stage on April 10-12 with the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet. The season features many 21st-century compositions, including a newly commissioned work by Jake Heggie.EARTH: A Choral Symphony, gets its world premiere in the final concert of the season on May 1-3. In a 2012 interview withIsthmusHeggie said that DeMain understands his work innately because they both have backgrounds in American musical theater. DeMain, he added, is \u201cone of the top conductors in the world.\u201d EARTHfeatures the Madison Symphony Chorus, Mt. Zion Gospel Choir, and the Madison Youth Choirs. \u201cWe wanted to write something for our arts partners in Madison who we have worked with,\u201d says DeMain. It also stars Met Opera soprano Ailyn P\u00e9rez. DeMain says Gene Scheer\u2019s libretto \u201crecounts the evolutionary process of our extraordinary planet.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t want Jake to write a piece that was centennial and Madison-specific because then it would be played one time and never played again,\u201d says DeMain. \u201cI wanted Jake to write a piece that had legs and that other orchestras may want to perform in the future.\u201d DeMain will conduct his final concert as the MSO\u2019s music director during a weekend of free centennial events at the Overture Center on June 13-14. \u201cThere will be rock groups, world music groups, and jazz as well as chamber music,\u201d he says. Peter Rodgers Greg Zelek creates opportunities for the organ. MSO\u2019S OVERTURE CONCERT ORGAN Greg Zelek, the MSO\u2019s principal organist, has built a sizable and avid audience for the Overture concert organ. \u201cI want to introduce different audiences to the organ, new people who would otherwise not come,\u201d he says. Thisseasonhighlights the organ\u2019s versatility: ideal for classical and sacred music, but also for jazz and folk songs. The organ series has four concerts that run Oct. 2 to March 31, 2026. All performances are in Overture Hall. The first concert features Zelek and the UW-Madison Concert Choir under the direction of Mariana Farah. The repertoire ranges from sacred music to Brazilian folk songs. Instrumentalists from the School of Music will also make an appearance in Eriks Esenvalds\u2019Trinity Te Deum. On Nov. 18, Zelek and trumpeter Caleb Hudson, Zelek\u2019s former colleague at the Juilliard School, play a mix of Bach and jazz. Also included are Bartok\u2019sRomanian Folk Dances, exotic little tunes that look deceptively easy to play. Organist Felix Hell returns on Feb. 24, 2026, with his own arrangement of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony. Zelek says the audience will hear the Fifth in a new and exciting way. The final concert on March 31 features Zelek and nine of his MSO colleagues in celebration of the centennial. Works of Handel, Mozart, Bach and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor bring another organ season to a rousing finale. WISCONSIN CHAMBER ORCHESTRA TheWisconsin Chamber Orchestracontinues its exploration into the innovative works of composers of color in a concert titledEndeavoron Oct. 10 in the Overture Center\u2019s Capitol Theater. This is the third installment of itsMusical Landscapes in Colorproject. \u201cWe have a multi-generational approach to this year\u2019s lineup,\u201d says music director Andrew Sewell. \u201cAutumn Maria Reed and Xavier Foley represent the younger composers, while older composers include Regina Harris Baiocchi, Eric Gould, and Omar Thomas, who are in mid-career.\u201d This concert will be recorded live for a 2026 album release. The WCO\u2019s Masterworks series consists of five concerts, all in the Capitol Theater. Masterworks I on Nov. 14 features Finnish composer Rautavaara\u2019sSuite for Stringsfrom 1952. The Suite\u2019s layered textures are reminiscent of Bach, but its wispy veils of sound place it in modern times. Then Vladyslava Luchenko plays Mendelssohn\u2019s Violin Concerto in E Minor. Masterworks II on Jan. 30, 2026, features Ilya Yakushev in Prokofiev\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 3. Yakushev\u2019s style is fresh and energetic, just right for the concerto\u2019s fast pace and unpredictable twists and turns. Masterwork III on Feb. 27 features the world premiere of Dan Cavanagh\u2019s Concerto for Jazz Trio. Cavanagh is the director of the Mead Witter School of Music at the UW-Madison. Concluding this concert, the WCO presentsRegeneration: A Pentalogy, a symphony by local composer Michael Bell. Kanopy Dance joins the WCO in the company\u2019s world premiere ofRenascence, choreographed to Bell\u2019s music. This will be the first timeRenascenceis performed in its entirety with an orchestra. Masterworks IV and V are vastly different. For IV, violinists Eric Silberger and Gilles Apap return on March 27 as dueling violinists. Masterworks V on April 17 features pianist Salome Jordania. Sewell says Jordania is a Georgian pianist based in both the U.S. and London making her Madison debut playing Saint Saens\u2019 Piano Concerto No. 2. MADISON OPERA Courtesy Madison Opera Madison Opera tackles \u2018La Boh\u00e8me\u2019 with Terrence Chin-Loy, left, and Ren\u00e9e Richardson. La Boh\u00e8meopens theMadison Opera\u2019s seasonon Nov. 7 and 9 in Overture Hall. \u201cAt its core,La Boh\u00e8meis about a group of young people dealing with the realities of friendship, love, financial hardship, illness, and ultimately death,\u201d says Kathryn Smith, general director of the Madison Opera. \u201cIn real life, everyone deals with at least some of these issues, and Puccini set it all beautifully to music.\u201d After its world premiere in Turin in 1896,La Boh\u00e8mepremiered in the United Kingdom in 1897, the same year that a murder happened across the Atlantic in Greenbrier County, West Virginia. Trout Shue killed his wife. But the doctor classified her death as an \u201ceverlasting faint,\u201d a 19th century phrase used when a woman\u2019s cause of death is unknown. Her ghost returns to tell her mother that Trout killed her. This true crime story is the subject of the next opera,Everlasting Faint, on Feb. 13 and 15 in the Overture Center\u2019s Capitol Theater. Madison-based composer Scott Gendel and librettist Sandra Flores-Strand weave together an intriguing contemporary opera about a mother\u2019s efforts to find justice for her daughter. After Puccini\u2019s gritty realism and Gendel\u2019s ghost story, the season ends in Overture Hall on April 24 and 26 with Mozart\u2019s well loved romantic comedy,Cos\u1ec9 fan tutte. Welcome to the salon Alex Fedorov Angie Zhang. The seasons for the MSO, WCO and the Madison Opera take place in large venues that seat hundreds, even thousands.

I have to confess that I haven\u2019t seen Madison Ballet since Ja\u2019 Malik became the company\u2019s artistic executive director and I\u2019m glad to report that under his capable and creative guidance, the company\u2019s deep bench of talented dancers is doing excellent work. It\u2019s clear that across the board the dancers are well trained and well rehearsed. The program opens with the Madison premiere ofSchubert Waltzesfrom choreographer Heinz Poll. While it is the most traditional ballet on the program, Poll still surprises with innovative lifts and fun touches like bourr\u00e9es in parallel for the women. Three couples charm us throughout, playing with musical phrasing and all six genuinely connecting with each other on stage. I was pleased to see that the always outstanding Shannon Quirk is still with the company. She is paired with Benjamin Shepard, an attentive and considerate partner (especially when he tackles lifts right after a demanding solo). Tom Mattingly\u2019sFlightwas another Madison premiere, set to music by Oliver Davis and featuring truly lovely costumes in muted tones by designer Sarah Dornink. Charlotte Junge, a former apprentice and now a company dancer, is a breakout star. You\u2019re drawn to her because she combines top-notch technique with a confident, commanding stage presence. Her pas de deux with the gifted Ben Rose in the second movement was a particular delight. Mattingly has a knack for creating striking formations and keeping things fresh with quicksilver directional changes.Flightis a deeply pleasant experience. Ja\u2019 Malik\u2019sVariations on a Grosso, set to Antonio Correlli\u2019s lively score, has been expanded and re-worked. Julie Ballard\u2019s innovative lighting design initially elicited a gasp from the audience and was compelling for the duration. The sextet of dancers was uniformly excellent. Michaela King shines, her supple and expressive back showcased in her glittering purple costume. Eric Stith, a strong turner and jumper, was the consummate professional, not letting a glitch with the recorded music interrupt his solo. Junge and Dana Sheldon were well matched and seemed to genuinely connect through the choreography.\u00a0The work is punctuated by swiveling hips, rolling shoulders, and surprising floorwork which kept me guessing, but ultimately the simple final moments resonated the most with me. The dancers bow to one another from opposite sides of the stage in reverence and, as they exit, turn their heads to catch a last fleeting glimpse of each other. Agape\u2019, from Ja\u2019 Malik, is a pas de deux for two male dancers that soulfully conveys yearning. It opens (and closes) with a lift so striking I wasn\u2019t even sure what I was seeing, the dancers\u2019 bodies entangled in an innovative shape. James Wainwright and Antony Zambrano Reyes danced with both vulnerability and strength. It felt as though their souls were laid bare, their chests exposed above flowing chiffon skirts from Fernanda Yamaguchi (also a company dancer). The charming crowd-pleaserWeibermachtclosed the program. Choreographer Richard Walters (company rehearsal director and school principal) uses Mozart\u2019s music in wise and witty ways. The all-female cast is initially clad in blue and white dresses, but Sarah Martin, a talented comedic actress, is the first to don a long black vest and clunky black boots, and soon the entire cast follows her fashion lead. Clomping boots juxtaposed with elegance and grace had the crowd on its feet during a particularly spirited curtain call. Walters\u2019 work is amusing without being cutesy and genuinely made me smile when Martin cavorted with Sheldon to Papagano and Papagena\u2019s duet fromThe Magic Flute. Promenade Hall is an intimate performance space: You can see the dancers\u2019 perspiration and hear their breathing, creating a personal connection between the audience and performers. Ballet can intimidate people. Audiences often include die-hard balletomanes (often including ballet students and their dedicated parents) alongside people who may have only seenThe Nutcrackerand feel that they don\u2019t know enough about the art form to fully appreciate it. \"Pointes of View\" offers something for everyone. Regular balletgoers will find wonderful technique in challenging works, while newcomers can simply be swept up in the music, costumes, choreographic creativity, and the dancers\u2019 ability to convey sincere emotion.\u00a0Luckily, you have three more opportunities to see this excellent production; matinees at 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and a Saturday evening performance at 7 p.m. [Editor's note: This post has been updated to correct the spelling of the names of Michaela King and Fernanda Yamaguchi.] byKatie Reiser February 14, 2026 10:50 AM", "date": "2026-02-14", "author": "byKatie Reiser", "section": "arts", "location": "general madison", "source": "isthmus"}

It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen a novel from Madison writer Susanna Daniel. Daniel, who runs the Madison Writers\u2019 Studio with novelist Michelle Wildgen, published her last novel,Sea Creatures,in 2013. It wasn\u2019t a fallow period. BetweenSea Creaturesand her new novel,Girlfriending, which publishes on Feb. 10, Daniels wrote another novel that she was on the verge of selling in March 2020. Things stalled because of the pandemic, but ultimately, Daniel says, it was the murder of George Floyd that made her decide not to publish it. \u201cThe world changed so much,\u201d she says.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter if it was a good book or not. It wasn\u2019t me anymore and it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to put out in the world anymore.\u201d The newGirlfriendingis autofiction, a genre that \u2014 like all fiction \u2014 blends truth with invention, but leans more heavily into real events. The narrator ofGirlfriendingis, like Daniel, an editor and writer who teaches writing classes. Like Daniel, her last name is Daniel (the narrator has no first name). Girlfriending\u2019s narrator, newly divorced from her husband, begins dating women and experiences two breakups in fairly short order. She vows to find 10 more women to date, as part of what the character terms her \u201clesbian adolescence.\u201d \u201cI was writing while I was heartbroken \u2014 all of it was very much happening in real time,\u201d Daniel says. She would come home from a date and start taking notes. \u201cI was almost trying to watch myself from a distance so that I could find some kind of story to tell myself about this massive hole I had fallen into.\u201d Daniel wanted to consider what the writer is giving the reader. \u201cWhat are you offering? A memoir or a story from life is, above everything, an offering to the reader. And I felt I had something to offer.\u201d What emerges is not just a quest for love and reconciliation, but for community. Daniel teamed with woman-centered publisher Third Rail Press, dedicated to women\u2019s stories that mainstream publishers deem too difficult or unmarketable \u2014 here, realistic depictions of sex and what Daniel calls \u201cunconventional family arrangements that are not unhappy.\u201d She was relieved the editors were on board: \"I'm happy, really happy.\" Daniel will discussGirlfriendingwith Minneapolis-based novelist (and Daniel\u2019s longtime friend) author Curtis Sittenfeld at 7 p.m. on Feb. 12 at the Central Library as part of the Wisconsin Book Festival. byLinda Falkenstein February 8, 2026 1:00 PM", "date": "2026-02-08", "author": "byLinda Falkenstein", "section": "arts", "location": "general madison", "source": "isthmus"}

{"url": "https://isthmus.com/news/news/madison-hemp-stores-face-evolving-federal-state-and-local-regs/", "title": "Madison hemp stores face evolving regulations", "text": "Many of the hemp-derived THC products they sell could be banned by late 2026 byNoe Goldhaber News February 17, 2026 9:00 AM Tommy Washbush Businesses selling hemp-derived products line State Street, making up a visible part of Madison\u2019s retail economy. But many owners are now staring down major federal changes that could make the products they sell illegal by November 2026 unless Congress acts. \u201cWe're not planning on much of a future, unfortunately,\u201d Matt Nelson, co-founder of Herbal Aspect, tellsIsthmus. \u201cWe've been building this business for five years. You know, it's a seven-figure business...and now for no good reason, it's all being undone.\u201d Nelson \u2014 who owns five businesses across the Madison region \u2014 says the worst part is the potential laying off of his 22 employees. \u201cIn an ideal situation, we can keep a store open with whatever regulated products we can sell, keep some core members of our team,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cThey love the company, so they all kind of want to stick it out to the end. You know, we'll give them as much heads up as we can.\u201d Aloopholein the 2018 Farm Bill effectively legalized hemp-derived THC products by defining hemp based on delta-9 THC concentration, allowing other intoxicating cannabinoids to proliferate like delta-8. In 2025, Congress passed legislation thatnarrowed the legal definitionof hemp, effectively banning most hemp-derived THC products on shelves by late 2026. While many states responded to the 2018 legislation by developing regulatory frameworks or legalizing marijuana outright, Wisconsin remains one of justsix states withouthemp regulations beyond those in the 2018 Farm Bill. Local officials, however, have moved ahead. Citing concerns over youth access and accidental ingestion, the Madison city councilapprovedage restrictions, signage requirements and penalties for noncompliant hemp businesses in November. City council President Regina Vidaver, who sponsored the legislation, says the city\u2019s approach is focused on harm reduction and consumer protection. \u201cThere\u2019s zero regulation right now, and so [we\u2019re] trying to put that regulatory framework on them so that people can know what they're consuming in exactly the same way they know what they're consuming when they're consuming alcohol,\u201d says Vidaver. Tony Herman, owner of Dank of America, a Madison business with two locations, says the industry generally welcomes reasonable regulations. \u201cRegulation has been a big topic in the industry for quite some time,\u201d Herman says. \u201cIt\u2019s severely unregulated, so to have some regulation is extremely welcome \u2014 with the hope that it doesn\u2019t become overregulated and turn into a problem.\u201d The city policy mirrors abipartisan state proposalco-authored by Sen. Patrick Testin, R-Stevens Point, and Rep. Tony Kurtz, R-Wonewoc, which would establish a 21-and-over age restriction, truth-in-labeling requirements, independent testing standards and potency limits for hemp-derived beverages. Testin says the legislation was developed with input from the hemp industry to create \u201ccommon-sense regulations.\u201d Testin describes Wisconsin\u2019s hemp industry as the \u201cWild Wild West.\u201d \u201cThere are no age requirements, no restrictions whatsoever,\u201d Testin says. \u201cThat has certainly caused a lot of angst and heartburn, not just within the industry, but for a lot of consumers out there.\u201d Public health data underscores those concerns. Between September 2023 and August 2025,Dane County recorded 167THC-related EMS calls involving people under 21, including four calls in recent months for children under 10, according to statistics released by Public Health Madison and Dane County in September. Unlike marijuana, hemp-derived THC products can be sold at gas stations and grocery stores, including locations near schools. Without clear labeling, officials say accidental ingestion is an increasing concern. \u201cA lot of the products are marketed in a way that looks like candy or the drinks just appear to be seltzers,\u201d Vidaver says. \u201cIt can be difficult for even a parent to know if their kid is ingesting something intoxicating.\u201d While some local businesses, including Herbal Aspect and Dank of America, voluntarily check IDs and test their products in the absence of statewide regulation, both officials and business owners say inconsistent enforcement remains a problem. \u201cWe've tried to operate in the way we want the laws to be written so everybody is carded,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cWe actually have pretty strict protocols for even moving product in between stores.\u201d In 2024, Public Health Madison and Dane County surveyed 68 retailers selling hemp-derived products. While 71% of stores reported having a 21-and-over policy, department staff were asked for ID in just four of 13 stores where they purchased a product or received a free sample, according to thesurvey. Dank of America\u2019s Herman also emphasizes the importance of independent testing. While his company ensures its products meet medical marijuana quality standards, he says that without formal regulations, there is little to prevent contamination from heavy metals or mold. \u201cYou have to test for mold, E. coli and heavy metals,\u201d Herman says. \u201cThat should be a minimum standard when you\u2019re selling a product to another human being.\u201d Vidaver says the city\u2019s legislation will also license hemp businesses similarly to alcohol retailers, with public health officials working to transition the Alcohol License Review Committee into an Intoxicating Substances Review Committee. \u201cIf you look at State Street, the density of THC shops is very high,\u201d Vidaver says. \u201cWhen visitors come to the city and walk down our main downtown shopping street, and every other shop is a THC shop, it\u2019s not a good look.\u201d Nelson says that while most of the city council\u2019s regulations align with practices Herbal Aspect already follows, one provision poses a significant problem: prohibiting new businesses from selling hemp-derived products within a quarter-mile of schools or parks. \u201cEffectively, that rule means no one can open a new hemp store,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cThere\u2019s almost nowhere in this town that\u2019s more than a quarter-mile from a park or a school.\u201d Testin and Kurtz\u2019s bill is one of several bills state legislators are weighingto address hemp and marijuana in Wisconsin. Another bipartisan bill introduced by Sen. Eric Wimberger, R-Oconto, creates a three-tier system for hemp modeled after the alcohol industry, separating manufacturers, distributors and retailers and grandfathering in current alcohol-license holders. Intestimonyto the Assembly Committee on State Affairs in November, hemp industry advocates accused Wisconsin\u2019s powerful alcohol lobby, the Tavern League, of pushing for the legislation. Herman also criticized the bill. Tommy Washbush Nelson at Herbal Aspect on Winnebago Street: 'We're not planning on much of a future, unfortunately.' \u201cI think beverage companies are losing millions to the cannabis industry,\u201d Herman says. \u201cThis [regulation push] is happening fast because some very powerful people are losing a lot of money.\u201d Another Republican-ledbillwould effectively ban hemp in Wisconsin. Testin says his and Kurtz\u2019s bill fits the \u201cGoldilocks\u201d approach. \u201cWe've got three bowls of porridge. One is a little bit too cold \u2014 that's the bill that would outright ban these products. You got one that's a little too hot, where you have them thrown all into the three-tier system, like alcohol. And then I think ours finds the right balance and the right approach,\u201d Testin says. Testin says it was \u201ctruly clear as mud\u201d whether the passing of his bill could protect Wisconsin\u2019s hemp industry in the face of the federal loophole closure. \u201cI'm hopeful and optimistic that Congress will undo what they did, but in the event that they don't, we still need to make sure that we have some regulatory framework at the state level because whether individuals like these products or not the horse is out of the barn and you can't put the genie back in the bottle and these are widely popular for individuals that utilize them,\u201d Testin says. Testin also says the looming federal changes could create a larger vacuum for black market products in Wisconsin. For business owners like Nelson and Herman, the uncertainty has upended long-term planning. Herman said Dank of America also operates as an event space, lounge and gallery, giving the business alternative revenue streams if hemp products are no longer legal. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a cannabis dispensary,\u201d Herman says. \u201cWe\u2019re a cultural gathering spot \u2014 a lounge, an event space, an art gallery. It\u2019s not all about cannabis sales.\u201d Testin is optimistic that lawmakers could advance the bill before the session ends Feb. 19, saying they are considering amendments to build a broader consensus: \u201cMy hope is that we get something done in the next couple of weeks before the session wraps up and everyone heads back to their districts for another wild ride in Wisconsin politics.\u201d byNoe Goldhaber February 17, 2026 9:00 AM", "date": "2026-02-17", "author": "byNoe Goldhaber", "section": "news", "location": "state street", "source": "isthmus"}

Faced with calls to disavow Madison\u2019s novel legal argument that absentee votes do not enjoy a constitutional right to be counted, Madison Mayor Satya-Rhodes Conway has a different suggestion: state legislators should change a 1985 law referring to absentee voting as a \u201cprivilege.\u201d \u201cWhen a lawyer quotes the law, they're not saying they believe it,\u201d Rhodes-Conway says in an interview on Feb. 6. \u201cThey're just saying that's what the law says.\u201d She adds: \u201cIf we have a problem with that statement in law, in state law that is on the books, then we should be going to the Legislature and saying, \u2018Change that state law.\u2019 For the record, I do have a problem with it. I do think the Legislature should change that.\u201d In November 2024, the city of Madisonfailed to count193 absentee ballots, even though the then-City Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl was made aware of the error in time for it to be at least partially reversed. The uncounted votes did not affect the outcome of any races. The Wisconsin Elections Commission launched an investigation into the mistake, which ultimately found that Witzel-Behl violated five elections laws, andplacedseveral orders upon the city in August to ensure such a mistake does not occur again. And, in September, progressive law firm Law Forward filed a class action suit on behalf of eight plaintiffs. The firm is seeking $175,000 in damages for each voter disenfranchised. \u201cThe question really in this lawsuit is, when human error happens in a clerk's office, should that office have to pay up to millions of dollars?\u201d says Rhodes-Conway, who adds that the city's longstanding support of absentee voting has \"not changed.\" A judge has ruled that the city can be held liable for monetary damages. On Feb. 9, Dane County Circuit Court Judge David Conway declined to dismiss the case and ruled that the voters may seek monetary damages. \u201cThe court concludes that Wisconsin law recognizes a cause of action for damages against election officials who negligently deprive citizens of the right to vote,\u201d wrote Conway. The judge also ruled that \u201cjust because the absentee voting process is a privilege does not mean that those who legally utilize it do not exercise their constitutional right to vote.\u201d In a Feb. 11Milwaukee Journal Sentinelop-ed, Rhodes-Conway wrote that the city supports Conway's ruling regarding whether absentee votes are constitutionally protected and does not plan to contest it. The city\u2019s argument has been met with near-universal backlash. Both Gov. Tony Evers and the Wisconsin Elections Commission submitted amicus briefs in opposition. Howard Schweber, a UW-Madison professor emeritus who studies constitutional law, says the city\u2019s argument for dismissing the case was \u201cextraordinarily weak.\u201d Though Wisconsin\u2019s constitution does not explicitly require absentee voting, it does mandate that legally cast votes be counted. \u201cOnce absentee ballots are part of the [statutory voting] system, if the legal requirements are satisfied, there's a constitutional right to have those votes counted on the same basis as others,\u201d says Schweber. The question of damages, Schweber says, is where \u201cthe question gets much more interesting.\u201d Until Monday\u2019s decision, Wisconsin courts had not yet taken up the question of whether plaintiffs may seek damages for disenfranchisement, let alone that done negligently, Schweber says. Law Forward\u2019s choice to seek remuneration, in his view, is meant to deter other municipalities from making similar mistakes in the future. \u201cThe lawyers and the parties who are promoting this lawsuit want to see damages awarded because they're concerned that there needs to be some kind of serious incentive to compel districts to count absentee ballots,\u201d says Schweber. \u201cThe context of this is, of course, the coming 2026 midterms and the controversies we've had over the last three election cycles over absentee ballots.\u201d Precious Ayodabo, the lead plaintiff in the suit, made a similarargumentin a Feb. 8 op-ed inThe Capital Times: \u201cFrankly, it is not good enough that the city claims it\u2019ll do better next time.\u201d \u201cNo matter what the city says, I believe my vote is worth something,\u201d Ayodabo wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s worth enough that I waited for hours in line to cast it. It\u2019s worth enough that politicians spend millions of dollars to receive it. It\u2019s worth enough that people have put their lives on the line and died to protect it.\u201d But Schweber says, exposing municipalities to financial liability for accidentally not counting ballots \u2014 not to mention increased liability insurance costs \u2014 may create an incentive for state legislators to \u201cdiminish the availability of absentee voting across the board.\u201d \u201cThat could be a perverse incentive, an idea that was intended to help ensure that voting would be fair and easily available to backfire by imposing costs on the system unless they can certify perfect accuracy. And of course, no one can ever certify perfect accuracy,\u201d says Schweber. Rhodes-Conway concurs that allowing punitive damages for human errors in voting could lead to unforeseen issues. \u201cClerks offices are chronically underfunded across the state, and if we have to pay millions of dollars out to lawyers, that's money that won't be invested back into those clerks offices,\u201d says Rhodes-Conway. \u201cThat is a huge question and has huge negative implications for our state.\u201d Liam Beran City clerk Lydia McComas, left, says 'Making sure people can trust the system has been one of my priorities.' The city of Madison did adopt, without challenge, a set ofordersdrafted forit by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. It also implemented some changes that went beyond what the commission ordered, restructured the clerk\u2019s office, and revised training for poll workers. Lydia McComas, who has been city clerk since September, tellsIsthmusshe has \u201cno concern about our ability to count absentee ballots going forward.\u201d \u201cPart of the issue with the ballots in 2024 is that it wasn't clear to some inspectors, chief inspectors and election inspectors, where to find the absentee ballots,\u201d says McComas. \u201cFor this next election, ballots will only be delivered on election day, and they will be handed from city staff to the chief inspector on election morning. Ballots [we receive] throughout the day will be delivered to the chiefs.\u201d McComas is the former voter engagement division manager for Hennepin County, Minnesota, and replaced Witzel-Behl. McComas spoke withIsthmusat the Hawthorne Library, where officials on Feb. 7 conducted a public test of election equipment for the upcoming Feb. 17 spring primary. Early absentee voting began on Feb. 3 and will continue until Feb. 15. This is the first election McComas is administering in Wisconsin. Having begun the job just four months ago, McComas says the error from November has been on her mind. \u201cIn elections, it's important to get it right no matter what. So I don't see that that's really weighing on me any different,\u201d says McComas. \u201cBut I think the public trust aspect is, definitely.\u201d Adds McComas: \u201cI came from Minnesota, where everyone is very excited about voting, and that's the same in Wisconsin. People are really out there and have such high turnout in this state, which is wonderful. Making sure people can trust the system has been one of my priorities, and will continue to be one of my priorities.\u201d [Editor's note:\u00a0This articlehas been corrected to note that absentee voting concludes Feb. 15, not Feb. 17, and to remove a sentence that said the city could not contest Conway's decision.] byLiam Beran February 11, 2026 10:10 AM", "date": "2026-02-11", "author": "byLiam Beran", "section": "news", "location": "general madison", "source": "isthmus"}

She is part of a group of parents who have raised concerns about the performance of Van Hise principal Rebecca Stein and she tries to keep up with school board meetings. She rates the board\u2019s performance \u201cfine, but not amazing,\u201d but is a fan of seven-year board member Nicki Vander Meulen, whom she says \u201cmakes it a lot easier as a parent to understand what\u2019s going on\u201d by asking questions at board meetings and sharing information on social media. Nevertheless she is okay with the fact that both incumbents on the April 7 ballot \u2014 including Vander Meulen \u2014 have challengers. \u201cCompetition forces people to articulate what they stand for. Otherwise, it\u2019s pretty hard to know what\u2019s important to them.\u201d One of Robertson\u2019s concerns is with the school board\u2019s lack of clarity over how the district is spending the funds raised through the November 2024 referendum \u2014 $100 million for operating funds and $507 million for capital projects. Combined, the referendums add $676 in annual property taxes on the average-value Madison home, estimated to be around $481,000. The capital funds are being used tosupportrenovations at 10 schools while the operating funds are for staff pay and benefits increases, and to support existing district services. The resulting property tax increases, says Robertson, are pushing her to the \u201cmax\u201d of what she can afford: \u201cThose [referendums] look a lot more real on a property tax bill than a ballot.\u201d Attendees at a Jan. 13 candidate forum held by the Lapham Marquette Parent-Teacher Group raised other concerns about the board,includingwhether members ensure that parental complaints are brought to the attention of administrative officials. Parents also wanted to see action to improve student safety and address principal turnover at the district\u2019s middle schools. Despite some discontent with the school board\u2019s operations, there has been little interest in recent years in running for the board. In 2024 both candidates running for reelection were unopposed; in 2025 there was onlyone competitive race. The board\u2019s president and vice president, Nichelle Nichols and Maia Pearson, have never faced a competitive race during their tenure on the board. Nichols has been on the board since 2022; Pearson has been on the board since 2021. This year, Dana Colussi-Lynde is running against Vander Meulen and Daniella Molle is taking on two-year member Blair Mosner-Feltham. The challengers say they\u2019re representing constituencies not currently on the board. Molle, an immigrant, says she would serve as a voice for bilingual and multilingual students; Colussi-Lynde, who notes she is neither a teacher nor a parent of a student in the Madison district, says she would represent the average taxpayer. Says Colussi-Lynde: \u201cEven if our politics aren\u2019t necessarily super different, it\u2019s always better to have more voices and more diverse backgrounds. That\u2019s how you\u2019re going to have more innovation, more broad coverage for the topics that you\u2019re talking about, because you don\u2019t ever want to be making those kinds of decisions in a silo.\u201d Why hasn\u2019t Madison seen moreschool board candidates in recent years? Michael Ford, an Oshkosh school board member and UW-Oshkosh professor who studies school board governance, says that the advantage enjoyed by incumbents might scare away newcomers. \u201cIf someone has name recognition, especially in these historically low turnout local elections, that matters a great deal,\u201d says Ford. Ford also says that while the \u201cprimary role\u201d of a school board is to better students\u2019 academic outcomes, discontent with academic achievement is not a factor driving most school board races across the country. Hot-button social issues are, though it\u2019s unlikely in deep-blue Madison that a group like Moms for Liberty, which has worked in recent years to get conservatives elected to school boards, would be that successful, adds Ford. Teacher unions also play a role, as endorsements and financial contributions can significantly boost a candidate\u2019s viability and union members can both campaign door to door and raise money for candidates. \u201cIt certainly does matter a great deal from a financial aspect,\u201d says Ford. In Madison, each school board candidate endorsed by the union has won her race since 2022. In 2025 Madison Teachers Inc. endorsed Martha Siravo, who ran against Bret Wagner, for an open school board seat. The union contributed $5,000 to her campaign \u2014 near the maximum $5,240 limit for political action committees \u2014 and Siravo won with 55% of the vote. Colussi-Lynde is a Madison Westgraduate with more than 25 years of experience in the IT industry. She says her top priorities are addressing classroom safety, creating a policy for student usage of artificial intelligence, and clarifying property tax spending. \u201cIt\u2019s our job as a school board to ensure that our constituents and our community understand where that money is going and what it\u2019s being used for, and that it\u2019s being used responsibly,\u201d says Colussi-Lynde. \u201cFunding is really complicated\u2026it\u2019s our job to make sure that people do understand how this is done.\u201d She says her background in technology will help her find efficiencies to reduce spending. At the Jan. 13 candidate forum she suggested that the district evaluate its software subscriptions to see what could potentially be trimmed. Molle, who immigrated to the United States from Bulgaria in 2003, has lived in Madison for 21 years. She currently works as a researcher at UW-Madison\u2019s Wisconsin Center for Education Research, where she studies equity in public school leadership. Her scholarship, she says, piqued her interest in running for school board. \u201cI gained an appreciation for the importance of school boards in supporting equity-focused work at the district level,\u201d says Molle. One of her top priorities if elected to the board would be to strengthen staff support for the district\u2019s bilingual education programs and services for multilingual students. Trump\u2019s election, she says, also pushed her to seek office. Molle says that having contested races \u201cincreases the legitimacy of the school board\u201d as a governing body. \u201cI feel like democracy is falling apart at the federal level. It has been motivating to be engaged locally, because what use is democracy if you have an uncontested race?\u201d byLiam Beran February 5, 2026 11:00 AM", "date": "2026-02-05", "author": "byLiam Beran", "section": "news", "location": "general madison", "source": "isthmus"}

The outcome of alawsuitover Madison\u2019s failure to count 193 absentee ballots in the 2024 presidential election looms over future elections. The impact could be significant: More voters are casting absentee ballots and Wisconsin\u2019s statewide elections are often decided by very close margins. President Trump won Wisconsin last November by only 29,397 votes out of 3.3 million votes cast. A veteran member of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, Don Millis, says Madison\u2019s legal response to the lawsuit filed over the uncounted ballots is similar to the November 2020 attempt by President Trump\u2019s campaign to throw out more than 200,000 absentee ballots cast in Dane and Milwaukee counties. Wrong, says Madison City Attorney Michael Haas. \u201cThe city\u2019s legal position bears no resemblance to the unserious effort to invalidate all absentee ballots that were lawfully cast and counted as part of the attempt to support the fake elector scheme and overturn the results of the valid 2020 election,\u201d says Haas in an email statement. \u201cMadison has a long history of supporting absentee voting and has been a leader in promoting and protecting that option and will continue to do so,\u201d adds Haas, a former staff counsel to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Haas says the lawsuit filed by some voters whose absentee ballots were not counted could set a dangerous precedent for all local governments whose clerks conduct elections. \u201cThe primary issue in the lawsuit is whether the state Constitution or state statutes allow voters to recover money from a municipality when their absentee ballots are inadvertently not timely counted in an election,\u201d Haas says. Madison \u201ctakes this effort to create new law seriously and opposes it because, in addition to affecting [Madison], it will also affect municipalities across the state which could be on the hook to pay damages whenever a human error is made by election staff or poll workers,\u201d Haas adds. Millis objects to the primary argument made by the city\u2019s lawyers in their response to the lawsuit that seeks damages for uncounted votes. In a court filing, the lawyers, representing former Madison Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl, who resigned in the wake of the uncounted ballots, and city officials, say that voters lost their constitutional right to vote when they cast absentee ballots. Voters who sued \u201cdescribe the right to vote as \u2018fundamental\u2019 and \u2018sacred,\u2019 and cite a century-old precedent that the right to vote \u2018may not under our Constitution be destroyed or even unreasonably restricted,\u2019\u201d the filing reads. \u201cThese points are undoubtedly true. However, the manner in which [voters] exercised their right to vote \u2014 by absentee ballot \u2014 took the process out of its core constitutional protection. When the absentee process unfortunately results in a vote not being counted, it is not a violation of a constitutional right.\u201d Madison has a long history of supporting absentee voting, says city attorney Haas. Wrong, Millis says in a statement. A Republican appointee to the Elections Commission, he has been a member of boards and commissions overseeing elections for years. \u201cWhile the option to cast an absentee ballot is not guaranteed by the Constitution, as soon as Wisconsin permitted absentee voting, voters casting absentee ballots in accordance with law have the absolute constitutional right to have their votes counted,\u201d Millis says. Millis says the city\u2019s argument is basically what the Trump campaign argued after Trump failed to secure a second term in November 2000: that voters who follow the rules to cast their ballots have no constitutional right to have their vote counted, as hewrotein an opinion column for theMilwaukee Journal Sentinel. Wisconsin judges ultimately rejected the argument from Trump campaign lawyers that more than 200,000 \u201cabsentee ballots cast in Dane and Milwaukee counties should not be counted.\u201d In a Jan. 23statement, Madison officials said \u201call forms of voting \u2014 including absentee voting \u2014 should be encouraged, promoted and protected.\u201d \u201cA mistake was made,\u201d city officials added. But, \u201cOur laws do not provide voters with monetary compensation for mishandling an absentee ballot\u2026[A]ttaching a dollar value to a vote, when human mistakes occur in elections, would end up regularly costing cities, towns and municipalities hundreds, thousands \u2014 or in this case millions \u2014 of dollars.\u201d In a legalbrieffiled in the case, Gov. Tony Evers also said there is a constitutional right to cast an absentee ballot. Madison officials didn\u2019t report the 193 uncounted absentee ballots for weeks, which prompted an Elections Commission investigation thatfoundthat laws were broken and recommended changes in city procedures. Haas says Madison officials have made changes to make sure the November error is not repeated. Steven Walters started covering the Capitol in 1988.
