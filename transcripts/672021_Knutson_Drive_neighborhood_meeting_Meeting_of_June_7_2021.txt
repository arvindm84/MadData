============================================================

 So this with this meeting being recorded that it basically means it's a public record so anyone can obtain the recording so by continuing your consenting to be recorded. I put together a little agenda here we don't have to stick to these times but just putting it up for your information and we can go longer than seven o'clock if if it needs to but we can do since we have a smaller group we could do some introductions and then I'll go over I've got like a very short presentation to go over to the kind of just the background information and the history and things and then the different options and then we can just open it up to discussing it so maybe let's go around and just introduce yourself and maybe say whether you're a resident of Knutson or or somewhere else and then yeah so Alder Meadze if you want to go first. I'm Alder Meadze I live on Drury Lane over here close to a fire station I've been on Knutson Drive quite a few times actually I was on there before I came to this meeting I actually took a drive down the street and yep just glad that everybody was able to show up. Who wants to go next Mark? Mark and Marianne we live on 4306 Green Avenue which is basically at the corner almost of Green and Knutson we've been here since 88 as the past the vice president of the neighborhood association this has been something that we've voiced to numerous all the people in the past without getting any resolutions. Could you hear? Thanks Larry Miller would you like to go next? Sure sure my name's Larry Miller I live on Knutson Drive 30 Knutson down at the bottom just before it called us acts I've been here for about 15 years and this is you know I'm here because this has been a topic of conversation since we first moved in from the very beginning it was our understanding that Knutson was going to be widened and I know it's come up many times and looking forward to moving forward with it. Thanks Jim Krause. Yeah hi I'm Jim Krause I'm here with my wife Katie we live in the 18th district we live a couple blocks away from Knutson on Vieth Avenue we live we travel that Knutson road daily probably two three times a day and we've witnessed not so frequent on the street but we have witnessed it and when there is parking on one side it's actually very challenging because if there's oncoming traffic one of the vehicles has to stop to allow enough passageway. Also I would say Knutson Drive going down that hill it's dangerous in the winter time especially when it gets icy and the road's kind of been rough shaped it's in need of repairs in my opinion. I'm a friend of Charles but I'm really happy that Charles won the election. Your audio is cutting out for us. That's all I had to say so if you want me to repeat something I'd be happy to. No that's okay I just wanted to let you know we've been talking about this for a while and I just wanted to let you know we couldn't hear all of it but that's okay got the gist. Okay so am I next? Yes okay I'm Meg Hannah live here with my husband Rick at 209 Knutson which is the first house up the hill on the north side of Knutson in the area that we're actually talking about tonight and we've been here for six years and I've really never had a problem with the parking situation we never have people you know if we have people over they park in our driveway we've never really parked on the street or had friends park on the street other people do people I don't know but I've never seen it as as a problem the one problem I do see about Knutson is that we've got a really steep hill here and there's a lot of speeding people just come flying down that hill and in my opinion and from you know the little bit that I know when you have a narrower street with more vehicles parked on the sides it forces people to slow down and what I worry about with widening Knutson or making sure that there's no parking on it is that things are just going to get faster and faster and we're going to have more accidents because of that I'm surprised there haven't been more people crashing into someone at the stop sign our neighbors across the street have had their mailbox taken out like five or six times in the years that they've been here and one of the reasons we bought here is because we actually liked the slightly more rural feel rather than the sort of you know corporate rigid curb and gutter sidewalk further down on Knutson I don't mean that necessarily pejoratively it's just you know it's two different looks and two different feels and we like it the way it is also I have to say that we wouldn't really be too happy about having to pay ten thousand dollars to have things widened but that's another discussion tonight we're talking about parking so I don't know exactly who's been complaining about it I know that the neighbors here that I've talked to have not had a problem with it thanks well I've got a short presentation maybe I'll go through that quickly and then we can kind of open it up to the discussion so I'm going to I'm just going to mute everyone so there's no background noise so and Meg is correct so there's kind of two things here there's a long-term reconstruction of Knutson which there's nothing currently planned for that and then there's kind of the interim what to do prior to that to more or less a band-aid to a problem so we're talking about what we would do prior to or in the interim between now and a reconstruction project so I just wanted to go through the development of the area because kind of like when we get issues like these or complaints sometimes it has to do with a new building being built or a grocery store or a gas station or something that draws additional traffic but so here's the area in 2000 you can see there's still some houses to be built down here kind of towards the south everything north in the north area is pretty much already built 2004 pretty much all the houses are built by 2004 there's a couple open lots but it's pretty much the way it looks like right now is what it looked like about 15 years ago so here's 2020 so yeah really not a lot of development not a lot of changes in the past 10 to 15 years not a lot of changes in the past 10 to 15 years this is a traffic volume map so you can see it might be hard to read but so north port drive has about 23 24 25 000 vehicles per day canoes and drive is close to 4000 between 3000 4000 and then green avenue is right around 3000 and then these dashed lines in the in the neighborhood streets means that it's less than a thousand so i just pulled up the crashes kind of my whole area the whole neighborhood so this is for five years these are reportable crashes so that means someone was injured or there was at least a thousand dollars in damage to a vehicle see a lot of crashes at north port and kennedy just kind of as a reference of high crash areas north port of school for canoes and drive in this area there were only really two crashes in the five years from 2015 through 2019 there was one crash here at west port at the intersection one crash done by green avenue and those i have i looked at the crash reports for those they both involved high speeding the one at green avenue was a hit and run it kind of um i think that one was kind of like a road rage situation that sounded like and then the one at west port was just a single vehicle that was going too fast and didn't make the turn and crash into a vehicle so really the crash history is not really showing a problem um this is the dimensions of the street so canoes and drive just based off the aerial is about 22 feet from the edge of pavement to the edge of pavement and these black rectangles represent cars so this is what it would look like you'd only have about 10 and a half feet of width between parked cars if they were parked entirely within the pavement directly across from each other and this is kind of you know just what it would look like if someone was parked off the pavement and then these dash black lines are the right of way line so you can just see how far into people's yards the right of way actually is and like it was mentioned before for reconstruction project that would likely typically you look at adding sidewalk curb and gutter sidewalk and everything that gets you know on a typical street the sidewalk is about a foot off the right of way line uh that's saying that's for sure what would happen here during a reconstruction project but that's just kind of like what a typical street looks like so here is um this is from google street view just uh or no this i think this might have been a photo from uh that was emailed to us of cars parked entirely within the pavement and this is from street view so here's someone parking kind of off the pavement he's parking in a driveway but uh so for options um things that we can do moving forward we could keep everything the same just just not touch it leave parking the way it is um we could this is a plan to paint a center line so with the center line it's you know there a point was brought up at the center line on westport road from our record westport is a couple feet wider than knutson i was looking closer at the aerials today i don't it's hard to tell if that's true or not we're going to have to go out there and measure just to make sure but um with with a narrow pavement you can't it's difficult to mark a center line if people can't stay on that half so we could look further into that but um that really doesn't putting the center line doesn't isn't going to really solve the problem of the parking so this was a plan um that we did on a different street where we had a situation like this where it was no curb and gutter and we just tried wanted to get people to park off the pavement so we just put in signs that say no parking on pavement to try to get people to park uh like this person's parking kind of on the shoulder if you're encroaching a little bit into the pavement i don't think that's going to be an issue but uh just kind of a reminder to keep the street clear but we actually got feedback i think it was from a resident that's not in this meeting that they felt that the residents on knutson would rather have one side of the parking removed then do this plan because with this plan they were worried about um in the winter during rain kind of tearing up that grass area so that they would rather be able to park a little bit on the pavement but maybe just one side so that's another option is just removing parking from one side entirely whether it's the north side or the south side i don't know that's kind of what we would want feedback from the residents and when we make a big parking change like that we typically have the residents sign a petition saying that that's what they want um and we talked about that we never got a petition back so this was just kind of left in limbo for a while um prior to this meeting and so kind of the feedback that we've gotten is that people that don't live on knutson um think there's a problem but people that do live on knutson don't think there's a problem and generally don't want things changed that's kind of the impression that we got as as the city i checked with the fire department they said um one of the fire uh chiefs who's been with the fire department for 30 years said he's never had an issue in his career he's never heard of an issue it it sounds like it's a problem or it it seems to me that it's a problem that is fairly infrequent but when it does happen if someone's parked directly across from each other you can create some issues but i kind of look for a comparative street in the city like this um and there aren't a lot of good examples that where a street is like knutson that has the volume that knutson has but it also has this parking setup with the narrow street so typically when a street's like this it's lower volume and it's not really much of an issue so that's a little bit of a background this is just a another view of that um so yeah i guess from the city standpoint we don't really have a strong preference either way of what's done with the parking from our records we don't we don't have a record of there being an issue and uh in the past and that's why i showed those aerials because nothing really has changed recently that would you know that that would make it seem like something is coming up that hasn't been there before the volume should be pretty much the same as what they have been for the past 10 years and we kind of we look back at our records to see if there was other complaints and we didn't have them so that's kind of our reluctance to make a change here because a lot of times when we make changes thinking that some we're going to fix it and it ends up creating an issue somewhere else and we would have been better off just not doing anything so but that's why we're having this meeting so um i think just moving forward um if we did want to make some sort of change with a situation like this where there's not really a consensus of what people want to see really a consensus of what people want to do if that if that is the case then we would probably have this discussed at a transportation commission meeting so then that would be a public meeting where residents or members of the public can speak for three minutes and the commission can ask questions of the residents and we would present all the data and then the commission would discuss it and and come up with a plan to move forward whether it would be doing nothing or removing parking so that's kind of where we're at right now i think i think we could probably just if if we just wanted to open up to questions i was hoping that we would get a few more people at this meeting so for the anyway for the for a transportation commission meeting if that were to happen um i don't know aldermiyadze we'd probably do another mailing just to let people know that was coming up at that meeting is that how that would work yeah i'll send out another mailing and uh if we can't come up on something that's tangible to everybody this evening we'll set it to transportation then we can have a further discussion but no no matter what i'll be hearing what everybody's concerns are of course so does anyone have anything to add um i do may go ahead um two points one is that oops i just lost can you still hear oh there it goes okay it's back again um um i correct me if i'm wrong tom but i believe that the underpass on troy is in the design and planning stages and that is going to be widened and that alone is going to take a lot of the truck traffic and um you know large vehicles off of knutson at least in my opinion it will because that's a direct route um that should be taking more traffic and it can't because of the small underpass so i'm i'm thinking that once we get that done uh it might take a little bit of pressure off of knutson in terms of traffic the other thing i wanted to mention is that when this part of knutson drive was built all of the houses had swales uh because we don't have storm sores here and that makes parking off the pavement um more difficult because it's really pretty slanted in some places and um it's not necessarily impossible to to park off the streets and in some houses it's easier than others but you can see um that there is a slant and especially when things are wet and there's snow um you know it's it's i think that's going to be difficult i would personally rather have parking on the pavement um because i don't first of all i don't want to have my grass torn up but also because i think it's going to be easier for people to do um i can't offhand think of anything else um except that especially recently i think since we heard about this last year i really haven't seen hey that's us getting our soffits done um i don't think that uh there's been nearly as much parking on the street i i've seen less parking on the street over the last year to two years than i did before oh one other thing is um in terms of the speeding i think that that's certainly a factor when you have the narrower road and people speeding down knutson um you know it would be great if we could have some sort of speed bumps or something although i understand that that's difficult to do when you don't have curves because people can go around them but um i think the speeding issue is one of the the main issues on this street thanks yeah i can so a couple things about that i think we can collect some new data on knutson i think our volumes for just our regular accounts that we do every few years so um yeah we can we can collect some data and get some speeding data and the volume data just uh for our information is it probably right around here where i'm at here on the map where the speeding is the worst because it's from people coming down the hill or if we were to place the post counters around 213 i don't really notice the speeding from where we're sitting on our front porch as much as much as just the people having to weave around each other because the road isn't wide enough yeah and the other thing i was going to address from meg's comment about the narrow street and slowing down that's definitely true and that is kind of the way that the city is moving is to trying to tighten streets up narrow things we're back like in the 90s and 80s suburban streets were built 40 feet wide and now we're dealing with all the speeding problems on those streets so anytime you widen things up speeds go up so um it's kind of a situation where things oftentimes when they feel unsafe can sometimes make them safer because they feel unsafe and people drive more cautiously so that's one of what would be one of the unintended consequences of removing parking is that you can pretty much guarantee that speeds are not going to go down by removing parking that that they may that they will probably go up so we'll at least collect some baseline speed data so we have that and see just how bad the problem is right now the only concern i have tom is that you know i moved in in 88 okay and knutson did not go all the way through it stopped right on green avenue okay and since i've been here that street has not been had any major work any restoration done in that life i'm sure asphalt doesn't have a life over 25 years and it's well past that secondly is is that when i was on the neighborhood association as the vice president we were told that they weren't going to do anything to that road because there was an assessment issued like three years prior to that so they weren't going to do anything to those that road because of they wanted that current assessment to run out well five years later we asked about it again and they said well there's no plans no plans and so the question is is that you know knutson has been there in its same existence when there were 12 homes down here now to where there's 234 homes here okay so the fact is is that it's an emergency route you know the fire department the police department they come down here they don't come down troy it's a bus lane that goes up and it's terrible in the winter with the buses trying to go up the hill and us going up the hill the sun that blares down in your face in the morning okay you know i noticed that your accident report didn't show the two bicycle accidents that happened at the corner of green and knutson where two bicycles were were hit coming down from that street so i'm just concerned is that you know if you go down to look at knutson it's not 40 feet wide you know the lower part of knutson is 32 feet from curb to curb when you look at the how you guys did the curb when you redid knutson or when you redid green that we didn't have any voice and you guys just decided to do it you know the apron going up to knutson where the curb stops is 36 feet from inside the curb to inside the curb and then goes down to 22 feet you know you've and if i'm not mistaken you basically said that you already the city already owns the right away that's going to be much wider than the street is currently correct so i'm just wondering is what's what's you know and if we need a petition i'm sure that the neighbors here and probably not the ones in knutson and i can understand their position but i mean the the other 234 homes that use this on a regular basis would you know we could get a petition together really quickly to say hey we'd like to see something done with knutson how many people were sent to female for this today because i have neighbors i talked to that knew nothing about this meeting so i'm curious how this was sent out to knutson and what did you guys think well i also posted on my blog and also i had the city sent out postcards so there was um postcards sent out to everybody on knutson oh only on knutson yes okay so that doesn't affect okay i was gonna say because our neighbors on green knew nothing yeah we sent it out to knutson yeah um so that's why they're not that big a turnout so larry you had something you're muted larry very you're on mute okay i'm sorry i'm not sure how i got on mute uh you know when we were looking at this meeting a couple of weeks ago and we talked about it we chose not to make this a mob meeting of you know i've talked to dozens of people on knutson and money on my streets uh and in our neighborhood over the last couple of weeks and over the last couple of months in the last couple of years and this is always a problem and i think that's one of the reasons why we're doing this we talked about this a couple weeks ago do we want to rile up a bunch of people and bring them to this meeting and make it a mob meeting i've certainly seen those before we chose not to but as uh mark was saying you know we have the support of literally hundreds of households that have been wanting this to be changed uh and we've been able to do that and we've been able to do that have been wanting this to be changed uh for a decade the decades uh and if we if it's necessary to get a headcount or to get some indication of the support that we have for this it's it will be easy for us to do a petition if if that's the process we want to go through you know historically you talk time you talked about the history of this i mean originally this was knutson served all of 11 houses it was a nice little country road it was one block long uh then they built our neighborhood it's it's uh you know it's now we've got 230 houses in this as you point out this is the main route of entry uh into our neighborhood not only do we have uh all the people but you know the delivery trucks the amazon trucks and everything else that come through here i don't see that being routed to troy drive uh because of the number of stop signs and in fact i think charles may may be able to speak to this i think there's an emphasis to reduce the traffic on troy drive of it's they're going to put in more uh signs maybe bumps or something like that i think that's part of the effort so uh i i expect the traffic and uh i'm knutson to to be as great or as or even more uh this you know the pandemic really illustrated the point if somebody wants to walk on the street or ride their bicycle on the street it's dangerous uh two cars cannot pass comfortably of you know if even people somebody going out you can see if somebody's out there going to their mailbox uh their car and their lane has to shift over and that doesn't give enough room for the person that that's coming from the opposite direction and time you talked about comparable roads and looking at the the north side the road that we found that what seemed to be the the most comparable to this as far as a profile would be school road which is only a half a mile away of it's got it's flying at the top it's got about the same profile it's about the same run out ends at a stop sign of and school road is a nice wide road there's room for cars to pass comfortably there are sidewalks on both sides so people can walk safely up it bicycles can go on it i see there's a there's there's there's accidents but that's at the bottom where school road feeds into packers and that's that's not surprising there's a lot of a lot of accidents up and down packers and that's the reason why I think that's one of the most important issues so this is just this is something that we have been wanting to get done for a long long time and quite frankly it's it's kind of a mystery why why not do it if we widen the kitchen that would solve the whole parking question uh i know that the biggest issue that has come up whenever we've was the assessment would change and people would have to pay for that portion of improvement curb and gutter what we're asking for is canoots and to be widened only to the extent that lower canoots it is you know just make it contiguous with the the canoots and that's down below green you know just just make upper canoots in the same as the lower canoots and you know the this notion that speeding is going to happen we don't see a lot of speeding on lower canoots you know it's wider it's broader there's parking on both sides but you know we don't see cars ripping by on lower canoots and so this idea that we're going to if we expand the street that's going to make it dangerously fast i'm not buying it because there are lots of roads on the north side of that have hills that are plenty wide you know get sheridan sherman like we mentioned school road firewell road all of these have large hills but they're they're comfortably wide for people to pass so this is you know something that we were expecting to happen uh you know decades ago in fact it's a kind of an interesting history of how this didn't get widened when this neighborhood was built it was due to be widened but uh of an individual up in the hill who worked for the city streets division department uh had a big hand in in keeping it uh from being widened but uh uh that's what we'd like to see is is get it widened to the same same level as lower canoots um can i make uh yeah okay um first of all concerning my husband and i live i right where that blue car is that's our old subaru uh so we are retired we're looking we've got big front windows we see what's happening all the time and i can assure you there is lots of speeding i've seen very large trucks coming down at speeds where i'm amazed that they've been able to stop um and just individual cars but um all range of vehicles very fast we don't see that lower canootson yeah well i i maybe because there's just not as much traffic but um the other thing is that um we had a meeting here at our house a few years ago i tom i can't remember if i i don't believe that you were here it was a woman who was here uh from the city to talk about the widening issue of canootson and it was also for westport road because they are of the same vintage and the city was planning to do both streets at the same time and one of the things that we also brought up is that widening the road and putting in curb and gutter is first of all creating a lot more impervious surface and it's putting the runoff into the storm source instead of having it go through the ground where it will actually go into the aquifer and instead of carrying all that stuff straight into the lakes and polluting the lakes and we're i think that a lot of the people in the neighborhood are very interested in that and the person who was here from the city said that the city was actually looking for a demonstration project area where they could put in something other than standard curb and gutter and instead allow storm water to percolate through um you know some sort of swale system there are other examples that people brought up from you know minnesota and and other places where they've done these sorts of things i think that if the street is going to be rebuilt we really ought to look into that sort of thing instead of just going with the standard thing that we've always done that we know has negative consequences in terms of the environment let's branch out and consider some other things i would feel much better about my money going toward that instead of the standard curb and gutter and as for the parking which was the original topic of this um i frankly don't have a whole lot of uh interest either way i mean i i don't see the parking as a problem especially these last couple of years like i said there's been very little the only thing that i really don't want is off pavement parking where people are going to be parking on the grass and in the winter when the snow plows come through no one will be able to park off the pavement except in people's driveways so i think that parking on one side is a reasonable compromise and if we didn't do anything i'd be fine with that too thanks so yeah the only problem i see with parking on one side is that it essentially makes it a one lane road well it's not like we have a whole lot of of parking here and you know it's really just particular times like right now our neighbors across the street are having a roof replaced so there are a number of vehicles mostly parked off the street um or you know there's an empty lot across the street which when the realtor is there uh you know you've got like five different pickup trucks sitting there i mean but it doesn't last very long um and winding you know having to go around a vehicle i mean i just don't see it as that much of a problem people go more slowly they'll be more careful if there are accidents like you know you hit another car or something you're going slower so there's less damage people are less likely to get hurt um i just don't see a problem i think that would be a lot less of a problem if the road didn't have that going up because the hill is one of the big issues exactly the limited site distance right and the width of it i mean that's the width is really the the major issue here is you know it's it's narrow okay um you know tom i think you can speak to the runoff yeah before we get to that just in terms of the width if i could just ask a question and we'll get to the runoff issue momentarily um are there other streets this particular width with this amount of traffic well yeah that's kind of what i was looking i was trying to find um streets like this where it's unimproved in this width um with this much traffic i couldn't find one they're typically lower volume in this but is that because this could is could that be because this is on the outskirts of the city we're only a few hundred yards from the city limits out to westport and uh i think there's a term for ruralization that you know rural roads have become city roads and i always thought this was part of it because it's just on the very outskirts of the city it's never been it's never been improved not only that too but people using it as a corridor to get through probably to make up time for uh you know since they can't go other routes in order to get to green avenue or knutson that people actually use that time to speed up and uh you know in order to get get things delivered or get through so not a lot of places around on the north side are and there's no other options it's not like uh you know you can bypass can you uh you know the to speak to the topic that came up briefly that maryann mentioned is the and which hadn't been talked about is just the limited sight distance which exacerbates the the narrowness of the road it means one thing if you've got a flat and level road and it's very narrow and you can see a half a mile down the road and and you can see if there's a car coming but you get close to the top of this hill and it's you can't tell if another car is going to come cresting over that hill and so if somebody is parked on the right hand side and you have to swing swing way to the left or somebody's out there riding a bicycle or getting their mail and you've got to swing way way to the left you just kind of pray that somebody's not coming over the top of that hill uh whereas if it was nice and wide you'd have plenty of comfort within your own lane instead of having a swing now so somebody said well you know the bus drivers have not complained about it and the fire truckers have not complained about it but they're sitting about eight feet off the ground and it doesn't surprise me that they have no problem with limited sight distance because they can they're a lot higher for the for the average person that's in a Prius it's 16 inches off the ground you have such a limited sight distance over this hill that it's scary if you've got to get out of your lane because somebody's parked there or because somebody is is in your lane riding a bicycle or walking up the hill the this the hill really exacerbates the narrowness of this road and that's what it you know a lot of people's opinion i think what makes it so dangerous is is i mean the narrow is is a comfort thing but with that hill there the narrowness makes it dangerous uh if i could just um you know put in a comment here um i we use canoes and all all the time since we live right there um and i've never noticed that problem i've never noticed a problem with a poor sight line not being able to see a car coming i've just i have never been surprised by a car turning off of westport or out of cwc um it just hasn't been a problem in my experience at all i i've probably since 88 i've probably been missed being hit by somebody running the stop sign on westport road probably two dozen times where i had to divert and go over and almost go into central colony i've never had that experience in the six years nothing even close jim you want you have something yes i just wanted to say the sight line issue in my opinion i agree completely with what larry had to say it's really an issue going up the hill um and even going down the hill it's an issue i mean we witnessed that probably every third time we're on the road especially during busier traffic hours and i'll stop there things coming up the hill so it sounds like it's a real um it would be a real help to slow the traffic down the trap the the trap is slow enough well then my suggestion is that we should make it a one lane road and we all have horse and buggy well it sounds like so is the kind of the thinking that even just removing one side parking is not going to be enough is that uh is that kind of right we would like to see it widen to the same dimensions as lower canoes and just make it the same as uh the other the other street i i think one of the reasons that that one mailbox she said was taken out five times is party with the west uh it was at night um cars speeding by down the hill um there was probably alcohol involved although you don't really know for sure but they were uh you know like hit and run sort of things where there was no other traffic because some of those mailboxes are much closer to the road that others because there are parts of that road that are five feet narrower than other parts of it well i mean mailboxes have to be accessible to the to the mail delivery people um but i mean these were incidents i mean i we can we can certainly check with with jone and pam but from what they told me these were incidents where there was no other traffic on the road it was at night it was someone speeding with no other cars involved what's the width of uh the upper canoes and versus the bottom portion we know it's i think tom's numbers say it's 22 feet at the upper part of canoes and and from curb to curb on lower canoes and it's 32 feet that's the road itself not the actual curb so in between there it gets as narrow as no that's it's 22 22 so well i think today the uh the the goal of the meeting is not to make any kind of decisions or recommendations concerning widening the road it's really uh what to do about the parking and in terms of the parking um i'm really okay with anything as long as people are not parking off the pavement on the grass i almost stopped and asked somebody if because i i did take a drive by canoetson today and i saw the the construction that as you mentioned the guys on the roof and everybody parked off onto the grass i noticed there um so was there a warning that went out to everybody as far as making sure that everybody's parking off the street or well it was uh i think it was it was after the pandemic started was it about almost a year ago was it last fall i can't remember um when um the proposal was to make the parking off the pavement and um at that time people were sometimes you know parking on the street that i think that the people in the neighborhood were then aware because of this request to have parking off the pavement uh that maybe it would be better to make sure that visitors always park off the street so i think that it has been better i don't think it was a anything official but um as as a neighbor as neighbors we've been trying to keep the street clear i mean it seems like there's been several meetings with those people who live on canoetson about what they want to do with canoetson when the people who actually the majority of the people that use it on a daily basis don't have any input whatsoever i mean you talked about meetings about runoff and you know saving the lakes and stuff like that we never get involved in those uh you know you just talked about how you got together to try to keep people off the pavement and park on site we didn't know anything about those meetings there was nothing ever sent us that was not um that was not a meeting that was just neighbors talking with each other okay so um it it's the fact is is that i i see it and and i'll just say it one last time is that that road was built to accommodate a much less traffic area with a lot less homes and now there's 234 homes that it supports with the emergency vehicles with a bus route with a lot of kids you know now in the neighborhood i've tried to ride bikes up and down there the snow issue when it's plowed and how difficult it is to get up there with you don't have a almost an all-wheel drive vehicle sometimes uh so it's just a road that i think just needs some attention to to improve it to the fact that it's more user friendly to those other people rather than just those that live on the on the street and i understand those people that live on the street but i'm just saying as i think you know uh when my curb got cracked and you know the i and i had to pay nine hundred dollars because the city plow cracked it i didn't have any say in that okay uh so so well you're certainly welcome to pay our ten thousand dollars then you know and the fact is is that you know when those homes were built when my home when i bought the lot i paid for all those assessments when i purchased the home you probably had a lot less sale you know the lots were probably a lot cheaper because they didn't have those assessments they didn't have the road improvements so i mean i paid for those when i bought the lot you know certainly the theory i'm not sure how that actually works out in practice but like i said that's really not the issue here the issue is what we're going to do about the parking well the the issue is is that we've been complaining and sending notes to the city engineer my wife and i for quite a while now because it's not just a parking issue we show the parking we show the parking concerns but we're more concerned about the safety on the road and that's the easiest way to show is because there's people parked on both sides of the road so um my understanding was this was not going to be a parking discussion but here again there was a lot of input onto what the agenda was going to be and so forth so and if i missed something i thought this was only a parking meeting and that's what i'm saying is i think it was set out to be that but i think it was something that we as the neighbors in lower part of knutson thought was going to be more of a road issue rather than just a parking issue so right this has been something that has been going on as i mentioned before for for decades so tom of you know this won't go away it's been something that's come up before if it transcends this meeting of what is the process that we need to follow to get knutson widened i mean do we need to do we need to do a petition of as there's you know you talked about a committee meeting that that a representative could go in front of and talk i mean what is we thought this was going to be the first step in going down that path so what uh it doesn't sound like we're going to make any resolutions on on parking because there really isn't doesn't even be any consensus about that uh to widen the how do we go about getting the road widened properly so that it matches lower knutson yeah so just the typical process that so city engineering chooses the street reconstruction projects they kind of have like a five year out what they're planning what they're thinking to do for reconstruction projects and that's mostly based in the past is it's pretty much primarily been based on the age and the age and the inference infrastructure mostly under the streets the utilities and then somewhat based on the curb and gutter state of the pavement state because they they rate those things they keep an updated rating of all those just in the past couple years they've kind of added um injury crashes to that and addressing streets that have injury crashes so the high injury network so this street and that's probably why can it has been pushed off because there hasn't been a really a reported crash issue and there hasn't um the life of the the infrastructure could you know be pushed so i think what i think the first step may probably be i can check back in the office but uh i know rob phillips the city engineer sent an email out about i think this meeting and just kind of getting an update from this and what we learned here at this meeting so i think there had been questions at least from the city as is this just a parking issue or is this bigger and it sounds like the push is for something bigger so i'll check to see if if the proper first step would be a transportation commission meeting where we try to get input from more people about what to do whether because i can just tell you like uh dempsey road for example is an unimproved street that's going to a street with curb and gutter and and the meetings just for that alone for a short stretch of dempsey road a couple blocks um it's it's multiple meetings it's a multi-year process a lot of times because it's so hard for to come to a final plan for the street because um there's there's so much so many different so many different people pulling in different ways and asking for different things and the residents want one thing people that use the street to get you know just as a through street wants something else and so i'm i'm i just want to make it clear that even if the city decided like right now okay we're going to move forward with the reconstruction project it's not going to be reconstructed this year it's not going to be reconstructed next year it's probably going to be a couple years down the line so that's kind of what this what this meeting was for is to get us between now and then what is there something that can be done like next week because we can put signs in now so that's kind of what this meeting was if it's just dead set that you know residents are pushing for a reconstruction project i think that's going to be something that's going to have to be discussed at least yeah at the transportation transportation commission meeting because it doesn't really meet the things that city engineering usually requires for a reconstruction project in that it's not really falling apart there aren't like water main breaks or or sanitary sewer leaks or sinkholes or something like that and there's not um and they're just there haven't been high high injury crashes in the area so also i just wanted to make a little correction from before this part of knutson is not a bus route yes the bus there are buses occasionally that go through from um when school is in session school buses occasionally but otherwise the city bus goes through the cwc property up to knutson at the cwc entrance and then goes out east from there we never have city buses coming down our section of knutson ever that's probably never because i sit on my cup well they don't go down they don't come down they go up they go up no they don't go either way i mean we live right there i see what's going on all the time there are no city buses that go on this stretch of knutson there simply aren't there are sometimes school buses and there are city buses though there are city buses that pick up the kids to take them to school well our kids used to get on those buses to go it's i have not seen that for a really really long time i don't know what the city is doing about um busing children with the pandemic situation but it's not a regular city bus route that's all i wanted to say thanks for uh kind of outlining the process it's surprising that we haven't gotten part of the way down this i mean this has been a topic for a long time i know rebecca kembel was uh very aware of it uh she led uh folks here to believe that that that that it was going to be worked on i think that's one of the reasons she's not in office anymore because a lot of folks felt deceived of that nothing happened on this i hopefully it's not as controversial as you talk about as far as the the city engineers i mean like i say we're not asking for anything special just the upper canoes and to look the same dimensions as lower lower canoes and uh charles this is where we really kind of need to help us out get this process moving uh it's really disappointing that we're talking two year life two year five year uh time span we're hoping to get this going through the planning and then you know at least so we could get some shoveling ground by next summer uh any preliminaries done this summer that we could uh i'd like to mention that um i really feel like charles that this is not necessarily the best solution and even though larry is talking about this as if it's basically a done deal and needs to be done i'm not sure that that's really the case we have tom saying that this stretch of canoes and does not present the data that would normally indicate that this street needs to be widened or other things need to be done in terms of what is the best solution i don't think that we have a definite decision on that i think there's still a lot of room for discussion that's where we're willing to to get i mean if a survey if a petition is necessary we're willing to get a couple hundred people that will say yeah it should be improved well that's that's fine what i'm saying is that we need to have additional perspectives involved here uh one which getting back to the uh the runoff issue uh is something that should be at least considered instead of just automatically doing what we've always done because that's what we've always done i'd like to consider what the other options are before we make a final decision a final decision and i i don't like the idea of considering this to be a done deal already well that's fine but the process is is how do we get city engineering and streets department to actually start looking at this and coming up with solutions and maybe it's not curb and gutter maybe it's widen the street maybe there's other some runoff issues that they can incorporate but the fact is is that it needs to be improved and widened so that people can use it safely so um like i said i've been i've been arguing i've been arguing this since 1989 i've been talking to people about this and going nowhere we even with the backing of the whole neighborhood association we weren't getting anywhere and maybe it hasn't gone anywhere because it hasn't needed to go anywhere so with that perspective then i guess that this road will never be done unless there's sinkholes and potholes that come into it it'll never be addressed and then it'll only be put back towards as right now and so i don't think that's an acceptable that's an extreme view of what the alternative is there is no comparable rule with that amount of traffic that is the main thoroughfare into a neighborhood in the city that compares to this one and there don't seem to be accidents or other problems at this point i think it is a good idea to do a traffic count now that the construction at cwc and particularly at mmhi is done we we've got a lot less traffic we don't have the big dump trucks dump trucks coming through all the time the huge semis coming down knutson a lot of that traffic has stopped because there is no longer the major commercial you know well state construction so i think this probably would be a good time to to do a new traffic count uh jim has his hand up do you want to say something jim um you're muted jim you're muted okay can you hear me now yeah i think i think i just have a couple comments the verticality of the road the steep pitch makes it really difficult to collect stormwater and i'm wondering tom if you could tell us what is the route of stormwater passage for example down on troy and knutson intersection because all that water flows downhill i i just can't see easily any catch ponds nearby and i'm wondering if there is foliage to the two basins um by the uh park close to lake mendota where runoff occurs from part of the north madison neighborhood yeah i'm not sure right off hand i would have to look at like a contour map i don't have that there is a retention pond at the bottom of knutson take a look at knutson right where it makes a left hand turn going up to the cul-de-sac there is a city built retention pond of that collects all the stormwater from this from this neighborhood okay good that's what that's what i thought it was one of the two locales i had thought but you know once again having a localized catch basin with such a steep pitched road is really going to be difficult because that catch basin would have to be nearby yeah so that that's a that's a major challenge which is why there were individual swales for each house and that's where the stormwater runoff would go that's a problem still with the pitch of the road ma'am yeah you know hey i i mean if if we want to do something uh novel with rainwater runoff that's fine put it into a different uh different duct system that goes into a different directions i certainly uh don't want to interfere with that of it you know that rerouting that little section of knutson is not going to make a big impact on the lake everything goes into a retention pond which sits before it goes out into the marsh uh and that's fine if we want to do something with that but i don't want that to interfere with the basic project of widening the road well as tom said that we are really trying to focus on what we can do right now and widening the road is a separate issue which really should involve more people than what we've got here tonight so um i'd really like to get back to the the parking issue and what the recommendations are for that i personally think there should be no parking on the street on the pavement at all because the road is just a barely a two-lane road as it is so anything parked on the road essentially brings it down to a one-lane road i thought most people on that street do not want um no parking i got a few emails about um may were you one of them that didn't want any no parking signs on that street or um no no and i didn't email you about that um i i as i said a little earlier i'd be fine with parking on one side of the street i would rather not have people parking off the pavement because i think that in practical terms it sounds great but in practical terms i don't think that is going to be workable at all times of the year and i would be a little concerned about my my property being torn up yeah man you're right across from that business aren't you not from a business i mean there's uh not directly yeah there's we're across from pam and jone who uh are uh and jone has a business an acupuncture business which is part-time it's not is there's cars there frequently yes there are there's often cars there so what you're saying is you don't want i know what you're saying is you don't want maybe not so much during the pandemic so what's going to happen meg is that if we don't have parking they're going to the her clientele are may park in your yard well uh like i said i i'm not opposed to restricting parking to one side of the street i'm fine with that if if you think that that is going to be the you know if everyone thinks that's going to be the best solution i would rather not have um restriction of all parking on the street i'm trying to figure out which side of the street would with the parking be on because with the hill it's a hazard no matter which side of the street the parking is on either someone coming down is going to be coming at me and my lane or else i'm going to be heading at them going around the car park on my side right either way somebody coming up the hill is going to have to swerve into the center yeah um never had any swerving going on uh like i said i have never seen that to be a problem in my own experience neither is my husband i haven't heard any neighbors mention it either so tom the postcard and also my blog um did it just say something about parking or did it talk about widening the street as well as well as as far as uh the agenda i'm a little bit um the postcard said this was about parking and um it did preface that with saying that there were no plans to widen or otherwise make changes to knutson and so we were going to discuss the parking issue i think the reason a lot of the the reason that my emails to the city have been of pictures when i stopped my car when i was going up because somebody was coming down at me is pointing out the parking as being a problem of the street width it's not so much that you know what i'm saying it's like how else do you you know it's not the root cause parking is not the root cause the root causes it's too just narrow well the the situation we have right now is that the street is not going to be widened at least for some time so we have to do whatever is best to make things better today well my my suggestion would be that there should be no parking once you get past your house where the the curvature gets really steep on either side you know there's a few houses like some green up maybe two houses where it's rather flat where you could park on one side or the other and not cause a horrible um traffic mishap but once you get up another house and you can't see over that hill then parking on either side is very hazardous yeah i don't know i just i just don't see it i i mean i travel it all the time and and i just i don't know what you're talking about where it's flatter i mean right right down near green it is a little flatter but the the hill goes pretty much evenly up right up to the cwc entrance yes it does except that there at least there's some you can see once someone's coming down cresting the hill you get you have a chance to see them if there's if someone's parking on either side once you get closer to that you do not you cannot see what's coming at you right when you get by mary pelter's house there on the just right before she does see driveway if someone's coming down the hill real fast in the middle of the lane which is so fast but they're always coming down the middle right always coming down right and so that's where you get it is right about there or a little bit further down towards green a little bit so that's where you're cresting the hill yeah i just i just haven't experienced it so i'm not sure you know that you man you're the only person i know that hasn't that doesn't know what we're talking about here charles you wrote that my husband doesn't either you wrote that charles you wrote on that road today uh do you know what we're talking about as far as a limited sight distance and the uh the danger of swerving uh to the left when you're approaching that hill and the limited sight distance you know what we're talking about yeah i know exactly what you're talking about i've seen pictures and i've rode on that road a few times so i think it's important is that to push this toward uh transportation and talk about it and uh definitely get something done about it um and also like meg said um i don't want a lot of voices that drawn out you know meg's voice you know but it's important that people understand that you know every voice must be heard so i think it's important to actually get more um send out more postcards to everybody but i'm going to see if we can transfer this to transportation committee commission in order to discuss it further if you want a solution i guess i don't have a problem if you want to put up no parking on one side of the street as long as we keep this discussion about widening the street and improvements to the street keep going and so if it's a temporary issue of parking on one side fine i i don't agree with that parking on one side if it's on the pavement is making it a one-lane road that there's 4 000 cars according to your last count going up and down that road it can't be a one-lane road um i would i would like to see more data from the transportation department on um the steepness of the hill and the the change in elevation i'm sure there as as a traffic engineer i'm sure things like that must be addressed in terms of sight lines and right how much rise you have over a certain amount of of length so i'd like to have a little more data on what is considered you know a safe amount of of incline over this particular stretch of road and i'd also like to see more specifics about the number of cars coming through and if there are any other data points so that we can make a so that we can make decisions based on data instead of opinions i i haven't seen certain particular problems other people have seen problems but those are anecdotal instances for all of us what i'd really like to see is data and i was gonna mention and i think those are pretty easy calculations that we can do we can look at the sight distance for vertical hills like that so i think i even though we're obviously not going to agree on anything in this meeting i think this meeting is helpful now that we more understand what people are looking for so i think the way moving forward as we collect that data and take this to the transportation commission kind of have the same discussion have a larger mailing let people know that this is going to be discussed so and just for your information at those meetings members of the public are given three minutes to speak so it is you know worth the three minutes to go to the meeting and and have your opinion heard so i don't know when that meeting would be there's a meeting this week and then they meet every other week so at the earliest it would be two weeks from wednesday but uh you know that also depends on us collecting data we've got to get the data collected before then but we'll also take this what we learned here at this meeting back to engineering so they can have their input on it because they're really the ones that you know go through the budget and and move the projects around from year to year to make things work so they're looking like five years out so but uh i think regardless of no matter what we do you know we're not going to be able to come up with a an agreement tonight to remove parking from one side it sounds like so that is all all of those options can be discussed at transportation commission and they should be anyway so i think that's probably how we move forward on this and then yeah there would be a larger mailing and let everyone know this is what we're talking about i would say we're talking about everything we're not just talking about removing parking we're talking about a possible reconstruction project or the possibility of that so just so people don't you know dismiss the meeting yeah i apologize that's not a lot of people at this meeting but i did send it out to uh over 200 i believe people that are on canooton drive you always want to send from my i just came on so you gotta understand that uh from what i was told is send postcards to everybody on that street so but there's not there's not many people on i mean canootson drive is only three blocks long so i know we live on green i don't believe we got a postcard so if you sent it to people on canootson i don't think there was more than 30 houses yeah part of our part of our point with this whole thing is that canootson drive serves about 230 different households here it's not just the folks on canootson uh you know it's this entire neighborhood this is the main route in and out of our neighborhood so impacts a ton more people than just the folks on canootson exactly so send it to a lot more okay so yeah and one of the gentlemen on this call right now i think you said you live on beat i mean that's not even in this neighborhood so i mean this is in the neighborhood it's a block away no i understand that but i mean i just mean when you send out the this next notice it needs to go out past the border lines of westport meadows and metal ridge it means there's other sections of this neighborhood essentially essentially everybody in my neighborhood that goes to northport drive uses the connector to go up canootson yeah i was just afraid that that neighborhood wouldn't be informed is all my point was the neighborhood wasn't i'm on charles's blog list okay okay i'll make sure that everybody is informed everybody can show up and give their input and and uh i know that this is something major i didn't realize that this was such a we're working on the corridor on on veracourt but i didn't realize that people are actually using that as a corridor to get through and so that it's a major major problem right there i just got done with where the road or how people are using that as a corridor to cut through and we had to solve that issue so this is a big issue that definitely got to be solved so a lot of the emails i saw were people parked on the side of the street where people couldn't get through so i was really concerned about that but uh there's other issues involved here so definitely to have everybody's input is important so me and tom will gather the data and get back with engineering and set up another meeting but i think the meeting will be at traffic and i'll let everybody know of when that meeting is going to be taking place Tom anything else? All right yeah that sounds like a plan i i would assume that's the way we go but uh yeah we'll check with engineering first just to make sure that there's not something that they can say flat out i i just saw some of the emails from engineering where it it sounded like uh yeah they just wanted some more information too so well uh i would think that the transportation commission is probably the next step but uh yeah just alder meadsy will will keep you informed on that yeah i said but we'll get we'll get going on the collecting the data right away so yeah i sit on the transportation i asked the mayor to put me on this because uh one of the biggest issues was transportation in this district so i'll be definitely letting everybody know about uh any upcoming uh meetings as such excuse me i'm carol stromiska and i'm on green avenue i have a question go ahead if this is going to become a real long drawn out something um reconstruction or planning meetings and on and on what are the chances of just getting the road less bumpy i mean is there anything they do in the meantime to make it a more passable road yeah actually it was resurfaced a couple of years ago with a substantial amount of asphalt the tar and and pea gravel is not resurfacing that it's not resurfacing that it's not resurfacing that it's not resurfacing that it's not resurfacing that it's not resurfacing that it's not resurfacing that it's not resurfacing that no it was actually a surface it was actual asphalt that was put down it wasn't it wasn't just seal coating or something like that they put down a layer i i would have to see that because like i said i live right there i did i watched it as they put it down and i didn't think it was anything more than just a black coating because yeah it wasn't just a blast it wasn't just a coating this was a layer of asphalt and i was told that the reason that they did this is because they knew the city knew that they were not going to put um you know we're not going to reconstruct it right away and they needed to do something that would make it last a bit longer and because the infrastructure underneath was not that old um it was lowered down on their priority list for a complete reconstruction so that was a you know an interim measure and it is a lot better i mean it's a whole lot better than it was before they put that asphalt down and it's it has stayed that way for the last couple years so that's something that we're going to be discussing feel like it's just a bumpy mess yeah i agree with you carol it's it's a lot better than it was i've been here 29 years and it just doesn't seem any better to me okay well i'm sure that tom can tell us uh what the city actually did do on the road a couple of years ago and we can address that too at the meeting too yeah okay i'd like to see that addressed just yeah what is your term solution if we can't come to a long-term solution so the city engineer is also uh yeah they've got all information on this they they rate the pavement and they rate the curb and gutter of all the streets so they've got they've got the whole ranking of that so they they keep an eye on that stuff okay thank you kind of interesting that our street was green avenue was put in like in 1987 and in 2003 they totally tore it up and redid it curved better and everything so it doesn't last as long as you might think it does okay tom and charles thanks appreciate it um from my end here i you know i think we're kind of getting to a conclusion that nothing's going to happen today that you're going to send out meeting information but let everybody know and what the next steps are if city engineering has more data i'm sure you're going to get back to us with some kind of notification says hey there's a definite no or this is you know what they're planning or if it's going to go to a meeting that we understand it yep exactly so just look for those updates and we'll uh we'll start collecting the data right now and we'll yeah move forward from there so thanks very good thanks for everybody's participation thank you thank you
