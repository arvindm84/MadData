============================================================

 Hello, how's it going? I'm doing well. Doing thank, doing well. Good. I got this, the recording started and I'm looking for how to disable the chat, trying to figure out how to do that. There's a way to do that and I'm not quite sure how. Okay. Oh shoot, I don't know either. Is this through the council office neighborhood meetings? No, this is just through my own Zoom account. Okay. Through my council's Zoom account. So I'll have to figure that out because I want to disable it, it's so distracting. Yeah. Can I have the option to share screen at some point? Sure. I think I got the video queued up at just the right point. I'm hoping that works well. Oh, I've got it. I figured it out now. Okay. Try to chat and see what happens. Yep. Okay. Let's see. No, it's disabled. So that's... Okay. All right. I'll let you screen share. Okay. Can I just practice it to make sure it's going to work, the video? Because you wanted a post mayor intro. Yeah. It says share multiple. So you should be able to do so now. This should do it. Let's see. Let's hear sound. Okay. Yeah, this is going to work just fine. I'm going to... Hello, and thank you for your time. Yes. Okay. All right. Very good. Yep. That works. All right. Well, we'll wait until people get in. Okay. Sounds good. Do you want to... Thank you. I just got those slides done. If you want to check... If you want me to share them with you really quickly here, I'm happy to. Oh, sorry. But... Okay. No, it's... I'll just start letting people in when they arrive. I started the meeting up early just to... Okay. I'm going to start the meeting. Okay. I'll see you in a bit. Yeah. Thanks so much for doing this. Oh, yeah. No problem. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Hey everybody, I'm just letting folks in and it's now 730 but let's wait a few more minutes as people are coming in. You you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you I do. It's Heather. Thank you. Yeah, thank you, Mark. All right. Well, thank you all very much, and I will see. Just a second here. I'm out of the video. Okay. Okay. So we took a look today and tried to pull together some District 13 specific information that I thought, you know, some of it pertains to the questions that I saw in advance and I'm hoping it can help to address some of those upfront. This is an interactive zoning map of the entire city but this shows District 13 here outlined in green. And this this same map which any of you can access and explore actually has a tab on it that will show all of the zoning districts that are impacted by the proposed changes. So those are ringed in purple here and you can see within District 13 there are a lot of different areas. I'm going to walk through the different neighborhoods and just show you a examples of each of these areas. The map also has a feature that allows you to put in the neighborhood association. So for those of you that think geographically by neighborhood association you can see here, Dugan Monroe, Vilas, we have Greenbush, Menona Bay, and Bay Creek. So all of the neighborhood associations within District 13 as well. So you can see things geographically that way. Marching around District 13 I'm going to start just here on the southern end of Dugan Monroe. And so this is Monroe Street. Here's Winger Park, just for reference, and the zoning districts that are surrounded by the purple line here are those that are impacted by the changes and we'll go through some example properties of each relevant zoning district here in just a minute. Moving to the northern end of Dugan Monroe here, you can see this is Monroe Street. And also Vilas and Greenbush neighborhoods we have a lot right along Regent Street. There's a large traditional residential Buried One District just south of Regent Street here in the Greenbush neighborhood. And then this is South Park Street on this eastern edge of the Greenbush neighborhood has a lot of property that's in the traditional shopping street or TSS district. Heading a little further east to the Menona Bay neighborhood association. This is the Bayview property just for reference, and this is zoned traditional residential urban one TRU one. So that property and then again, the traditional shopping street property right along South Park Street here. Then moving south into the Bay Creek neighborhood. There's a little bit wider variety of districts that are relevant for these changes. This is the Romness Apartments just for reference, right in the middle of Bay Creek, and that's zoned suburban residential Buried Two. This is a small collection of commercial buildings along Lakeside zoned neighborhood mixed use. And then the Wingra Triangle here and again just for reference, this is the Peloton project here on the northern edge of that of that Wingra Triangle. And there's a lot of property near the new SSM near the new Truman Olsen development that's in the commercial quarter transitional or CCT district right along here. And then there's also a separate, a separate element of this ordinance change that would do one simple thing, and that has to do with the TRC for and TRB one districts. When you have property in these districts today. If you have a sufficient amount of property, the districts allow for single family to family and three family buildings and TRB one actually allows for up to four unit buildings. However, if you have a single family home today and wish to convert it to a two unit or a two to a three or a three to a four. You can only do that as a permitted use if you don't have another property of a similar, similar type property within 300 feet. And so, what one thing these zoning changes do is it gets rid of that 300 foot requirement and allows for things to occur by right more predictably on that very, very small scale, the single, the two, three and four unit buildings. I want to go through some some specific property examples, and I want to take a little bit of time with these and I can always go back to them if there are relevant questions that come up. So this is one example of TRC for zoning right along Jefferson Street. I want to stress that all of these slides. Please don't consider the properties, you know, redevelopment opportunities or that there's no reason for picking any specific property, other than I wanted to try to get a good variety and a good geographic distribution within the district 13. And so when you see a certain property here please don't don't consider it as a redevelopment site. I want to stress that especially because you know this home certainly doesn't seem like a redevelopment site to me as many of them, as you'll notice. At any rate, in the TRC for district, single two and three family dwellings are allowable so long as you have a sufficient amount of lot area, and the lot areas really how much square footage do you have on your property. Today this lot is a 7200 square foot lot. There's a single family home on it today. And the table down here shows what would be allowable today in this first row. And then, under the proposed changes, what would be allowable. If the proposed changes are passed. So there's a single family home today. The property owner could propose to construct or add to this existing building, a second and even a third unit. But if it was within 300 feet of another two or three unit building, they would need a conditional use. And so what the change does here is it simply eliminates that need to get a conditional use. If you happen to have someone within 300 feet of your property that already has a two or three unit building. So again, the only change here is that the two or three unit building, or the addition of another unit or two units to this existing home would be allowable by right. So here's another example in this same zoning district, right right on South Brittingham place in the Manona Bay neighborhood association area. This is another single family home it's right next to a two unit building. And today, if this property owner wished to add another unit to their home, they would need a conditional use from the city's plan commission, since there's a property within 300 feet of them already a two unit building. Under the proposed changes, they could go ahead and construct that two unit building meeting all of the other zoning requirements, but they could do that by right without a conditional use approval by the city's plan commission. Moving on to the other zoning districts. This is the only example in district 13 of the suburban residential very to district. And again, it's the Romney's apartments. Today there are 168 units. And what the proposal would do to the SRV to district is allow for slightly greater density, if, if any site is to be redeveloped, or if additions of new units are proposed. And again, these tables and I can send these to elder Evers for reference so that you'd have them, but currently allowable on this very large property today it's almost an eight acre site property owner which is the CDA could theoretically propose a series of eight unit buildings on 16,000 square foot lots that would require a subdivision of the property, and is frankly unlikely, unlikely to happen. Under the proposed changes, moving up moving into the future, the property owner could propose a series of 24 unit residential buildings on 36,000 square foot lots those are each almost an acre in size, no changes to the height. And again, it's a proposal that that that threshold for the permitted use would change from a maximum of eight units today to 24 units as proposed. And if you think about maximizing the use of this property. The proposed changes would allow in the future for up to 225 total units on this almost eight acre site, rather than the 168 that are there today. And that would definitely require conditional use review by the city's plan commission. So this is a very small scale site on high street this is the traditional residential varied one district, where the only land use is allowable are single family homes, two unit three unit and four unit buildings with regard to what's allowed on these properties, nothing is changing as as proposed. I think the star is in the wrong spot supposed to be right here. Sorry about that I'll change that before I send it to elder Evers. So what's currently allowable on this site today as a permitted use is a single family home, a two to three unit building could be constructed, but it would need a conditional use if it was in within 300 feet of another two or three unit building. As proposed, the changes would slightly increase the allowable density for a site like this in a 7000 square foot lot could accommodate a four unit building and so in theory, the owner of this property could look to add a fourth unit to this existing three unit building at some point in the future if these changes were were to be approved. So I think the traditional residential varied to district or TRB to district. I think the best example of that is is right along Monroe Street here. There's a stretch of multifamily buildings fairly small, ranging from two unit to, I think, six unit buildings This particular building is at 2801 Monroe Street. It's a 9600 square foot lot has six buildings today, sorry six units six housing units in it. And this is interesting because it actually has more housing units than are than the zoning code currently allows today. And so it's what we would call a non conforming use it's overbuilt for what our current zoning allows today what would actually be allowed on this site, and And that's, that's not uncommon, I will say on on near center city properties that were built long before the current zoning code was constructed. And so what's what's actually allowable on this property as a permitted use today as a four unit building three stories maximum or in theory, one could separate this lot into two and do two two unit buildings. Under these zoning proposals, the density allowable on the site would increase slightly so that the six unit building that's there today would be a permitted use again three stories maximum no change to the height. But one could construct a six unit building on the site, similar to the one that's there today, or in theory, again, two separate three unit buildings on separate lots. So the zoning change really doesn't impact this property much at all, but it, it does create a conforming use you know it doesn't allow any additional development, but it brings it into conformity. This is a vacant lot. I wanted to show a good variety of properties. This is the traditional residential urban one district right along proud fit again here's Bayview just for reference. This site is a vacant lot that's over a half an acre in size, and what would currently be allowable under today's code on this site would be a series of three eight unit buildings on separate lots, and that would require a subdivision of the property. The buildings could be three units maximum. And if a developer were to pursue a conditional use approval, they could construct up to a 25 unit building on the site today. Now as as the zoning proposals pertain to this particular property. A developer could construct a 24 unit residential building at four stories by right. And this just so happens to be well within the range of what would be supported by the city's recently adopted plans for this area. Another option could be to split the site in half and construct a total of 34 units and two buildings and so you might do to 17 unit buildings or 10 unit and a 24 unit. The catch here is that anything over 24 units in this district would need a conditional use approval still even under the proposed changes. And to really max out the site, you're looking at a total of 34 units in this particular zoning district. Now moving on to the mixed use districts and we've shared a lot of examples and past presentations to the plan commission and council so you can find others that are scattered throughout the city, but I wanted to focus on a few here. I think the first one that I think Evers had had brought to my mind, especially this first one here this is right along lakeside. And it's actually a stretch of, you know, well loved single and two story commercial buildings. And just in order to show what could theoretically be done here. We've, you know, we've done the same analysis as all of the others I've shown so far. Each of you can think through, you know, briefly think through the economics of what is allowable as well. And, you know, would it ever truly make sense for someone to purchase this property for market value, demolish it and construct something new I think the answer to that for this particular property is probably no, I think that there's so much embodied, you know, value in that building today but in theory, you know what we have on this 6200 square foot lot. What's currently allowable today is someone could construct a four unit residential building three stories maximum, or they could construct a mixed use building, a small mixed use building with up to eight housing units at three stories, that would be allowable today. And under the proposed changes as a permitted use, one could construct a 12 unit building. Again three stories maximum no change to the height, or a mixed use building with up to 24 units and three stories, three stories maximum. Now as a conditional use so if one were to request an approval by the city's plan commission which is usually granted. Today, one could one could construct a six unit building with no height limit, or a mixed use building with no unit or height limits and so this is when the plan commission would take a look at adopted plans and determine whether the proposed height and number of units is something that could be supported as a conditional use. And there really isn't a change at all being proposed to what could be proposed as a as a conditional use in the future. An important thing you'll notice in all of these mixed use districts is that today, the zoning code does not have an absolute height limit. Any height can be sought as a conditional use. And there's also for mixed use buildings. There aren't any limits on the number of units. And so that that's something that is the case today with the zoning code and wouldn't be changing in the future. So this is one of the best examples of the neighborhood mixed use district there are certainly other areas within district 13 in that nmx district. But I want to move now to the traditional shopping street district. This is a site obviously owned by the city. It's a public parking lot in the city's Monroe Street Library. So again, just in theory, looking at what this lot could accommodate as a as a redevelopment in the future. It's an 11,000 square foot lot. And today, what's currently allowable is a mixed use building with 24 units and up to three stories. However, as a as a conditional use, if a property owner would go to the plan commission for approval, they could propose up to a 22 unit residential building or a mixed use building with no unit or height limits. Now under the proposed changes, what could happen here by right would be a 24 unit residential building three stories maximum, or a mixed use building with 48 units maximum. And, and again, a three stories no change to the height. If one wanted to pursue the maximum number of units in a residential only building, they could they could pursue approvals by the plan commission for a 31 unit building under the proposed changes, or again, a mixed use building with no unit or height limits. Just a few more here that I want to show. This was one that was shown to the plan commission or council before this again is a well loved site along South Park Street but is an important example to show some of the nuances in the code that will protect adjacent neighborhoods from tall buildings and I want to talk just a little bit about that. So this is a site that's, you know, almost 17,000 square feet in size, and it's zoned commercial corridor transitional or CCT. So what's currently allowable on this site today is a mixed use building with a maximum of 24 dwelling units at a maximum of five stories. And what I want to what I want to stress is that in actuality, no one would ever construct a five story building on this site because one of the requirements in the code requires a 45 degree step down to the residential properties immediately to the to the east here along Cedar Street. And so for those upper levels floors three, four, and five. Again, there would need to be a 45 degree step back to really preserve some of the solar access to those properties behind it to the east. And so I think what we'd really see is probably a maximum of a two story building with a with a partial third story on this site, just, just from the way that the zoning code works. But in all the commercial quarter transitional or CCT district does allow for five unit buildings by right today and would continue to under these changes. As proposed, in theory, again, one could try to propose a 32 unit residential building at five stories max again there's there's the built in limitation with that 45 degrees step back that's going to really limit that height on this property. And then another use that would be permitted would be a mixed use building with 60 units maximum and that's not a reality to construct on a site of this size with the 45 degree height limit. So let's go to another CCT site on the other side of Park Street. So this is this is the site of Park Street where we directly abut low density residential housing and the code has the height transition built in, like I just described on the other side of This is a city owned vacant site 1202 South Park Street. It's about the same size as that cargo coffee site. Again vacant today. Since it's not abutting residentially zoned properties, the height transition doesn't apply and so one could actually construct a five story building on this site under the zoning code today. So today, a mixed use building with 24 units and five stories could be built by right, but if you do a conditional use approval, there's no unit or height limit for mixed use buildings. The limit for residential buildings would be 22 units for the purely residential building. And again, as proposed, that number of residential units and a purely residential building increases to about 30 again still five stories maximum no change to the height. And for a mixed use building in theory 60 unit building with with five story maximum could be could be constructed on the site. So that is a quick look at examples relevant to district 13 and tried to cover examples and in all or most of the neighborhood associations. Just before I wrap up here wanted to to mention again for those of you who have been following this process. This was introduced at the Common Council meeting in early February, reviewed by the Housing Strategy Committee in late February, and the plan Commission in late March, and the Common Council on March 30 referred it to the May 18 meeting of the Common Council so that's when we expect it back at Common Council again. And at this point I can stop sharing and turn it back over to Mark. Thank you, Heather. So from that standpoint, that actually is a pretty good lead into our first question. In that it was talking about, I will share my screen again. It, the question was talking about what are the specific impacts of the proposed up zoning to district 13 so I think you did a good job of trying to cover all of that. So, from that standpoint, is there anything else you want to say to address that first question around impact of the proposal of the proposal. Yeah, I think, I think I've shown you know often you can see it best on a map that it's, you know, it's throughout district 13 and small areas and really it's throughout the city so I want to, I want to stress that this is not a proposal that only pertains to the center of the city, anything you'd want to say to directly answer the question I have kind of a just a clarification based on what I saw you show. Yeah, I think, you know, the proposed changes are different by zoning district and so again we have our, our lower density multifamily residential districts the TRB one TRB to SRV one SRV to those differ from the other. And I think the best, you know, the best way to go through it is probably to read was a staff memorandum on legislature that has two pages devoted to a table that really goes through for each zoning district. What are the changes, what are the changes from today to proposed and walks through those bullet by bullet to give folks a good sense of what would be changing by zoning district. But again, as a whole, we're looking at two different families of changes one is slight increases to the allowable densities 30 to 40% increase. And the second is to change that threshold between what's what's a permitted by right use and what requires conditional use review by the city's plan commission, so that the smaller scale multifamily residential projects can move forward more predictably, and, and with that permitted use. So those are the those are the two types of changes. And again those those thresholds differ by by zoning district. And I think that the question I thought applied here is, Peter had previously asked before we started your presentation to to say how does that affect my house and I think the question most people probably have in their mind is for the traditional residential zoning areas. Can you highlight the changes that are most likely to be seen there. Sure. Um, you see here, what would be most helpful. Actually mark if it's okay I'll bring up the the map again that basically shows the distribution of these districts. Oh, and I thought I was sharing my screen it didn't quite take so that's fine. Okay, let's see so in in the southern part of Dugan Monroe. You know this area here is zone traditional residential varied one. Again, the change is very slight in this district, it basically depending on your lot size, you may have an opportunity to add an additional dwelling unit. But still the maximum number of dwelling units allowed in TRB one is four. And so, you know, you might have a single family two family three family or four family home anywhere along this stretch, and instead of meeting, and I'm going to, I'll say this a couple times but instead So in other words, if you have a 6,000 square foot lot today which is maybe a fairly standard lot size 6000 square foot property. So in this district, if you had a 6,000 square foot lot, you could do up to a three unit building. Now with the proposed change that same 6000 square foot lot could support up to four units. Which is usually quite small. It's a maybe the addition of one additional unit to what would be allowable today and and often no change at all. So that's that's the TRB one district and if you kind of march around the area here. This is a TRB one area right up by Regent Street in the Greenbush neighborhood. Let's see. In the Bayview neighborhood here, the TRB one areas are right down here and then up on Haywood and High Street up in this area. So that's the same deal very, very small, small change and that same density change applies to the TRB two district, you can have larger residential buildings in that district, but they're at the same exact density as TRB one meaning that, you know, in order to construct an eight unit building in the TRB two district today you would need a 16,000 square foot lot, but under the proposed changes, you would only need a 12,000 square foot lot and under in order to construct an eight unit building. So that's the magnitude of the changes in those districts, those, you know, lower, lower density residential districts. All right, thank you. So then I'll share my screen again and we'll go through the question. So thank you for that. There. All right. So we answered the first couple questions, parts of this first question. The last one is, what might be some of the unintended consequences of this proposal? I think a, you know, a lot of this depends on the economics of a certain property. I think in Madison we have a very different situation with our land economics than certainly Milwaukee and a lot of other cities where land and improvements are already fairly expensive. And so I think I have heard some concerns about this, again, this slight increase in allowable density, maybe putting some properties over the edge to make them attractive for redevelopment. You know, I think that in some cases that could occur, but it's really important to look at the magnitude of the changes being proposed. You know, our zoning code today allows a lot. And, you know, we still don't see widespread demolition of small scale housing across the city. And I think that the fact that these changes are so modest is going to really limit the unintended consequences as we move forward. But again, one of the unintended consequences that we believe at least heard a lot of concern about is the likelihood of some of these changes leading to the demolition of very small scale, naturally affordable housing that's perhaps been around since the 70s, let's say. And wasn't developed at the level of intensity that the zoning code allows. So perhaps a demolition of a three or four unit old building that hasn't had a lot of investment in order to construct, you know, a seven or eight unit building or whatever the lot would allow after the proposal. And so I think that that is one of the unintended consequences that we're trying to avoid. And I think that's one of the reasons why you see that these changes are so modest as proposed. They're right in line with the, you know, the proposed density ranges in the city's comprehensive plan and really pertain mostly to the small scale multifamily residential. And so you won't see any change to the process for larger scale residential projects or mixed use projects really focused on providing more predictability for small scale developers, entry level developers to get that small scale residential that we haven't seen much of over the past decade. All right, thank you. So I'm going to move on to the next question. So Pardon me for a minute. There we go. When will the city resolve the still unresolved issues about up zoning, such as demolition permits and stormwater permits. I think we, you know, we, the three of us here actually have been working with the plan commission to think about changes to the city's demolition ordinance. We've been working with the plan commission chair and would expect to get those back to plan commission for consideration, probably within the next several months. Next next three months or so. I'm not sure what the question is about the stormwater permits and that's a little bit out of our purview, but I believe that, you know, city engineering that the city has recently adopted massive changes to the stormwater regulations. And so I'll turn to my colleagues, Matt and John to see if they are aware of any other changes coming with regard to stormwater permitting. I'm not aware of any other changes coming in those stormwater permits and the requirements apply across the city. Those are not necessarily imposed through the zoning code. They have a whole separate chapter in the ordinances that that imposes stormwater requirements. I'm not aware of any changes to the stormwater permitting either, although I have been part of some conversations with city engineering about being more intelligent with what we call lot coverage on our properties. That's basically amount of pervious or impervious ratio between the two on the properties and there's been some interest to make our zoning code maybe more intelligent about about areas that are pervious to be more in line with the stormwater regulations for the ability for water to I think that those are kind of normal and ongoing incidents we kind of do when different parts of the ordinances are changing and there's new efforts moving forward. Okay, thank you. And then, what were the reasons that led the council to postpone voting on the zoning code changes? This is probably at the individual level. I don't know but a couple of things that I recall hearing that evening of March 30th and many of you can go back and watch it as well but I think that there were a few elders at least who are no longer all there's today, who wanted to make sure that their successors had an opportunity to get to understand the zoning code and be the ones voting on this proposal. And another specific thing that was requested from just one older was that a new racial equity and social justice analysis be done on these zoning ordinance changes specifically. While while the council realized that racial equity and social justice analysis had led to the recommendations to do this in our city's Conference of Plan and other housing reports. They wanted another new, you know, 2021 racial equity and social justice analysis to be done on this on this package. All right, thank you. So the third question is the proposed zoning ordinances will allow for permitted development with no neighborhood associate NA notification required by the plan commission. What process will the city implement to notify neighborhoods. What will the developers be required to meet with it, or will the developers be required to meet with the neighborhood, and will adjacent neighborhoods be notified of development that will affect them as well. Matt, do you want to take this one and talk a little bit about notification. Sure, I can try so one of the, one of the enhancements that we've been working on since about the, about January of this year has been a ability to utilize the Our elders as conduits to the neighborhood associations for notification of any and all projects that come through the city's site plan review process and that is, we have projects that are in various stages of development, sometimes they go to boards committees or Other times they're simply permitted uses and they, they submit plans those plans are reviewed by city agencies and once the site plan review process is completed they can secure building permits and begin construction, black roads, and one of the enhancements that were were already to cut loose is a email notification process to the Alders, Alders have city email addresses, and it will notify them of the status of projects kind of a basic what is the project, and a couple of different points. One point is when projects are submitted for review. That's when they're entered into our system and agencies begin their reviews. Typically, the processes, maybe we can have two weeks on the short end, and it can be months on the longer and depending on the complexity of the project. So be the front end of that. And then the other notification is once the project has completed the site plan review process. And it just notes that it's been completed, meaning that that it's likely that you're going to see vehicles starting to assemble and project construction And so it's not always, but it's that basic notification. Now with that is going to go some understanding that the Alders have the ability or if they wish to have responsibility to share those notifications with interested parties. Some of the neighborhoods, most of the neighborhoods in district 13 I think do a really good job of communicating Between the older and the neighborhood associations, but the city has 20 older Mac districts and citywide. Some of the other districts don't have a lot of development. And maybe no neighborhood association don't know about every office building this game built somewhere, but we're still going to set the system up to let the Alders run the notification side of things to let them know that projects are moving through the process. The next question says, Will the developers be required to meet with neighborhoods. There isn't a requirement for a developer to meet with anyone for a permitted use permitted uses our adults require that one of the things that we're looking into our ways that we can Create a better opportunity for developers or give the developing property to meet with their neighbors. All the developers that I know that I've worked with that are going to build projects usually are going to want to talk to the neighbors at some point because that's kind of how we do things here. So a requirement is very tricky because of the permitted use. There really isn't a trigger for a way that we can establish a specific requirement. Just not one of them figured out today. And then the last question is, will adjacent neighborhoods be notified of developments that will affect them as well. Once again, that leads kind of back to sending notice to the older persons and then distributing those notices around another enhancement that we're looking at with our project software is a map where you can dial up the map and see projects that are in the area geographically so it's not going to be tied to districts for all the minute. All right, thank you. Part of Madison's proposed up zoning includes the possibility of property owners adding units to their houses and garages. What will be the approval process for adding these and what requirements will there be for legal apartment for a legal apartment unit. We'll take this one to her. Sure, be great. So yeah, this is something that one of the consequences results of the amendments that in some cases with these districts, there is going to be the ability to add additional units to buildings because when you lower the lottery per billion required and use welcome space required on existing lots you might have an opportunity to add a growing unit to the basement for examples, it's not uncommon we've only been in a few cases. So, that is a possibility, if the property is a is a permitted use it's basically going through that site plan review process for the zoning and land use approval. So, this is where the city's reviewing agencies are going to take a look at the project from a perspective of the ordinances that they administer typically we're talking about city engineering traffic engineering, the fire department and the zoning office, the main ones to take a look at and parks also looks at it and they collect a impact fee for growing that's that are added. This is adding units to basically single two family and multifamily, the existing building I'm describing here. The legal requirements for the apartment and unit are going to be those requirements for a building code, so they will need to comply with the life safety requirements in the building. Question about adding to your garage. At this point in time, we are not this series of amendments has it doesn't have anything to do with accessory to go in and so those are those often referred to as granny flats or backyard colleges, home that you'd like. This is not related to that those today are allowed it owner occupied single family homes. And on our list. We have a long list of things that we're doing, and we're going to housing. And one of the next items on the list is looking at the city's policy for accessory dwelling units the same if there's a process or appropriate way to allow those and first house. Thank you, Matt. So number five is Bay Creek along with the rest of South Madison is experience the shortage of three bedroom units for families, changing the zoning code as proposed with an emphasis on adding more smaller units will not address this problem. Why is the city's facility developers proposal for more upscale small units rather than focusing on promoting solutions needed for the family for more family housing. I would say that the proposed changes really don't have anything to do with the number of bedrooms that one might have in a development proposal so there, there isn't, in fact, an emphasis on adding more small units, I think that it may have been confused when I said, and I have been saying for months that this really does pertain to the smaller scale multifamily and what I really mean by that is number of actual apartment units within a building. Typically we see a lot of, you know, 60 to 100 even 200 300 unit buildings, coming in, and a lot of single family homes but not very much in between and so what we're trying to do as an element of these changes is to promote more of that small scale, meaning, two to, you know, 30 or more units, housing units within within buildings that move forward predictably, but that's not to say there's there's anything in the code regarding the number of bedrooms per unit. And so I think we'd expect to see a, you know, a variety of unit types, different numbers of bedrooms. Is it typical to see units that are three bedroom or is that a typical. I would say it's, it's really only been typical when the city or others are directly subsidizing units for low income, you know, income restricted housing. We know that there are many families with very low incomes who really need three bedroom units or four bedroom units and so the city does, you know, require a set number of those larger units within our affordable housing projects that we that we subsidize. We don't see a lot of three bedroom units happening in the market today. We do see a variety of studios one bedrooms and two bedrooms and every once in a while there are some three bedrooms included in in market rate development, but the number is not not significant. And I think part of that is due to the price point once at the market rate. When a three bedroom unit is constructed at market rate, it often is, it could be significantly more expensive than renting a larger single family home so there just isn't much of a market for the three bedroom units, another important exception is student housing when there's housing that's focused on students right near UW Madison, a lot of those units are three or four bedroom units. Thank you. And the next question is according to research up zoning is not likely to lead to lower rent and hot markets such as Madison where depressing rent through increased housing supply can take as much as 40 years. Why does the city believe this will be different in Madison. Yeah, I think this is this is one of the questions that the Council's really wrestling with as well. I think in Madison like with many other cities across the country. We are, we are trying desperately to catch up to create more housing supply or rather, the city to be a partner to lead to the creation of more housing supply in order to meet our, our, our needs as our city continues to grow and change. Right now our vacancy rate as a city is still very low, hovering between two and 3%, where a healthy vacancy rate is 5%. And so really adding thousands more housing units is still needed just to create that healthy vacancy rate of about 5%. And so, while, while I think it is true that a lot of new units in and of themselves will not be less expensive than the ones that exist today. I think we have to ask ourselves as a city, what would happen if we don't do this? What would happen if we don't create ways to foster a growing supply of housing stock to meet our needs and I think the answer to that is that existing housing prices would continue to go up, even at faster rates than they're going up today. Thank you. I think this is our last question. Number seven is the city has touted up zoning as filling in the missing middle of housing in Madison, and as a social justice oriented correction towards zoning code, tearing down existing affordable housing and replacing it with denser or expensive units means eviction displacement and increase property taxes that developers pass under renters as higher rents. Additionally, since smaller developers cannot compete with the large real estate investment trust that can offer to purchase land rights and use and at more than appraised property values, Uploading benefits large and not necessarily local developers. This is already happening in South Madison. How would the city prevent this displacement and gentrification from occurring? So there's a lot in this question or set of comments and I think, you know, the city's trying to use a broad range of tools related to the last question, how can we prevent displacement and gentrification from occurring. I think that gentrification occurs as redevelopment occurs and displacement is the unintended consequence of that, that the city most is most interested in mitigating. What we want to do as a city and Audre Evers can speak to this as well is invest heavily in affordable housing that's income restricted for the long term 30, 40 plus years. And we want to do that in attractive places to live that are well served by transit, parks, schools, grocery stores, other amenities. We want to focus that city investment on places that are, you know, otherwise most likely to develop at market rates. So we want to make sure that we're getting as much affordable housing, both deeply affordable and to the, you know, 80, 60, 80% of the area median income included in those areas. Some examples are South Park Street and the Capitol East District and other transit corridors, even Cottage Grove Road has a couple brand new projects. The near north side, you know, the Oscar Meyer site has a couple where we're really trying to focus on those areas that are well served by transit and other amenities when we invest as a city in affordable housing. I think there are also direct investments in households, so direct investments in people by assisting folks in buying their first home, and we want to make sure that we're, that we as a city collectively are supporting homeownership particularly for homeowners who are people of color. So I think that's a good example of how we can make sure that we're supporting people if at all possible. There are definite legal issues that get in the way of choosing certain households or choosing certain developers to support. Elder Evers can speak to this as well. The council is focused on this issue that we need to bring our entire toolbox to this issue. We need to bring direct subsidy. We need to make sure that we're, you know, supporting new housing that's that's deeply affordable within gentrifying areas. And we also, meanwhile, need to look at our regulatory framework and simply make changes so as to support more housing period, we need more housing of all types everywhere in Madison and frankly in the county and region as a whole, in order to meet our growth in the coming years. So, that prompts just a clarification on my part that is it, as far as the existing zoning codes as these denser buildings get built, is there requirements for them to have a mix of at market value and like say 50% or 60% market value to try and bring to focus it on more affordable? I think I'll let John take that one. Yeah, so we can't, because Wisconsin has a prohibition on inclusionary zoning, which inclusionary zoning is when Madison used to have an inclusionary zoning ordinance back in the early 2000s. And the developer who was going to develop something and add more than 10 units at a particular project was going to be required to include a certain percentage of units as affordable housing. That ordinance was struck down by the Supreme Court and then several years ago, the legislature actually enacted a prohibition on inclusionary zoning so we can't as a part of this particular proposal, include a requirement that all new multifamily units include a certain number of affordable housing. The only way that we can do that is, as Heather talked about, get out the toolbox and provide direct financial funding for projects. So if we, for example, give TIF money, if we, for example, give money from the affordable housing fund to a developer who is going to develop a multifamily unit, then we, in those circumstances we can require affordable housing. If we don't do that, then state law limits our ability to do that. All right, thank you. And like I said, that's our last question. So, at this point I think there was an intent to open it up to questions. If you'll take down your screen sharing, then I can see everybody and so if folks want to use the raised hand function. And then, since you can't see them, Mark, if it's all right if I recognize the people who raised their hands, or how do you want to handle that? I can actually see them now that I've stopped screen sharing. Okay, good. So we'll give everybody a minute to raise their hand if they have a question. All right, I have one from the raised hand function. If you look at the, if you hover over the bottom of your zoom window, where you see the mute button. On the right hand side there's one called reaction, you click on that and you'll see raise hand. Let's see, maybe that's it. No, that's clap. I don't see raise, I've got a thumbs up and a clap. It should be in that same window and it's down at the bottom. All right, there. Thank you. That's right. I don't have, I don't have that at all. Well I tell you what we'll put you on the list. Do you have a question. I did. Yeah, the last one. Yeah, I'm going to add you to the list. Yes. Okay, Peter. So, let's start with Jim. Yep. So we got Jim Winkle had his hand raised. Yeah, thanks. So, I'm wondering, this seems, it seems like a overall a good idea. But I'm wondering if it's enough and I'm wondering if you all are, if the city is thinking about other things to encourage more, a little more in Phil in conjunction with this. Matt, do you want to talk about some of the things that that elders have approached you with for later this year or. Right, I alluded to our earlier discussed how there's been some discussions about possibly looking a little more flexibly and how we allow accessory dwelling units. In particular, one of the things that we've noticed is that if someone is actually taking their, the envelope of their home, and they're splitting up a little bit to create an additional unit. There's been a physical change that happens on the lot, and in many ways you're kind of keeping the same bulk on the lot where the house sits. So, one of the more sensitive issues related to accessory going units is the dream of backyard and then you can kind of, you know, neighbors backyards to not that that necessarily happens but it's one of the issues so one of the things we've been looking at is the possibility of adding a basement apartment or attached addition type secondary dwelling units onto single family homes. It principally only works with single family homes because they stay in the one and two family building code, where anytime that you go from a two unit to a three unit or you're adding to a multifamily unit, you're working in that commercial building code which is prohibitively expensive in regards to things like sprinkler and fire separation and floor loading and accessibility and things like that. We've been looking at that there's been some side discussions about that. We've also, and what I'm talking about is allowing those by right, making that like a permitted allowance thing where someone can just come in and get a permit for that type of thing. Similarly, there's been discussions about and were basically pre approved plans for accessory growing units and and potential like pre approved location type places that would circumvent the conditional use process, which is about a nine week process process and it costs, there's not basically about 600 bucks and it just takes time which, which adds expense to projects. And so later on this year, I will be working with the stories of Alders Alder Evers is one of the Alders who's expressed interest in visiting that policy and touching on those both of those matters. I would like to mention something on the other end of the scale, you know not within these zoning districts that we've talked about today which is about 7% of the city, but we have plans in progress within the planning division to really reimagine the the two mall areas East town and West town which are on either side of what will hopefully be our first bus rapid transit quarter going east to west. We've recently completed a redevelopment plan for the Oscar Meyer area. And we think that areas like that will accommodate, you know, highly intensive new development that probably won't be within within these zoning districts specifically we've just created a new zoning district called the regional mixed use zoning district that we think will be applied to portions of the Oscar Meyer site, and probably eventually to portions of the east town and West town areas in the future. We do see those areas you can envision them now as seas of parking, a lot of space already well served by transit but a lot of space to really support our our growing population. Now it needs a lot of investment parks streets etc to really evolve those those areas into something new but I think that again on the other end of that scale. We have tremendous opportunities for infill that's transit oriented in those areas are just to name a few. Thanks. So then, next we had Wendy for inside, raise your hand if you want to ask your question Wendy. unmute me, there we go. Yeah, I have two questions and I'll ask one and then leave my hand up so if you have time to come back to me I appreciate chance to ask the second one, but it seems, it seems to me like there's a very large difference in the number of units that are allowed, depending on whether the building is residential only or mixed use. And I'm having trouble wrapping my head around that because it seems like if a building of a certain size is appropriate in an area, it should you. I should something be allowed to be have twice as many units as it does in some of the zones. If there's ground floor resident commercial I just don't get that and I don't understand why that differential should be necessary to incentivize commercial. Yeah, that's a great question, Wendy I think that when, when these proposals were were first created, there wasn't that differential, and I want to answer this in two ways but that you know the plan commission heard really loud and clear some concerns about not having ground floor commercial in some of our mixed use districts. And so they decided to put forth a substitute ordinance that basically cut in half, the permitted number of units for purely residential buildings in those mixed use districts and so that's why you see in the in the substitute ordinance which is the one I covered tonight that that differential is there it's again to continue to provide an incentive for folks to pursue mixed use buildings, when it's something that can work, I think that I also wanted to add that today. Today, there's a very, very strong incentive in the zoning code to do mixed use buildings that include commercial space on the ground floor. It's it's really hard to move forward with purely residential buildings and these mixed use districts. And it's really one important tenant of the proposed changes we see such an enormous growth potential along our mixed use quarters a lot of older auto oriented commercial space with parking lots, some small lots here and there that we think would be just perfect for smaller scale developers to come in and do a three story 20 unit building rather than, you know, a four or five story 120 unit mixed use building. And so we're trying to create opportunities for a predictable path forward for those smaller scale purely residential buildings, all the while hearing the concerns loud and clear from some all there's who are really concerned that we still do want to maintain that mixed use feel along these quarters with walkable commercial spaces. So it's, that was a really great question I hope I answered it okay. Okay, thank you. Next we had Peter shopper Peter can you unmute yourself. Yeah. Can you hear me now. Yes. Okay, yeah question that comment. The question came out of the last question, or someone mentioned the problems of up zoning on the south side. I wonder if anyone could explain what's going on on the zoning on the south side. You follow me. Sure. Um, so I, you know, I don't. Are you talking about still district 13, like the wing grab triangle the South Park Street. I don't know, it was the last question that came up in the last sentence was, and we are having problems with up zoning on the south side. And so I wondered what's going on there. I mean, is this an aberration is this one person complaining or is there a problem there. Yeah, I'm just trying to understand your question I'm sorry Peter. Someone said, someone said there are problems of zoning. This was a let me reread I think you're talking about question seven which was a lot. Yeah, let me reread. Yeah, yeah, a lot there but the city has touted up zoning as filling in the missing middle of housing in Madison, and as a social justice oriented correction to our zoning code. Is that what you're referring to sir, then what was the last I think he's referring to the last, the last two sentences. Yeah, so let me read those. Searching back for periods here. Additionally, since smaller developers cannot compete with large real estate investment trust that can offer to purchase land rights at more than a pretty property values, uploading benefits large and not necessarily This is already happening in South Madison. How will this city prevent this displacement and gentrification. So I think you're referring to the this is already happening in South Madison. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Okay. So it's not the up zoning that's already happening but it's the it's the development or purchase by purchase by developers for for development proposals. Yeah, I think so. You know the city's in the midst of a planning process for South Madison. Right now and I think one of the strategies, including within the town of Madison parcels that have yet to come into the city will be to zone them appropriately to maintain what's there today. So for instance, if there are large swaths of land that are there currently single family homes and they're they're in the town of Madison today, we would recommend single family zoning for those areas rather than any any different zoning district. And so I think that's that's one element of Of your question or answer to your question. I think that okay. I'll be very blunt and frank. There is concern nationally about big equity groups coming in in disturbing real estate in cities like LA, Austin, Boston. I'm sure you're aware of that. And you feel that we're protected against that. No, I mean, I don't think any city is protected against that. But I think we can do some things to assist as a partner, the city can and one of the things that the city can do is prioritize and actually purchase property in areas like South Madison in In order to better control what happens on that property in the future. And that's called land banking. So that's another element where the city uses taxpayer dollars to purchase property works with the development community in the future to To request proposals for certain things to happen. One example recently in district 13 would be the Truman Olson site where the city was a was a player in facilitating what happened on that property. Similarly, the city also owns the site I showed 1202 South Park Street. Those are those are in the Bay Creek neighborhood. Now we're also we as a city are also considering purchase of properties further to the south in order to to guarantee The future that you know the land use is there can support the community that's there today. And so that that's one tool that the city has at our disposal. At the request of the Alder recently, Alder Evers, we did take a look at housing, at least within the city of Madison and whether it was changing from owner occupied to renter occupied at a faster pace in South Madison than the rest of the city. And it's it's not at this time. I think that I can't remember the exact numbers, but it was like maybe five homes have changed from owner occupied to renter occupied in the last five years based on the data that we have. So that's, you know, we're not seeing that trend in the data. Yeah, but I certainly know that it's you know that it's out there and that a lot of folks are concerned about it and the city has limited tools to to mitigate that. But we're certainly doing what we can to be a player in that. Okay, thank you very much. My comment is Heather. Thank you very much for the research and the time and intelligence, you put into this presentation. I'm going to key off now. I'm going to key off, but I'm skeptical of city government but you restored my face. Oh my goodness. Wow. So, no, you Peter. Well, you're wonderful. So thank you. You're doing an unbelievably good job. Tell your boss this old man said, you should get a big raise. Okay, bye bye. All right, so then the next questions from Jared Kelsey. Hi there. Well, I, I'm sorry if I'm going to rain on on Peters parade and Heather's parade but I think that there's been a little bit of confusion over the last numbers of messages that have that have come through from the city, I think that, you know, initially, you know, there's, there's been discussion saying that, you know, you want to support small scale developers. And, you know, I, I don't know that, you know, that, that what what this is spelling out is really, I think, going far enough and allowing things like two flats to be built as somebody who bought my first house in Madison 13 years ago, and somebody who bought my second home, the home next door to me. Four years ago, with the intention of having an Airbnb property next door that I can manage that's immediately next door that would my wife could could help manage and clean and upkeep. You know my, my world came crashing down last year about this time as coven and everything was hitting us. The city put in this this restriction, really because there were more than 250 Airbnb properties that existed that were regulated or permitted. And there were really only four complaint properties that existed and so there's these restrictions that have been broadcast across, you know, anybody that wanted to do Airbnb and many people that might have only needed to do Airbnb and open up their homes for major events football games, CrossFit games. You know if you look at a place like Oshkosh for example that can bring in people and let them stay for a week during EAA. We do have a problem with large, you know, large scale. You know, hotel chains that that really control a lot of that. And we do need, you know, these small scale developers these you know these homeowners to open up their homes and there's restrictions now as a result about that but anyway my question. My question that I would ask would be, you know, what, what opportunities. You know, what opportunities are you opening with this, as we look at really. Where can we, you know, where can these small scale developers, you know, find opportunity now I mean, and I'm not talking about just selling their home. You know, how can, how can we open up and look at. Does that, does that mean that a D user now going to be a potential for for being able to, you know, open up for rentals. Does that mean that Airbnb regulations are going to, you know, be viewed again. I think I could start with this. This, this series of amendments has nothing to do with the city's regulation of short terminals that Airbnb's biggest platform. That is a separate and different policy recently went through a policy discussion on that after they permit process for those, because they are really part of our combinations economy for people who are visiting. This is about places for people to live in the city. Probably the best way to think about it. And in regard to how how is this going to maybe relate to smaller scale developers and we do have a number of smaller scale type developers that own the amount of pop types they might own a four year or something like that just a few buildings I was actually talking to somebody down south of St. Mary's recently about an additional unit they want to put into their building that they can't because the density ladder for growing an open space requirement is such that there's not the ability to add an additional unit, but there's plenty of room to add a unit on that property. And that's probably help those people and our, the market of our people that own apartments various just wildly. You know you have the large scale developers and you have small scale owners. And then you have people like yourself Jared who purchased the house next door to secure it to control it when it became available that's actually something that's pretty common in English. And I'm surprised that I learned that when we did some work in English neighborhood several years ago. I just need to say Peter you need to turn off your camera please. Okay, thank you. I didn't know I didn't have access to turn that off. So, then we've got Carrie with the next question. Okay, my question follows up on Wendy's question, and the difference between the density allowed for mixed use dwellings and not mixed use dwelling on the fact that not all mixed use areas are the same. East wash West wash South Park Street are a different animal entirely than a street like lakeside street, which has a mixed use section of old buildings that are sandwiched in between homes, or the homes are sandwiched in between the old buildings are mixed use. And I think that it seems to my understanding and maybe I'm wrong here, the same changes in zoning would apply to this small residential street, as to some of the more major streets in the city and that seems on the one hand inevitable because you're not looking lot by plot, but on the other hand a mistake, because we need to be looking lot by lot and plot by plot. And with the elimination of the conditional use process. How will we make those distinctions how we, how will we protect the residential streets like lakeside street from from having a huge building next door to a small home. That's the end of my question. Sure, no I think that's a good question. Again, in that I tried to get at this with with Wendy's question as well but in today's code there aren't any density limitations at all for mixed use buildings in any of the mixed use districts now. As you know, and many of you who are involved with development review in the city, the plan commission will look at adopted plans and we'll look at the density density ranges in those plans and the proposed limits to building height that are shown in our, in our sub area plans, and that helps to inform their decision. But in the zoning code, there aren't any density limitations to the mixed use districts today so that's something that it isn't new. It's, it's carrying forward but it's not really a part of this proposal. I think that what what Carrie what you're asking is, if we allow for some things that the smaller and sometimes mid scale to move forward as a permitted use. What are we, what are we losing, and I think that's at the essence of really these, these proposals is, you know, for decades now, every single multifamily building in Madison has involved conditional use review discretionary review process, public plan commission, and that can't be said for office buildings industrial buildings, certainly not for single family homes really multifamily buildings have been treated differently in Madison for decades and really across the country, we're not alone in this. So what we're trying to do as a city, as recommended in our comprehensive plan and many other housing reports is to take a look at ways that we can make modest changes to the zoning code to allow for that smaller scale residential to move forward, so that we're, we're basically allowing what our plans call for to move forward more predictably and by right and I think that folks can certainly have some have and show some concerns about have we chosen the right scale, have we chosen the right threshold to move forward with. Certainly that was a big part of the plan commission discussion back in late March, where they put forth a substitute that they're really ratcheted that down as far as what could be allowable by right in our mixed use, mixed use districts. So I think that's you know it's an important question. I continue to say that I think what's before the council is relatively modest in scope, the changes are are not what we're seeing in some other major cities where the densities are increasing, perhaps four fold through true up sonings. These are, these are modest changes couched very deeply in recommendations that the council has had for years regarding ways that we can make it easier to to meet our housing needs by focusing on that missing middle. And that does take into account context or it doesn't I mean I think I get what you're saying and that makes sense. I think my question had to do with, does the shoe fit every time, and do we sometimes have have to look at the context of where the mixed use building is and what processes are there, or will there be for looking at that. If, if it lakeside coffee is on a PD lot, and some of the tiny little ancient buildings, our neighborhood mixed use. My understanding is that this would allow for those to be up zoned. Considerably, not, not excessively but considerably, and yet the building next door is a two family home, or even a one story home. How, so I'm saying that I'm aware of this simply because I live on this street, there must be other streets like this in Madison, where there may be need for special consideration and I'm not seeing that in the process that is being described. How would we deal with that, or is this one of the unfortunate consequences. Maybe not what we would desire but what we are going to live with because of this need for more housing. Heather, I might be able to take a quick stab at this to give you a little break, but one of the things to think about is on this issue of neighborhood input and the ability to sort of look at a particular project. We talked about process it in that process does take place during the neighborhood planning portion when you're talking about the plans and we're talking about these areas that are called for for these types of dwelling units, and that really is the, the place that that those considerations can take into a place whether particular areas parcels streets are appropriate for that sort of a development. So that's different than saying that it has to happen at the conditional use process. And one of the focuses of of these ordinances is to take the emphasis off the conditional use process, because the what's being proposed has already been is is consistent with the plan that was adopted by the Common Council when that neighborhood was input was taken with respect to those plans being developed. And as Heather mentioned, over decades across the country. And one of the ways that it was that was done was through outright prohibitions. And another way that it was done was through the creation of conditional use processes that had standards of consideration that could be similar to our standard number three, which is relatively And so, so the real question is, there is a process it's at the neighborhood planning process, but not necessarily at the conditional use process and I think some of these unintended consequences. Some of the people that have talked throughout the legislative process is it's really not a function of flipping the switch from conditional to permitted, because that that alone isn't necessarily the thing that's creating the unintended consequences. It's really a step back and say, you know, what is intended for the street what is intended for these parcels this particular ordinance really, really just enacts those policies that have been that have been made before so again taking the emphasis off the individual Ad hoc conditional use process and relying on the plans that have been adopted before. I don't understand how we can mistake. I think that makes sense. But you're, I, you're, that does answer my question. Thank you. And you do something like that. You shouldn't be doing this job. Nobody's not more than a good cop. I could tell you that straight up somebody to mute Cindy. Wendy, can you move. And since we don't have any other hands up when to get asked to have one last question. Thank you. One of the rationales for the proposed ordinance change was to provide more certainty about what's allowed for developers for development and when we have a situation where there is no limit on number of units or the heights of buildings in the conditional use process, it seems that the certainty is provided to people who want to make the change in a development, but not to the neighbors in terms of what kind of development really can go on that property. I'm wondering if you have considered including limits on number of units and building heights in those districts where you're permitting higher densities as a result of this zoning change. I'm wondering if you have any explanation about what's appropriate in those areas. Yeah, that's another really good question, Wendy, I think that as Carrie was saying, the areas, even if they're within the same zoning district, they can vary pretty significantly. You know, the CCT district is the Winkler Triangle. It's also parts of far out East Washington Avenue, close to Easttown Mall. It's also along Cottage Grove Road. And so, in some places, buildings that are, you know, eight stories are called for in our adopted plans and would be just fine, while in most, they probably would not, you know, they probably would not be, you know, compatible with the development around them. At this point, we haven't been discussing adding absolute height limits within the zoning code within these mixed use districts, although they do exist in most of the residential districts that I showed. It's two, three stories in most of those residential districts maximum. But one thing we have been discussing with the Plan Commission is a new way of doing our sub area plans throughout the city that includes a height map, basically, just like what we have in the downtown. And I'm not sure if anyone here is familiar with the way that zoning in the downtown works, but we have a zoning height map that sets the maximum allowable heights in our downtown area. And one of the recommendations in our city's comprehensive plan was to think about expanding that mechanism further out in other parts of the city. And so that's something that we are considering. We've been in conversations with the Plan Commission about that. And I think that it could, just as you're suggesting, it could add a lot more predictability to the development process along some of the more rapidly changing mixed use corridors. If folks on all sides of the issue had a sense that, well, the maximum height here is going to be six stories or four stories or three. It might take that kind of out of the equation of concern or whatever for projects. So I think that's a really good suggestion. And it's one that we're contemplating just in a little bit different way than in this package of zoning ordinances. Well, that's very good to hear. I think it's an important thing to do. In my own experience here along Monroe Street, what's been approved is not consistent with the plan and with the adopted plan and the height and that kind of thing. And it just seems like anything goes. So I do think it's important to have more predictability and to have things match more closely between the plan and what's approved. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. We intended that to be our last question. I think I see one more hand raised. John, did you have a question? Yeah, I guess it's kind of a comment. But, you know, one of the things that I see here that's happening is that we're really taking the neighborhood associations and the neighbors out of the discussion, which they were always included through the conditional use process. And so we're going to lose a voice here. And I think that even though we kind of consider that these multi housing units along Monroe Street, we're getting second class citizenship, as Attorney Strange was pointing out, I think that the neighborhood input was hugely important in the Trader Joe's building, the urban land interest building, the Hotel Red, the building where the new, where the associated buildings are. Where the associated bank is and then further up the block. All of those buildings had significant input from the neighbors and changes were made based on what the neighbors really were concerned about in the neighborhood. And I'm a little concerned that we're going to lose that mechanism for neighbors and neighborhood associations to have any significance. I might be able to respond to that, John. Thanks for that question. For all those development projects that you mentioned, conditional use, even with the zoning changes would be required. So the question is really a matter of the thresholds. And if you look at the various zoning districts that this touches on in District 13, particularly the along Monroe Street, Regent Street and South Park, none of the projects that have been approved recently that required conditional use. So, except for one, I think at the Jade Garden restaurant would skip the conditional use process. So neighborhood input with these zoning changes is not going to be removed from the consideration. There'll still be a fair amount of neighborhood input. I know that's a concern that people have. They think that neighborhood voice is going to be lost entirely on these more controversial projects. That's not the case. Well, the one example that Heather gave was where the library is now, and they could be a fairly significant building put up there without any conditional use permit. So in that case, I would think the neighborhood would have lost their voice but they may have missing something. I think we looked at, we analyzed this pretty closely and in past presentation I've shared this, but if you look back over the last five years at about 10,000 multifamily housing units that have been approved by the city's plan commission and council, just about less than 400 of them would have been permitted under these proposed changes. So it's less than 4%. Now moving forward, we hope that that number inches up a little bit. I mean really what that means is we're not seeing very much small scale, missing middle housing built at all, and we want to see these changes lead to more of that due to the predictability, and I think that's another factor that we're looking at. I think that's another factor that we're looking at is the fact that a smaller scale developer entering the market can know exactly what they can construct on a given property and not have to aggregate three or four properties to put forth a 150 unit project with a commercial first floor. Again, it's important to offer that predictability, particularly to developers who don't have the profit in their future to be able to hold on to a vacant commercial space or to be able to aggregate three, four, five properties along a corridor. So it's really providing that opportunity for small scale entry level developers to build some of this missing middle housing that we haven't seen much of. All right, thank you. At this point we don't have any other questions. I want to thank everybody for your time and your participation in the answers and the questions. I think it's been a really good exchange. So with that, unless Tagg, there was anything else you wanted to say about how we, I think there's a meeting coming up. Is there anything about that that you wanted to share before we close the meeting? I want to say thanks to the staff that showed up here tonight, Heather, Matt and John. Thanks for your participation. I want to say thanks to Mark for doing a great job facilitating and thanks to all of you for being here. Being here. This does come before council on May 18th. You certainly can express your concerns by writing to all elders and you also can write and reach out to me directly at district 13 at cityofmadison.com. I also have office hours every Friday morning from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and you can come and talk to me about this particular proposal. Let me know what your concerns are. But I appreciate you all being here very much. Thanks everybody. Have a good night. Thank you everyone.
