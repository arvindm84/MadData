============================================================

 There we go, we're connected and I will put back on that screen. Thank you for being with me on that. All right, so the meeting is recording moving forward with videos on or off, whatever you prefer. So this meeting here's an agenda for how this meeting will go. My name is Sydney Prusak. I'm a development review planner with the city planning division. I'm joined by my colleague, Kevin Furko, who is the principal planner for the development review section in the planning division. Before we get into the weeds of the development, I'll give a brief Zoom tutorial. And I will then turn over to the altar for a brief introduction. And then I'll go over the adopted plans and zoning for the subject sites and just the general development review process. Then I'll turn over to the development team for them to present their project. And then we'll open it up for questions and a discussion to follow. So this meeting is for residents to learn about the development, ask questions and provide feedback. We'll open it up for discussion and questions after the developers presentation and please one speaker at a time. Again, I'm asking you all to remain muted until that question and answer time. We're not going to stop for questions during the meeting, but I'll explain how to use our raise hand function when we get to the Q&A point of this presentation. So again, please keep your microphone muted. If you're getting a signal that your connection is unstable or you're having difficulty hearing me, a lot of times it helps to just turn your video off. And then again, like I said, you will use the raise hand function if you'd like to speak. This is an example of what Zoom looks like or may look like. Where it has this reaction button, that's where you can find that raise hand function. And again, on the left side, that helps you work your video and your audio. So if you have questions during the meeting or don't, if your video or audio is not working or you don't feel comfortable asking your question in front of everybody, you can email Kevin or I those questions during the meeting. I'll keep that up now in case you need to write that down or save it and then I'll turn it over right now before I get started to alter Revere to give an introduction as this project is in his district. Well, thank you very much, Sydney. I really appreciate your efforts tonight to facilitate us as along with those of your colleague, Kevin Burko. For those of you that I don't have the honor and privilege of knowing, I am Mike Revere and I do have the honor and privilege of representing much of the downtown on the Madison City Council, including the block in question tonight. I really appreciate the tremendous amount of interest in this proposal and in your attendance this evening. This is the first large publicly noticed public meeting of any sort to discuss this proposal. This proposal is monumental in many respects. I say that without taking a position on the proposal at this time. It's monumental monumental of course in terms of the scale and massing of the buildings involved here, including potentially asking for additional stories to be approved beyond what's allowed under today's zoning code. Additionally, it's monumental in terms of the sheer amount of density of housing that's proposed and it's also monumental certainly in terms of its very highly visible location. It's not often that we have development proposals on State Street proper and this proposal of course includes the corner of State and West Gorham streets. I want to state at the outset that the proposal obviously has led to the displacement of some of the existing retail in this on this block. It's something that I very much mourn the loss of are those long be loved institutions that have chosen to leave the downtown in part because of this proposal and losing their leases later this year if the proposal is approved. Those of course include a room of one's own and community pharmacy. I'm thrilled that they're able to survive and moreover probably likely thrive in their new locations. I just wish that they were able to stay in the core downtown area. So I am sorry for that and I want to acknowledge that right at the outset here. There are no existing residential units on the site in question. So it's all commercial spaces that would be displaced under this proposal. The amount of housing that is proposed here is significant as I say and we will get into all of these details and more during the course of the meeting this evening. The proposal has been presented at its infancy before meetings of capital neighborhoods incorporated the officially recognized neighborhood association on this block as well as the adjacent neighborhood association the campus area neighborhood association. So some of you tonight I know have seen this proposal in its earlier incarnation in those neighborhood meetings. Additionally, the proposal has been before the city's landmarks Commission and urban design Commission once each respectively for initial advisory opinions on the part of those respective commissioners. The proposal has not yet been introduced to the city in the form of a formal land use application. I appreciate the development team holding off until we could have more public input on their proposal at this stage, including tonight's meeting. At the conclusion of tonight's meeting the next step from my perspective is having the development team work on a more intimate basis with stakeholders from downtown. We have volunteers that have already agreed to not only co chair, but also others to serve on what we call a neighborhood steering committee. For those of you that aren't familiar, this is a long standing practice downtown where the neighborhood association for most of the downtown area most downtown neighborhoods. Again, as I say is capital neighborhoods, Inc. CNI CNI has long provided wonderful guidance through their volunteer activism to policymakers like myself to city staff like the city planners that are facilitating tonight's meeting. And more importantly, I would say of all to providing very valuable feedback and input to developers along the way. So year after year after year we have had neighborhood steering committees work with downtown development teams to try to improve their proposals and make them better. Make them be better neighbors, perhaps fit in better with the neighborhood fabric and so forth. So at the conclusion of this meeting, I would hope that many of you in attendance tonight would consider joining us and volunteering to serve on that neighborhood steering committee. It will be co chaired by Tim camps of the Mifflin district of CNI and I'm all Goyal the president of campus area neighborhood association. Those gentlemen will again facilitate those meetings moving forward. This late spring and into the early summer and any of you that are willing to volunteer for that please let me know personally, or let or let those folks know if you know the information on how to get a hold of of Tim and a mall perhaps they could share their contact information in the chat function. And in terms of those of you that are interested in volunteering to serve on these on this steering committee which would meet via zoom again over the coming months. So with that, let me thank all of you again for being with us let me thank the development team for early and often engaging with the neighborhood and for their patients. Thank you all for being with us today and I look forward to the presentation as we set up this first large publicly noticed neighborhood meeting, and I look forward to the presentation, and we're over your questions and feedback and input, moving forward both tonight and beyond. So thank you very much, and I'll send things back to you Sydney. Just a quick note you sparked another thought on the chat actually is disabled for this meeting just because it's easy to lose track of that so after this meeting I can will have a list of registrants that we want to send out those contact information. And I realized while this was presenting Kevin's email was misspelled it's paper go not K I, or go so if you got a spam email flashback that's why so tried to change that on the fly so if you again if you have questions during the meeting, feel free to send them I will be many. You know, I have it on my other screen. Um, so I guess before we get into the development proposal let's just start at the start. And this is kind of a confusing map but this is the city zoning map for the downtown area. As you can see there's a lot of lines and a lot of colors but I tried my best to outline the project site in this yellow. This red color delineates different zoning districts so as you can see, the subject site actually crosses two different zoning districts. One is downtown core and one is urban mixed use on both support relatively high density mixed use development so they can accommodate residential employment commercial some institutional uses so that's the basis of how development starts, then after we look at the zoning for property, we look at another beautiful map. This is from the city's comprehensive plan which guides development for the entire city so it's pretty broad but it does make site specific recommendation so as you can see the subject site is in this light blue color which is recommended for downtown mixed use. And in the plan the plan says that downtown mixed use areas are generally more focused on residential retail and service uses, then downtown core which is the area over here by the capital which is more has more employment uses. So, this is a comprehensive plan, like I said it's pretty broad and the comprehensive plan always gives deference to neighborhood plans. And in this case the neighborhood plan for the area is the downtown plan. So I'm going to show you one more map I promise this is the last one. But again, a map with a lot of colors a lot of numbers. But we'll get through it. So here is the subject site again, and this is the building height map for the downtown area. The zoning districts for the downtown all give deference to this height map. You can see there are three different recommendations so there's four stories along State Street, six stories further back and then eight stories. So a lot of you are probably thinking this is a proposal for a building that's larger than eight stories. So, in order to achieve this building. The development team is requesting approval of a plan development. So plan development is a site specific zoning district that really dictates, and they can dictate the amount of height, the height, the use, the number of units, the building materials, and it's all specific on that site. But because that is a specific ask it requires quite a few approvals. So this is the whole development process summary. Some of you may be familiar with this but again a lot of you may be new to the process. So right now, we're in this pre application phase so that's when the developer meets with the neighborhood groups like this meeting, or just a larger neighborhood meeting, and forms the altar and neighborhood association about their proposal. And during this phase the applicant went for advisory informational presentation to the urban design commission, and they also went to the landmarks commission for review of the buildings proposed for demolition. Once this phase is done, the applicant will submit application to the city for review, and that application will be distributed to a variety of city agencies. So it'll go to fire engineering traffic engineering parks forestry zoning planning. I always miss one so sorry if any of you are representatives from that agency. But then all the agencies will review the proposal and provide comments and conditions of approval to planning staff, then all those comments will be compiled into a staff report. And then like I said this is a plan development so it requires quite a bit of public hearings. So first is at the urban design commission, and this will commission will, like it sounds will review the design of the building so they're really focused on the architecture, the site plan the massing landscaping of the building. Then after urban design, we'll go to plan commission and plan commission will look at the adopted plans and the maps that I showed and the land use and how it relates to the surrounding uses on State Street and downtown. Then after playing commission, they'll go to common council for another public hearing, and a final decision so as you can see there are a lot of opportunities to get involved at that public hearing process separate from the neighborhood steering committee but I just like to get this out ahead of time that the urban like I said the urban design commission is really focused on design so if you register to speak at that meeting. Please note that that's what they're focusing on and the plan commission and council is more aware of gets to the actual land use so right now we're in that So right now we're in that pre application discussion phase. I'm sure that the applicant will discuss when they intend to submit their application. And then we'll go from there. So, again, here are Kevin and my emails in case there are questions during this meeting or afterwards, feel free to contact us. I'm going to stop my share now and hopefully this goes seamlessly and I will turn it over to the development team who should be able to share their screen and then they can get started and again, we'll hold questions till the end and we'll use that raise hand function so Jeff I'll turn it over to you. All right, well thank you Sydney well Jeff is pulling up the presentation for tonight I'll just do a brief set of introductions for the development team. My name is Brian Munson, I'm a principal with vandal and associates on urban design and planning firm here in Madison. And with us tonight. Jeff Solisco from Antunavich associates who's the architect for the project, as well as Marco housing from core spaces, of course, the developer of the proposed project. We really appreciate everybody taking time tonight to get an opportunity to present some of the early process steps and discussion of the project, as Cindy mentioned, this is a part of the pre application process and what we've been trying to do over the span of the last Several months is to hold meetings with different groups get information out and get feedback refine the project and continue to advance the design of the project. So that we can begin to prepare for a formal submittal so we really appreciate everybody taking the time tonight to take a look at what the proposal looks like, as well as give us feedback and for those of you who have seen the project previously. You'll note that there have been quite a few changes along the way. And so we're very much interested in your feedback tonight, so that we can build a stronger application and really address questions that may arise. So just to kind of step into the project. As Sydney mentioned, we're on the block bounded by Gorham State broom and Johnson. It is not all of the parcels on that block. In fact, less than the majority of the state street frontage is included. And I also note that the historic farm that's the firehouse on Brim and Johnson is not included either. So as you see here from an aerial view, we're looking at a site for an opportunity of something we're very excited about for a really an infill Redevelopment project that's focused on delivering some housing options for primarily targeted towards students, but will also include some young professional and market rate housing potential in here. We see this as a great opportunity to bring some much needed density kind of in the mid state street range and expand opportunities for housing that include student housing, affordable student housing in many different formats throughout the building. We also have a great opportunity to continue the vibrancy at the streetscape level by preserving the existing facades of several of the buildings at the same time as expanding opportunities for first floor commercial along State Street, Gorham and Johnson. This is coupled up with amenities and support of the residents within the building with the lobby space being at the corner of broom and Gorham streets. And then finally, an opportunity that we're excited about to bring some incubator space to the retail frontages as well. So hopefully, an opportunity to launch new businesses that could either incubate on this site and then move into State Street or just in the general community. Again, this is a conversation that has been going on for for several months, as we have been working through the process. We started with a strong foundation of looking at exactly what Sydney presented here tonight and that is what are the adopted plans call for. In that as identified as downtown core and urban mixed use so you have, you know, some framework of zoning that supports mixed use at a higher density on this site. Then we looked very closely at the height plans, and that's something that we are requesting some additional height on this project but doing that in a sensitive manner in the context of the buildings that are around us. You know immediately across the street we have 12 story and eight story building. We're right up the street from less than 100 feet away from 10 and 12 story building so we feel that the context support some additional height here. It also allows us to do some very important things with this project. Number one is actually allows us to go under the height limits along State Street. State Street is identified for up to four stories and the proposal you'll see tonight actually holds that back to three stories for that first step back. But then the building design really flows from the step backs that are called for in the height plan and as Jeff shows the concepts that will come through much clearer, but it really does try to step and stage the height away from State Street out towards broom and gore and Johnson to the outer edges of the site so that you have logical transitions to some of the existing taller buildings. The final two pieces that allow the additional height allows us to do is to one incorporate a lot of green sustainable project components into this project. So you'll see a significant green roof elements, but also we are looking at integrating green building standards throughout the building and all the different mechanical systems, structural systems and design of the building itself to incorporate opportunities for enhanced sustainability within the project. The last piece that the additional height really supports is the ability to offer a significant portion of this project for affordable student housing. It's something we've reached out to the university and talked with the university about an opportunity to create around 10% of the sites within this project as affordable student housings available to qualified applicants within the student population. Something that hasn't really been done a lot within the city and I would also note that we're doing this entirely through self funded within the project itself. We're not asking for TIFT assistance to support that. We're not asking for tax credits to support that. In essence, really taking a page out of the old inclusionary zoning handbook. For those of you that remember the ordinance that used to be on the books, one of the things that it really leaned towards was the idea of bonus density to support affordability and that's exactly what we're doing here. So trying to couple up a really sensitive design to the context around us with the opportunities to deliver green sustainable building and really expanded affordable housing within this project, something we're very excited to do. And so with that, what I'd like to do is turn it over to Jeff to kind of walk through where we are with the design and I would note for those that saw the plans previously, there's a whole lot more detail tonight. So we're excited to present really what this building starts to feel like and look like all the way around the project. So I'll turn that over to Jeff. Great. Thank you, Brian. Again, this is Jeff Solis. I'm the senior principal with Antunovich Associates. We're architects engaged by Core Spaces to participate in this project. I wanted to show you an even more detailed version of the present site plan surrounding our site. These existing buildings will remain along State Street as they are on the dashed line delineates the site, the firehouse building remains. Interesting thing when you see all this with the buildings, the existing buildings that are a part of this is there's also a significant amount of parking spaces, about 33% of the site are existing surface parking spaces. Obviously, as we move along with our building, we would camouflage those spaces so that they're integrated into the building instead of being surface parking spaces that are visible from the street and from the sidewalks. So first floor plan, really a very important part of the building. You can see in this yellow area there are significant retail components within the building along State and GORM, and then along the Johnson. On Johnson we keep the retail as close as possible as we can to State Street we feel that that's the best location in total. There's about 20 between 22 and 23,000 square feet of retail. Also along GORM you see that we continue our lobby in a coffee shop area as part of that so there's really going to be a lot of activity along really around the block based on what we're doing with what we're proposing on this project. Another important component is the alley, the existing alley is only 16 feet wide to allow this area that alley to be a fire access drive we're making it 26 feet. This also helps our neighbors on State Street to have a wider alley to be able to navigate handle vans and trucks like that. Also we are providing space on our property for them for their trash and trash bins along our site so that's something we're doing to be good neighbors and help them with the operation of their properties. In addition, you see on the site a significant amount of parking so there is parking access down, you know through the building off of Johnson Street that is the only access and egress point. There was also ramp down to parking below. We will within this parking structure have several spaces for drop off and pickup of for Uber type functions drop off for food for things like that so those will be things that will come into the garage in and out of that garage through the Johnson Street exit and egress point. Also on this level you'll see we provide the required bike parking including gas bike parking, and I'll go in through the numbers on those in a moment but we made it exceed the code requirements for all of these uses. One other thing I wanted to point out is you see the property you'll see that our property, we are set back from the property line around significant portions of our building and we're doing that to maintain 15 foot sidewalks. We think that that's very important to have a proper sidewalk with so we are setting our building back from the property line to satisfy those. Those the sidewalk requirements, we believe are going to be increased the requirements will be increased to 15 feet but that is not happening now but we're kind of getting ahead of the curve on that requirement. There's also below grade parking 150 spaces. Altogether we have 100, 212 parking spaces and closed parking spaces between the first floor and the lower level. I want to point out that we have 600 650 bike parking spaces to meet the requirements for this project we have 64 guest bike parking spaces, and 102 moped parking spaces within this property, specifically within the parking structure area on the first floor in the Move up to the residential floor so this is the first residential floor you see that there is a fitness component within this. In addition to the units I wanted to point out that the units in addition to the affordable housing units that will be layered throughout the building. We have units that range from micro studios, the studios, one bedroom, two bedroom, three bedroom, four bedroom, five bedroom units so that hits allows poor to hit the market at different price points with different type of units. So you see that I want to point out along State Street, we are up to up to State Street with the building on the second floor, and then when we go to the third floor similar footprint. We are also to the face of the building on the third floor. But as we move up the building, we begin to setback so although the zoning allows us to go to the fourth floor here and Brian had mentioned we have set back 30 feet. So that the building really reads as a three story building very consistent with what's happening with our neighboring buildings so that's an important setback you'll see more of that when we look at the design elements of the building exterior design elements. And really this this is a form based code for this so we are meeting all those, we are meeting those setbacks as we move back. So, after that, after the fourth floor then we go up to the fifth, sixth and I'm sorry the fifth, sixth and seventh floors are at this setback. And then similarly to the fourth floor then when we move back. The next floor we setback we're set we setback 100 and over 130 feet from State Street at this location we're providing a really incredible landscape roof garden on the seventh floor. I'll get into that a little bit further with landscape drawings but this is part of our green roof concept significant green roof areas, and many of them really part of the design of the building. So, we have the seventh, eighth and ninth floors, we then setback further on the ninth and the, and on the 10th floor so you see that in the design that element continues to setback. And then on top of the roof we have a roof terrace on this roof terrace important point here is that it is setback from all sides, so that it's really impossible to have any direct connection between the occupants, the people on the roof, and people on the street of the building so street around the building so there's a real visual separation of any kind from the people on the roof, and within the building. Moving to the design of the building so this is a rendering along State Street, and again you see the three story element of the building very consistent with the buildings that are surrounding us really along State Street on another side of the street, and we're also varying the design concept as it moves from one portion of the building to the other to emulate how these buildings break in size and scale so we feel that this is very important again. The second floor otherwise would be significantly higher that's where you would really feel the height of the building if it was on State Street so we feel like this has been, this is a very important element to us and we really went out of our way to make sure that we can make this work with restore elements along State Street and as they wrap around on to go around a view down go around again you see this, the third floor element, and then behind 30 feet behind this is the floors of four or five and six that setback further away from another important point is seeing our building, where we move up to this 10 stories, there's a lot of consistency and height with other buildings really surrounding us, and there's a really wonderful eclectic mix and Madison varying sizes of buildings and design, different type of design work that are really compatible with each other and we really just wanted to reinforce that feel with the design that we're proposing here. Here's a view along on along GORM and you're still you'll see on this rendering. We are maintaining 315 and 319 GORM these are existing buildings that the landmarks commission recommended that we restore and maintain as part of our designs so we took that and we have integrated those elements in our design, but really they're, you know, they work consistently as we move along to State Street, and also with the building elements that setback that are above them, but we feel like it's very important to have integrated these really lovely building within our building. Moving along on the Johnson also we've integrated the red rock building as part of this, and we've tried to create this kind of really a play of these heights, you know along the building on Johnson Street similar to what we've done on GORM so this is the red rock which will be reconstructed in this present location tying in with the other elements design elements and heights that we have within this building. Looking across Johnson this gives you a just a view of our building again the heights, very similar to surrounding buildings and you can see how we play with the masses of our building along with the existing buildings and really have them work in a very compatible way. This is a view looking back along Broome Street. And then really you can see the setback that we provided on the third floor how that plays in along state, and this gives you a good idea of how these this building really sits back significantly as we move back as we meet that form based zoning, but we also tie that into the expression of the architecture that we're proposing. You saw this a little bit earlier so this is the landscape that we have on the first floor I wanted to point out along State Street basically we don't touch State Street, existing trees remain as they are along Johnson existing trees also remain as they are, and then we'll be planting new trees along Gorm and on Broome areas where you don't see trees we've been working carefully with Department of Fire with forestry and engineering to really satisfy the requirements for each of these departments on fire requires fire access apparatus equipment to the building so we provided access for that based on the plant you're seeing here we satisfied the requirements of forestry based on existing trees and new trees and also for engineering, how we're providing various setbacks and access to the building so this is the important thing that we've been working very carefully carefully with those departments on as we move off up to the to the seventh floor, really the expression that we're looking at is we think of as a northern metal woodland expression, and it was really something that was championed by Midwestern landscape architects and we feel like we're, this was just an important space that we want to make special, and we have layered lightning stone in it. We have wonderful areas for people to find, find privacy and to, you know, sit and study or work or do whatever they want to do. Also a very important thing and I think we talked about this a lot in these kind of meetings we are also providing a dog run on this floor within the building so occupants would come in through this garden area to their, their dog run so people do not have to leave this building to go to the street with their dogs, we have access, have a spot in the building to provide, you know, for the dogs we think that we felt that that was a very important point to consider. Also wanted to point out that all the plant material that we will use here will be native plant material native grasses native shrubs native trees, really everything that's that's indigenous to the area will be used here. Then when we get up to the roof terrace, we have a pool area here and also another terrace open terrace area and we've really, again we're really trained to the landscape and really want to make this an important part of the building. And here you know we have we provided, you know centralness almost like this expression of tree Grove within the building, something that provides a visual separation between parts of the building, but also is, we just think a big important design characteristic. One last item I wanted to touch on with the building is from a sustainability standpoint this building will be designed to meet NG BS, that's national green building standard requirements national NG BS is the only green building rating that meets ANSI which is the American National standards Institute requirements. So this is, you know, sustainability in an important way we'll have significant green roof areas. In fact, I wanted to touch on some of the some of the green roof measures that we're considering. There would be green roof and And to control runoff for 100 years storm conditions. In addition to that we plan on having expanded green roof areas to further reduce the heat line heat island effect on the building, native plant materials as I mentioned before which cuts down on the irrigation water usage. This is a, as part of a sustainability measure this is built in but this is obviously a redevelopment of an existing infill site. We will have to reduce parking because of this being in a urban area, so we have less parking requirements than we would have otherwise. Where we do have the parking will have electric vehicle charging locations within the building, the building will have LED lighting throughout reducing light energy needs, energy, energy star appliances will reduce energy needs also we will provide low and zero VOC within the building to improve air quality. Reduce flow rate for shower heads faucets and toilets will be will be provided within the building. Windows that provide greater performance than required by the IDCC and construction waste and recycling plan will be incorporated into the building. So these are items that we are considering as part of our sustainability for the plan of this building. So, with that, thank you very much for inviting us to participate in this this evening. And with this, we'd like to take questions and take comments and thank you very much. Great. I'll jump in here. Again, Kevin Furko I'm with city planning staff and I will I guess serve as the MC for the Q&A portion of the meeting here this evening. So, Sydney went over a little while ago. Again, we'll use the raise hand feature for those who want to ask questions. Simply it's at the bottom of your screen if you hit reactions, and then from there you'll get a pop up menu and hit raise hand. What that'll do is put everybody in a queue, and what I will do is I will call people in the order that they show up in the queue here. I will do best with that I can with names if I mispronounce you and please correct me I want to make sure I get it right. So, also, Sydney and I are going to be checking your email so if people want to provide written comments. It's certainly also okay to do it that way and we can read the comments for you. So, a handful of that a handful of hands, and so we'll start up here. So first we'll start with Trevor Mackie to be followed by Larry Warman so Trevor Mackie I will turn the floor over to you. Thank you very much. Can you hear me. Yes. So my question is I overall I like the project it's really, they put a lot of work into it and I really enjoy it but how will this differentiate itself and other core spaces properties throughout the city such as the hub. Will there be will be the general layout I just don't want a lot of homogeny in the architecture in the area. I'm just curious about that. I can start this is, this is Marco housing with with core spaces. I can perhaps let us go discuss some of the architectural differences between this building and, and the rest that we've done in the area. I mean, first of all, you know we, when we work with with Antonovitch on these projects. A whole lot of thought goes into exactly what you what you mentioned which is avoiding homogeny avoiding repetition, you'll notice that no two core buildings really look alike. Even the hub and the James you know being essentially right next to one another. I guess they're both student housing buildings but architecturally I think that they're both pretty unique in their own ways. So, you know, generally, the materiality and the overall architecture and feel this building will be unique, clearly the step back lines and some of the zoning requirements requirements rather make for some pretty unique angles for instance you'll notice even in this view that I think that's kind of just kind of how, how nice it is that it, it, the angles in the zoning requirements sort of point you in the direction to the capital. I think this is a pretty, pretty neat image that that we've put together here just because it's short of it sort of shows the, you know, how well thought the the zoning code is with these these step backs at different distances off of state and how powerful, you know, in a nice way you know that that can be to be, you know, reverential to the capital and other landmarks in the city. Inside the building, you know, again, I'm not sure if any of you have have toured the hub or the James. Again, you'll notice that that on the inside they have a very distinct look and feel a very distinct kind of theme and. And this one would be the same. You know it wouldn't necessarily look or have any of the same design elements necessarily as the other two that we've previously done. This one I think is also unique in in sort of the streetscape experience. So, you know, we did a little puzzle, how you know how can we integrate these, these existing facades 100 year old facades into a building that's, you know, that's going to be built 100 years later. And the architects worked very hard to sort of make that work effectively. We did something similar on both the hub and the James, albeit to a much lesser scale I would say, if any of you are familiar, there were certain buildings that were on those sites that, you know, we, we did the same thing that we're proposing here. And in both of those cases it turned out really nicely. Here I think it's going to be even more sort of a point of distinction because these are pretty well known you know facades as you're walking up and down, especially Gorham Street there, and just the kind of the juxtaposition of the, the old versus the new. I think it's just the opportunity to have so much great retail frontage on this one, you know, I think this one, presumably has, you know, the most visible location of the three that we've done. And as a result, you know we paid extra special attention to what is that streetscape experience like. And so, again, a lot of a lot of thought was put into that. I mean, you know, I could go on further I will say that you know inside the building the units, you know, they're similar, similar levels of quality and finish. Obviously, this will deliver, you know, half a decade after the last two at least and so there have obviously been some, some changes in how core designs units and how they you know we do our finishes and our amenity spaces and stuff. So, we're pretty confident that this building will really fit into the surroundings and will not just read as hub to or the James part two and really be a distinct, you know, building in the neighborhood. Thank you guys did a good job. Thank you. Okay, thanks. Next, Larry Warman to be followed by Carly Forsythe. Larry Warman, the floor is yours. I'm not sure if this question is for Kevin or the developers or maybe both. There was talk about providing qualified student housing I guess through some kind of financial aid agreement with the university what can the city and the developers do to provide a similar situation for the employees who work downtown who don't make a lot of money at some of the retail establishments but who certainly need a place to live in the downtown areas anything we can do to make sure the housing at this project is quote unquote affordable for them. I mean that that's a very good point. We, we've, again, put a lot of thought into this had, you know, many, many calls with with Sydney and the planning staff and with the economic development staff and with the university and, you know, we it's important to us that this is a component of this project. We, we kind of shifted our strategy a couple of times over the last couple of months in terms of how we were going to approach it. And we're still I would say, still at the kind of the, the, the start of those conversations in a lot of ways because they're you know we're still working out a lot of details with with the university and with the city in terms of how this is going to work. So we decided that the focus would be on student afford or sorry affordable student housing, obviously knowing the need for affordable non student workforce housing, and you know combined with the fact that this is at the 300 block of State Street is, you know, in a part of town, albeit close to the university that will likely attract people, you know, not affiliated with the university, more so than the hub which is right at the you know the front, front door of the university so Well, I don't have a definitive answer on on exactly how we're going to cross every T, as we're going through this process. I appreciate the feedback that that you know you think there's still a need for affordable non student housing as well. Sorry, yes, affordable, affordable non student housing in this location as well. And we will certainly you know layer that into our conversations moving forward with with city staff. But it's still very much a work a work in progress in terms of how we're how we're going to tackle the affordability component of the project. Kevin, can you address that quickly or not. Well, I could speak to it. Generally, as far as some of the limitations I guess I would start there and answering the question. As you may know, the city doesn't have the ability from a regulatory standpoint to set rents that would be inconsistent with with state law. So the, what the city could do is provide some sort of incentives in work with with development team but as part of the zoning approval or a conditional use approval. The city couldn't say x number of units needed to be set at a certain rent level. I don't know if that gets at your question. Well, and that's a prolong this but you know, the city does provide shelters for people who are supposedly homeless and they're spending money in that direction so I don't understand why they couldn't focus some money towards this project that's all I'm asking. There is the city's affordable housing fund and again I don't know if any of those discussions with the development team have been there in terms of where the city provides funding I don't know if this or some of the other programs are still I think that would be a very good next step. Well, and Kevin I can layer into that and that we have had a lot of lengthy conversations with all the departments that look at housing supply and affordability. And this is a case where the project is not requesting city assistance, but is yet providing affordability and while the project won't be able to solve for the issues we recognize that's much larger than than what's at play here. We do think that in conversation that there is an opportunity to deliver on again something that hasn't really been focused on and that is that that affordable student housing project. And so that's where the direction had gone. Again, as this is largely a student housing projects while we certainly will not and cannot and absolutely would not discriminate against anyone in terms of fair housing. We anticipate most of the residents of the building being largely students and as such, while there may be some market rate housing incorporated into it and folks that find find housing here. The approach to the affordability issues of downtown that we're trying to address within this project is focused more at the student housing end of it. And that's where, again, that that extra height is a component of creating the mechanism to help make that happen without any direct subsidy from the city or through TIF assistance. There aren't any other problems on that. Our next question or comment is from Carly Forsyth to be followed by Lori Gravante. Carly Forsyth. Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Wonderful. And I give you credit for being able to pronounce my name. It is not commonly. Yeah, that's not something I hear very often. So two questions slash comments and my apologies in advance because I am one of the neighborhood residents who's not in favor of this project. And I mean, no offense to developers, no offense to anyone who's spoken tonight. I have no doubt that you have been working hard on this project. I first I do want to raise the issue of some of the wording. There is it was mentioned, you know, there is student housing and then there are units of affordable student housing that it really makes me wonder why that adjective is used at all. Either this is affordable student housing for everyone and should be treated as such or it frankly singling out some of the units as affordable student housing. At least that's that's how it was written in the notice that I got where I found out about this meeting in the first place. It smacks of either. This will be the only the only affordable set of units within a larger, a larger community that is so high priced that no one will be able to afford them or it's max of poorly maintained. Why the double standard at all. Either treat everything as affordable and cost as such or don't use the adjective at all. And my second point I do want to raise is the question of neighborhood cohesion or lack thereof. Yes, there is a student housing issue in downtown. Certainly there's more housing needed. But at the same time, can you please speak to the destruction of neighborhood cohesion we are losing at least two neighborhood mainstays that are vital for a community that's already fairly transient people moving in and out. Yes. Do we really need this to be, do we really need yet another reason for people to move in and out as soon as they're, as soon as they're, whatever stint at the university is up. Do we really there. I'm very concerned that there isn't going to be much in the way of a neighborhood left and call me old school if you knew my age I'm not disclosing my age, but there really isn't going to be much of a neighborhood left if all the businesses are are driven out by more and more housing projects and yes there is business space beneath, but I do wonder, you know, is that going to be trendy businesses moving in and out, where neighborhood necessities are no longer in place. Can you speak to can book to both of those questions. Yeah, I can speak to the affordable housing component and this is really something that we use to differentiate between effectively units that would be delivered at market rate, and that's what a majority of the units would be would be competitive with the other housing that's available for students within the general market, and there's going to be a wide range within that. And then we also recognize that even the market that is out there today that there are students of need who have financial burdens that that cannot or that would result in significant housing burden to just to meet market rates within the city. So what we're interested in doing is identifying opportunities and partnering with this, the university to identify, perhaps through students who have already qualified for needs based grants and deliver housing at a significant discount that matches up with what they can afford to pay so they can find housing within the campus area and give give that as a component of this building. Again, we're looking around roughly 10% of the units within this would be in that program. And it's something we're working closely with city staff and the university to try to identify what that price point is so that you have students who are receiving financial aid to attend the university. We want to try to give them housing aid in terms of matching what they can afford to pay for their housing while they attend campus so that's the differential we use that to try to define what that component is and it's something we're in conversation with the city staff on significantly. As far as the existing businesses and the ability to track businesses back, we do recognize that there's displacements that are happening. It's something that the current landowners have worked very closely with all those businesses, try to resolve in manners that meet the needs of those, those businesses. It's been something that's been discussed at length for quite some time, not just under the context of this project. But it is something that that we understand we have reached out to some of those existing businesses and hope there's an opportunity to bring them back. But then the design of the retail spaces on that first floor really is focused at creating opportunities for more businesses to come back and support the surrounding neighborhood and community. As I mentioned, one of those pieces being an incubator space, whereas residents of the building, just people that live in the neighborhood that are looking for assistance in either forming a new business or they have an idea for a business. It's a support structure to help launch some of those businesses and incubate businesses that support the neighborhood and the residents of the overall community. So we're excited about the opportunity to bring additional retail back. We recognize there's displacements in the near term. But feel that the overall opportunity here is to really continue that vibrancy on State Street and down Gorham and down to Broome and really create a streetscape that supports the businesses and community moving forward. And in fact, we're essentially underwriting a significant portion of the retail in this building. Again, we talk about affordable residential. We're also setting aside score footage of retail, what I'll call affordable retail. We know what the market rate is for lease on State Street. We also know that a lot of these smaller locally owned mom and pop businesses can't necessarily afford that market rent on State Street. And so we are fully prepared to set aside a portion of this building. In an ideal world, a room of one's own and community pharmacy do so well in their new locations that they say we need to come back downtown. And we are actually preparing conversations with both of those tenants and other tenants that are currently on the site to see what it would take to bring them back in a few years when this building delivers. We obviously see the value of these long term legacy tenants and what they mean to the community. And I would be extremely happy if at the end of the day, this row on Gorham that we're looking at here had chasers, a room of one's own and community pharmacy all back. And we're prepared to make concessions to offer them below market rents to help make that happen, knowing how important that is to the neighborhood and the long term viability of the neighborhood, not just for students that might be there for a few years, but also for the long term residents like many of you on the call here. Okay, there's not anything else on that one. The other follow ups on that one. Otherwise, our next speaker is Lori Grappintine to be followed by Jeffrey Wills. Lori Grappintine. Hi, thank you very much to the developers for their time tonight. It's always great for us to be able to see a lot of detail and have feedback, especially when we're talking about the new buildings. I'm always happy to be able to see a lot of detail and have feedback, especially this early in the stage of a project. So I really appreciate that and I appreciate seeing all the renderings as well. I have a question about the facades. So when the hub was just about finished being completed or maybe close to the end, I had some out of town residents, out of town guests in town. I had a long Francis in University looking up at the building, and they had been here before and they said, Oh my gosh, look at that building. Are they going to finish that and I said, they were looking at the exposed concrete side of the basically back of the hub towers, and I said, Oh, you guys don't worry the city would never let them leave those facades looking like that. That was wrong. So I would just like to hear some assurances that all the facades of this new building will be actually finished rather than left as exposed concrete. I'll take that one. That was part of the expression of that building in those concrete elements kind of rotated around the building. So that was part of the aesthetic there. That is not part of the aesthetic in this building. What you see primarily is masonry and then corrugated metal panel systems that we like the play of the machine element against the stuff software character of the brick so in this rendering that you see on the screen If you're looking at it, the reddish brick elements, the reddish areas or brown areas are brick elements and the darker ones are this corrugated type of metal system. Again, we think that it's a really nice contrast of those two types of materials so and you saw around the other portions of the building primarily masonry, along with this. So different aesthetic. Than what you saw on the hub. Yes. And this building, I'd say less much more so than the hub or the James doesn't have a back to it really. I mean, you'll notice that you know all sides are treated slightly differently. But there's no you know even what would be you know perhaps the back Johnson Street is still a very busy thoroughfare so you know we were not treating any any side of this as the backside of this building. It's all the front side to someone that lives across the street from him. Great. Thank you. Okay. Let's see our next speaker is Jeffrey wills to be followed by Ryan Luca, Jeffrey. Thank you very much. I have one question for developers and then one question for the city staff. Could you all show us the, you know, an angle from the south side from the broom and Johnson corner. Yeah, so you were saying that there's no backside but I guess I, I'm, you know, trying to understand here. You know, you're very respectful to the architecture on State Street, but to the firehouse here. I'm just not seeing the step back. And in fact, if I understand you asking for extra height. Next to it. This this year's tower that builds up goes right to the property line. So I guess my question would be, you know, is there some way in which you have thought about treating this side also with step backs next to a historic building. Jeffrey, I'd like to point out and it's misleading in this rendering but because the firehouse building sets about 10 feet from the street. There was actually a separation of 10 feet between our building above the first floor, and then the portion of the building that rides above so that does, there is a separation there and I wish it showed up better here but this is just the way it reads. And I think that's what's in this rendering where it does seem like they are building sits right on top of it but in fact, again the portion of the building that rises up is set back away from the building, and then the aesthetic of that element next to it we carried that brick element really to play, you know play against the character of the color and design of the firehouse building. And then you know the way we saw that that element played up and down. And so I think that's the way we should treat that line, you know in the two or three story high level. Yes, I mean I know I see what you've done I guess I would say in the end it still feels like it makes the fireplace, firehouse look out of place. And that's, that's not quite, you know, I know the way I think you know we should treat that. And so maybe everybody can I give you just one, just respond one point to that I think, you know, if you look around this town and really surrounding this you see a lot of variation in height you'll see lower buildings against higher buildings and it really takes place everywhere and that's part of, you know, this being a town that was built over a long period of time. And so the only time that was maybe when there was different sources owning but you really do see a lot of variation, not only in design but on scale of buildings and we felt that you know some of these elements take place here really the form based zoning that makes up this development is based on that taking place that there's a variation in height, even within a building to play against the ones around it. And so for example across the street the capital center where it has, you know, two story townhouses that then step back significantly before there's a big tower. And so you know the opposite corner to this firehouse is actually at almost the same scale as the firehouse. And so it does seem to me that it's not quite matching that side the other side of the street there, what you're proposing. So the idea is about the density in general. So, you know, we have a downtown plan which, you know, calls for amenities for residents, which includes parks and we in the seven or whatever years number of years since we passed the downtown plan. We're going to have as far as I know bought zero square feet of parkland in this area, contrary to the to the plan and so the idea that we're going to have, you know, extra density developers have their rights but the idea that we would have above zone density extras, when we have not provided the adequate amenities for residents already existing in the neighborhood strikes me as very strange. So my question is, can you know what what can we do as a city to make sure that these kind of proposals, very interesting proposals would be possible because at present, you know, it doesn't seem to me that we have the, the amenities for the for the existing residents, much less above above zoning ones. My quick response to that would be over the last several years there have been efforts that parks and real estate staff have been looking to identify those sites they have not been able to secure one, I will admit I have not been in, you know, those discussions. Personally, and I don't know if older revere has any updates or insight I know that is, it has been a recommendation of the downtown plan and other documents, and no efforts have been to do that to find downtown park space. Sorry to put you on this. Oh, is there some way in which we can say that we first that we will only allow, you know, excess square footage. After we have, you know, provided parks because otherwise, we're making the real estate more and more expensive and the, you know, it's not clear to me that every time the parks, you know recommends a site that the owners of it say no so I understand the pious intentions the city but we are we are failing. I'll jump in here and thank you for the excellent question Jeffrey. As you know, because we talked about this issue regularly at our monthly Mifflin neighborhood meetings. By the way, those of you that aren't aware the Mifflin district of capital neighborhoods meets the first Wednesday of every month at 6pm. Currently on zoom during the pandemic, we would love to see some new faces at those meetings if possible. With that said, for those that haven't heard heard an update from me in those meetings, and just as a reminder for those of you that do attend those meetings pretty regularly. The city has for many years now budgeted millions of dollars in our parkland acquisition fund to purchase additional land in this immediate neighborhood for a new downtown park. So it's not for a lack of trying or lack of available funds that we don't have a new downtown park yet. It is absolutely the most park efficient part of the city, given that tremendously high densities that exist in this neighborhood. The development that we are discussing tonight, if indeed it is approved and built will be paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional park fees to the city for the, for the benefit of building this proposal and not providing adequate parkland for the residents of this new development. So, so there will be even more money available to us. I had a conversation with the mayor, only a couple of hours ago, and this was among the topics we talked about. She is well aware that I am the neighborhood collectively very much want this to be more of a priority. We were talking about the next year's budgeting already and she assured me that the money would continue to be in her proposed budget for 2022. So the money isn't the issue. The issue is having willing property owners that will sell parcels that are acceptable to the city's landscape architects or park staff. So we have had several attempts and sadly failures at securing property that our landscape architects and city planners thought were optimal sites. Unfortunately, those property owners were not willing to sell. Some of you recall we even went to eminent domain that is condemnation on some of those parcels specifically these were on West Mifflin Street and those efforts failed as well. So I realize that we have not done well in this. I assure each and every one of you that we need to make this more of an effort on our part. The city does still plan to upgrade the current senior center courtyard to a full scale city park in the coming year. We are just waiting to begin that process of public engagement on that proposal that was halted due to the pandemic. So I know this probably isn't a good response. So I know this probably isn't a good response. Jeffrey, you've heard it all from me before. But your point is absolutely well taken. I wish we had willing owners that would sell us parcels that are deemed acceptable and optimal for the parks experts. We just haven't had that success yet. But we will not stop trying to make this work and provide desperately need additional park space and open space for the residents of this neighborhood, both current residents and future residents. So thank you and I hope that the planning staff can maybe talk to those park and landscape experts and explain the urgent state of the issue. A couple things that we can address through this project, of course, is as you saw the designs through the creation of the green roof systems that are within this go well above and beyond what the quote unquote open space requirements would be for this project on terms of active space. We have both the top floor deck as well as the seventh floor roof so that we have a variety of different spaces in support of the residents of this building, again exceeding what would be required. The other aspect of that is getting to, as Mike said, in terms of funds available to purchase, this will develop this development will contribute significant park fees to the tune of almost $2 million worth of park fees potentially. So while it doesn't address the site itself, it does create some opportunities through development that could support acquisition of other sites. Thanks. Next, we have Ryan Luca to be followed by Ronald Luskin. Ryan Luca. Yes, thank you. I appreciate the presentation today and I really like the proposal I just wanted to raise one concern, and that was with the affordability of the apartments that are there. Now you said that the rent is calculated based on the market rent, but with core spaces owning a number of developments, it would be a substantial portion of that, the housing and available apartments are owned and would be priced by core spaces. Can you kind of address how this is not going to make the rental rates, less affordable for students, and how you're going to keep this affordable among and across all the projects. Well, slight correction core does not currently own any buildings in Madison, this would be the only building I mean we have in the past but at this time, we do not own any buildings in Madison. So it's, you know, it's not. So it's still a very competitive market you know obviously with the simple laws of supply and demand adding 1100 more beds helps equalize things and keep the rates competitive amongst all the properties. No one wants to be the, the guy that's charging $100 more a month than the rest. So just wanted to clarify that we no longer own the hub or the James. So our rate setting would be you know, have to be competitive with them it wouldn't be some kind of a cartel or anything like that we we need to compete and keep our rates as low as possible in order to to lease up against the hub and the James which are now, you know, would be the competitors of this building. There's not, are there any follow ups on that one. And if not, then, Ronald musk and you're next in the queue to be followed by neat mole. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate your, your time tonight. I'd like to be in favor of this project, and because generally I believe in in urban renewal. I just want to be clear though my understanding is that there's kind of a quid pro quo that you're looking to have some additional height for the project. And that comes with the opportunity to offer affordable housing. Is that correct. Correct affordable housing, affordable retail, you know, lower height along State Street the most, you know, arguably the most important right but but affordable housing is kind of the key thing that you've talked about. It is. Yeah, it is a key. And so tonight, tonight you talked about, there would be 10% of the units would be units that would be affordable student housing. That's what I think Mr Monson said earlier. That's correct. And so, but I'm troubled by them is I was in a. Another meeting this morning a public meeting where I asked about the portable housing component. And this morning, you told a different story. You didn't talk about there being 10% of the units. No yeah it's bad. Yeah, in student housing it's obviously everything is sorry. Excuse me. You talked about a different concept you talked about the affordability would be just spread across the entire complex that there would be no differentiation by virtue of units. So I'm troubled by the fact that we talked about it, one way in the morning when the way in the evening. And I think that was still preliminary. You need to figure out what's your. What, what, what, what, what, which one. If I could clarify, because it creates a problem perhaps of trust. Well, let me let me clarify that, because we're using some round numbers right now in terms of number of units but to explain to the rest of the group that wasn't on the call this morning, the approach that we're contemplating trying to do in this project is actually divorce the distill it down to beds, so that we have a set number of beds that will be available for any student who qualifies, and that those beds wouldn't be tied to a specific unit so that you'd say well, you have to take this three bedroom on this floor because that's the affordable unit. Rather what we're trying to do is get to a mechanism where we would have qualified a pool of qualified applicants, we'd have a pool of qualified beds, those applicants could then, in effect, go into any unit anywhere within the building. They could find roommates that maybe are not qualified for the assistance program, and but yet they would be able to select any unit, rather than say, well, I've got to go find three other roommates who meet the qualifications because we all have to qualify to meet this specific unit. What we're trying to do is create an opportunity where the students will lead, this building will be leased by the bed rather than by the unit, but whether we define that as a certain number of beds or a certain number of units, the goal is to really have roughly 10% of those available for students of needs that would qualify through potentially a partnership with the university, and then they could select their roommates, they could select their unit, but they would get the subsidy or a write down on their rents that would allow them to be able to meet their housing needs based on their income needs. So it's the same dialogue. It's not, we didn't quite go into as much detail tonight. Apologize for that. There certainly will be a lot more dialogue in the application that describes all of this as we get closer. But our goal really is to give an opportunity to have affordable units within the building available for students who are of need, and the challenge is a little bit of the how do you qualify a student. If you think back to when most of us were students, you know, there's a point in time where an income qualification doesn't necessarily reflect need. So what we're in conversation with the university about is, are there grant programs where they're already receiving assistance through the university that we could lean on and say, well, this is a good proxy for a qualification of needs. So if they qualify and meet the needs to get the grants, they would also qualify potentially to get the assistance here on a rent write down. So our goal is to distribute them throughout the building to allow them to have access to all the same amenities. We want these students to be indistinguishable from everyone else. We simply see them as residents, but residents that have a need for some additional assistance on their housing. So we're excited to work with the university and with the city to flesh out what that program means. But again, our goal is to scatter them throughout the building, give them options to who they want to rent with, give them options where in the building they want to rent, and really focus in on how can we help them overcome some of the financial burdens of finding housing within downtown. So thank you for your, for your clarification, but I think you need to be consistent how you describe it. And I think that why you said you need to flush things out, there needs to come a point in time where this needs to be codified codified. So that if that's the quid pro quo, you want to offer affordable housing for the opportunity for more floors, more height. And I think that's what, what the needs to be a point in the road where that happens. Absolutely, totally agree. And actually that is where the pre application is to sound out some of these ideas. But when we get to the application, that's when it absolutely the rubber hits the road that's where it has to be spelled out. There will be continued dialogue about some of the components that go forward, but certainly the the details that you see tonight will be magnified immensely in the application itself, which has to touch on a whole host of additional items and give some concrete answers, because it's not just a five minute description, it has to be exactly what do we want to build, how are we going to operate it, and what's being requested of the day. What's being requested of the city in terms of the zoning approval. So this is anticipated to go through a plan unit development process, which is Sydney pointed out at the start of the meeting is a much more detailed process that will have a lot of public meetings. But I would absolutely agree with you that part of that process is to get to the specifics so that people can make decisions based off of what's being proposed in concrete fashion, so that you have a set point. Unfortunately, tonight, we're not quite to that set point, we will be getting there. And again, as we move towards a formal submittal, there will be a lot more information shared in that application so people can take a look at. Thank you very much. I look forward to following the progress of the project. Thanks. And just to note, we do have quite a few hands in the queue. So I'm going to next move to Nate mole to be followed by Elizabeth McDonald. So, Nate mole, you're up next. Thanks for taking my question. I have two, one for Brian and one for Mark. My first for Brian. You talk about working with the university a lot and I'm curious. Have you initiated these conversations with the university already. And if so, what offices with the university had you been working with. Yes, we have. We've had some conversations with the Office of Financial Assistance as a point of contact that was recommended through the city. We've also had detail on that call representative strong the city. So it is something that we are working to to advance that partnership and that opportunity. I think there's a great, you know, some excitement on both sides as this could fit some needs. But it is absolutely a conversation that has begun and will hopefully be able to share more information about it as we proceed forward. All right, thank you. And my next question is for Mark. Mark, you mentioned earlier that core does not own any buildings in Madison currently. However, core has developed or initiated to buildings that are in Madison downtown. That's correct. I'm just looking at both the hub and the James. You said that no one wants to be the guy who charges $100 more than the other. I just looked tonight and a studio at the hub currently rents for $1,430. And a person making $15 an hour, which is the aspirational minimum wage for a person making $15 an hour, their monthly rent would make up 55% of their income. Yet I would maybe, you know, assume that like a studio would be the most affordable place where a person could live. So looking forward to this new development. Again, the talk about affordability. I just don't understand how that how that works out. Myself. You know, I'm a I'm approaching 10 years as a university employee. I live downtown. You can hear the ambulance passing by on Horham Street. I live in the shadow of this building. And as a 10 year almost 10 year employee of the university living in a studio at the hub would make up more than 40% of my monthly income. And every financial advisor says rent should not make up more than 33% of your income. What about this new building makes it affordable? Because even as almost a 10 year employee of the university, this is not affordable to me. So what makes it affordable to students? Well, or or myself, who is part of your target demographic. Sure, of course. Studio is actually the most expensive unit in these buildings because you're living by yourself. Just to clarify. So, you know, when we say that we approve that we offer, you know, a wide range by by offering everything from a micro up to a five bedroom, you know, the, if you go on the hub website or the James website or any number of websites, you'll see, you know, a pretty wide range of rents. But yeah, so the studio being fourteen hundred dollars at the hub is that's not the cheapest building or unit in the building. That's the most expensive one, you know, since we rent by the bed. So I completely understand the affordability concerns. I think, you know, we're we're doing what we can to provide a sizable portion of this building that are truly affordable units to those that qualify for them. You know, outside of those units, we we provide units where there's double occupancy bedrooms. We provide units that are not necessarily one bath for each bedroom. There's likely going to be, you know, upwards of 40 different unit types in this building, all of which have different rents. And and as you can see, if you look at the hubs website and what they're currently advertising, it's a pretty wide range between living in a studio, the most expensive unit to living with three roommates, which we find is how a lot of a lot of our target demographic prefers to live with their friends. Sure. I do have a follow up question for you with the hub one, the hub. The hub. Lori mentioned earlier that there were less than aesthetically pleasing aspects of the hub, you mentioned yourself that the hub has a back to it. Will the hub or as you cast it off on another development or landlord once like will that current property owner do anything to remedy the fact that we have 12 or 13 floors and two faces that are just raw concrete facing one of the busiest streets downtown? I unfortunately can't speak to what what the other owner will do again to Jeff's point that he made earlier. I think that the raw concrete was a specific architectural choice that, you know, when that project was approved, it went through the design review board. I went through planning commission. This was shown to people. It was a specific type of architecture. This, as you can see from the picture we're looking at is a different type of architecture. So I can't speak to what the current owners of the hub might do to change the facade of that building. But I, you know, I personally think that the renderings we're looking at, you know, speak for themselves. And obviously they're a work in progress and will continue to go before the urban design commission and continue to get neighbor feedback and UDC feedback to, you know, present a building that people like. So, yeah. Yeah, I don't mean to put you in the spot, but I appreciate your answers. Thank you. Great. Next we have Elizabeth McDonald to be followed by Carly Forsythe. Elizabeth McDonald, you're up next. Hi, so a few things. From the outset, I'd just like to say that as a 26 year old young professional. I'm incredibly alarmed at the lack of social and economic diversity that this project will engender. I can assure the developers that no one outside of college age is going, myself included, will want to live in a student building. So my concern is what will be done to attract young professionals like me. I was drawn to Madison from the East Coast for the university, but I stayed for the character and lifestyle of the city. And in the seven years I've lived here, you know, I've, I've observed at least 15 different projects of this caliber in Madison alone, not to mention the suburbs. So I'd like to know a couple things. How do you plan to account for market oversaturation? My building is half empty. The building across the street from me, I'm on Johnson, is half empty. So how do you plan to account for that? And then additionally, you know, what about traffic and how much this will strain the infrastructure of the neighborhood? What will be done to mitigate the impact this building will have on local services such as fire and sewage, as well as police and other city services? Well, I guess I could start with the traffic comment on the back end. We have been in conversation with the fire department, with all the various departments up at the city to evaluate any needs from the service standpoint and to date have received fairly, In essence that the support structure is there for this type of development. This is very much the density that was anticipated on this site and within the plans that are adopted the comprehensive plan. From a traffic sense, we've talked very closely with traffic engineering, and they're comfortable with where both the access is being provided and the amount of parking that's being provided for this project. And I would note that you were very cognizant of trying to balance that. You see a very large portion of bike parking because we do see this as an opportunity to have a majority of our residents utilize mass transit, walking, biking to access the community. And so that's why you see bike parking rooms and guest bike parking rooms that are right off the sidewalks that are accessible and easily used by residents and guests in support of this project. But also things like what you can't see in these plans that you know, core typically will offer a fleet of electric bikes available for residents that will be, you know, just looking at things like as Jeff mentioned, you know, placing stalls for Uber pickup and drop offs for food as well as for passengers. Really part of that component of the day to day operations of the building to try to really encourage residents to use multimodal transportation as much as possible. It is something that we're looking very closely at in terms of trip generation. But as I said, in conversation with the other departments, they don't see any any issues in terms of the infrastructure that's in place to serve this project that wouldn't be solvable by the build up of the project. Brian, as a quick follow up to that, just to did traffic require any sort of traffic study as they do with some proposals? Curious if that was any supplemental work that you'd be doing? No, they did recommend that we do some transportation modeling, which we looking at trip generation, which is something we're doing as part of the application. We're going through the checklist for transportation demand management just to see if there are techniques that we would want to integrate in here to make things, you know, again, with their focus towards multimodal transportation. But they're not requiring a full transportation demand management for this project, as they saw the abutting arterial street system in place with ample service for this project. Okay, somebody on the development team want to respond to the other questions that had to do with market saturation? I'm not sure if that would be Mark or? Yeah, I mean, I can't I mean, you know, I guess at the end of the day, if, if, if core believed that there was truly a market saturation, we, we wouldn't be prepared to spend as, you know, all this time and effort to to build this building here, we do significant market research, you know, when we're looking at markets and looking at sites, and we strongly believe that there's, there's still a strong market for our product type in Madison. We've got good research to back that up. When you look at occupancies and, and, you know, rent trends and things like that. So I guess to, you know, the short answer is, you know, we don't believe that there's market saturation in Madison for this product type. So I guess my follow up question would be in regards to the traffic pattern. I'm an avid cyclist and it's I know several of my peers in my building are and you, you told the bike storage and the bike parking. What will you do if you're not doing a traffic study about the safety of the residents and, you know, there's, there's hardly any lighting and a building of the size is going to increase the amount of pedestrians as well as the number of cyclists and Johnson isn't a well, well lit streets. So how will you, how, how are you going? How can you account for the number of cyclists and the increased amount of traffic if you aren't doing a traffic study? Well, we are doing a trip generation study, which looks at the trips generated coming in and out of the building. And as far as the infrastructure that's around us, as you mentioned, you know, Johnson does have the bike lane that's immediately adjacent to our, to our site. That would remain. We are expanding the sidewalks all around the site with the exception of State Street because State Street already has an expanded sidewalk, but both all three other frontages of Johnson, Broom and Gorham will have a wider sidewalks with more opportunities for pedestrian movement than is currently there. And so we are looking at it very closely as for how the design of the building works in terms of how residents will access not just vehicular parking, but come in and out of the lobby, have direct access to the two different bike parking areas off the street level, where they have long-term bike storage further in the building. You know, those are all elements as we move forward, there'll be much more details incorporated into the application to address that. But we are looking at, you know, how people come and go from the site in all modes and making sure that we work very closely with the city to make an environment that's safe for our residents and for the community. And that again, is part of why we go through the approval process because you don't have to take our word for it. It really also gets a second check with the professional staff and the various departments that will look at each of these components in micro detail as part of the review of any project. And that's really, you know, part of that process is that double check to make sure that if there's a technique or an improvement that's needed, little things that they want to mirror, looking at vision triangles, looking at sidewalk widths, curb types, all of that gets vetted out as part of that application process. And it's something that then comes together for the final approval. And even with the final approval, I can tell you that a building like this will often have many, many conditions of approval. So even after it's approved, there will be details that staff will be looking for. They will be looking for specific design details or evaluation of movement so that even before, even after the approval and before a permit is issued, they go through it one more time and make sure that all of those conditions of approval are met and that all of the resulting infrastructure is in place that will support the building when it eventually gets built. There aren't any more follow ups on that one. A couple more hands in the queue. Carly Forsyth, you're next to be followed by Linda Scott. Hello, can you hear me? Hello. Yes. Oh, sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. I am jumping again. And I would apologize for being that nitpicking person, but I am that person when it comes to wording. I'm still going to take issue with the phrase affordable student housing, affordable housing versus not. You speak of and I mean, no offense, but you speak of wanting to include students of more limited means and people of more limited means wherever and however you can in this current project. And yet that phrasing speaks of a nasty connotation. There is a nasty connotation and a really a two tiered system of residency there. Call it needs based student housing if you must, but might I suggest a change of wording because that truly it does create something of a second class status for those moving in. Whether whether it's known who has the quote unquote affordable apartment and who doesn't the connotation is there and it's it's not a pretty one. It's I could get into a whole lot of other details, but probably shouldn't. But I might I suggest a copy editor there. Well, it certainly is a needs based program. That's that is what we're looking at is trying to identify students who have housing burden. Why not phrase it that way an opportunity to then address some of that through direct assistance through the through a program in partnership potentially with the city and the university. And the university and that's why that's really what it gets at. Why not phrase it that way. It's certainly more honest that way and less of a nasty connotation. Well, no connotation intended simply as a way to describe it. It is a needs based program. The challenges that we're going to be looking at are going to be how to make sure that that the applicants qualify and that we're getting that assistance to the students that that have that need. You know, one of the standard approaches for affordable housing delivery is an income based test, which doesn't quite apply to students. And so that's where the opportunity to potentially look at a grant program pre qualification could address some of that. And again, it is getting very much at a needs basis and trying to find a way so that they are, in essence, indistinguishable from any other tenant within the building. Of course, my question is why not call it needs based straight out in the literature and affordable. There is a connotation there, whether it's intended or not. Yeah, appreciate that. Sorry, if there's nothing else on that one, Linda Scott, you are next in the queue. Thank you. I'm concerned about the height of the building at the corner of Gorman broom and actually this perspective is exactly what kind of triggered that. I know you're asking for extra height in this building, which makes it even worse in my mind. I know the buildings across Gorham from your project are very low because they're within the State Street corridor. So I think they're limited to the maximum of four stories back there. And then on broom. I am struggling with your perspective. Are we looking down broom here looking to the south broom here and this perspective off to the right of your. Yes, that's correct. I'm seeing tall buildings along broom and I don't believe any building has frontage. I mean, I think I'll step back off room. Yeah, that that is an error and that is something that as we're working through the modeling will be refined the cap center building there is actually is 13 stories, but you are correct in that it does step down as it approaches broom through a series of different steps in that in that building. Yeah, as does metropolitan. So this is really misleading, because it makes it look like oh it's just another tall building along broom. But in fact, the opposite side of broom I think that's zone. I don't think anything's over is it the stories or six stories along broom across the street from it. And there are no other tall buildings along broom on the side year on so I mean this would really stand out like a sore thumb in that neighborhood, all the buildings around that intersection and looking down broom are not going to be of this scale at all. So I think it really does not fit well. Well, if I could clarify what you see here along broom of course the houses across the street or in that one to two story building range, the plans in the comprehensive plan calls for up to six. The domain frontage, which is the building across the street there at the corner of Johnson and and broom. Southeast corner is six stories then steps up to 12 in the foreground is the equinox which is 12 stories. The cap center building along broom is actually eight stories along broom, and then steps back through two or three steps to significantly more and I'm trying to count those but I believe it's, it's eight, 12 to 16. So from the standpoint of how that building steps that rendering needs to be adjusted but it is accurate in terms of the overall height of that building there along broom street and Dayton across the street on gore you're correct in that we have three, roughly two to three to three and a half story buildings depending on how you determine the parapets of those buildings but again those are what are shown in the foreground of this behind the building is the ovation building which goes from six stories to eight stories to 12 stories with a mechanical penthouse up to 13 stories. And that's what's shown behind the building in this view. I guess my concern is the on broom, all those buildings are stepping back there. None have that night up right along. Well actually the cap center building which does have a setback from broom street which is what's accurately portrayed portrayed here does go up to eight stories in that first step back. I agree with that, that tickle but it is it is stepped more than yours. Correct and that will be corrected that that is something that we noted this morning, as we're developing the renderings for tonight's meeting, and that'll be corrected in the packet moving forward. I don't think this gets decided in a, in a neighborhood presentation you'll have to go through urban design and you have to go through planning, you know, and their, their charges to look at. Does this meet does this not meet. I don't think tonight's the time to debate how high one side of this project should be. I just wanted to make that comment. Thank you. Thank you both for your comments. I'm looking. I don't see any other hands on the queue and I know we're approaching nine o'clock. And so I don't know maybe. Well first I should check in. Sydney was going to be looking to see if there is any email questions. And while we do the last call for comments or questions Sydney did you have any questions that have come into the email I don't have any in my inbox. I received one comment more so than question to remain anonymous and I'll just read it for the group. I feel the city should consider adding the inner city bus terminal to this project as it offers the buses larger and better streets to navigate in the downtown, rather than trying to jam it into a ready congested area where they would have to deal with ramp patrons event crowds and the majority of the general population in this area not utilizing these buses. So, that is, I appreciate that comment if you're still on the call I don't know if that directly relates to this project is it'll soon be an active proposal but it's a good thing to note. And second of all I got an email about people interested in joining the steering committee so while I have the floor I will just read those two email addresses for in the case people want to get involved so first is for Tim camps, and his email is TK.KAMPS at gmail.com. And then the second email is a mall Goyal and his email is a G O Y a L eight at whisk.edu again that's a G O Y a L eight at whisk.edu so feel free to email Tim or a mall and they'll get you on that neighborhood steering committee. But, Kevin that's all I have for now and I'll raise my hand if anything else comes through the queue again, my email one more time to say it's s prusak s p r u s a k at city of Madison calm if you want to send me an email if you want to remain anonymous or if your audio is not working. Thanks, I appreciate that. Okay well I have one more hand in the queue right now. I've seen a couple go on and off here in the last few minutes but we do have Andrew Stevens with with a hand raised so Andrew Stevens floor is yours. Sure, thanks, Kevin. I want to say thank you to everyone for the presentation I missed the first hour because of another meeting, so I apologize if things have been covered already. I'm a downtown resident and I'm also a professor at the university. I am in favor of increased density in the downtown area. Broadly speaking I'm in favor of this proposal and thank you for you know interfacing with all of us. I am consistently concerned about othering our student population. I'm a young professional who lives downtown I'm wondering if this building is for me or not. I'm concerned about the extent to which the university is being asked to contribute to determining who is qualified for a needs based rent and so if those things have been covered already I apologize for asking you again but can you speak to those and to the elected officials on the campus? To the elected officials on the call, how are we ensuring that we're all citizens of the city and eligible for housing in this area and that there aren't two tiers of the system? Well to speak to the approach for the needs based housing. We have reached out to the university to find out if there are ways, the challenges of identifying and meeting needs for student housing. The typical income qualifications have challenges in that we could see a situation where you may have a student who doesn't have an income but has a large, you know, whose parents would. What we're trying to get to is to really try to identify students who need that additional support to help address housing, you know, the disconnect between actual income and availability of housing. So in conversation with the university, one of the options we were discussing were is there a proxy kind of pre-qualified pool of students? They have a lot of students who receive grants who have challenges in finding housing. Could be an opportunity potentially to deliver some housing for that pool of students. Again, this is something that's being talked about in concept stage right now to determine if there's an opportunity for this project to be able to do that. For this project to bridge some of that divide between income and availability of housing for those students. So that's where we're at right now. It's a conversation with the city as well as the university as to how could a program be developed that would help address some of those needs. Beyond that, we see this as a predominantly student housing project. But again, as I stated earlier in the meeting, we will, you know, gladly accept anyone who's interested in living within the building. And they would be treated as any other resident. They would have access to all the amenities, access to, you know, units of their choice. And really, we see that as an opportunity for young professionals who would want to see this as an opportunity to live in the building. They're absolutely welcome. But our target market is more around students just based off of, you know, course approach to housing. But again, we would welcome anyone who's interested in living in the building and would absolutely not tolerate any discrimination of any sort. I appreciate all that. And I will mention that many of my students are looking for housing that they can afford that is near to their classes. That's an important population. It will be most of your renters, I'm sure. And those who have been admitted to University of Wisconsin-Madison are not the entirety of our community. And so there are plenty of people with needs for housing that they can afford who are not our UW-Madison students as well. That comment might be more for our elected officials than for you, Mr. Munson, but I appreciate your answer. Well, thank you. And I would agree as a resident of Madison, I recognize that housing is a challenge across the board. There are needs in every segment of the community for more housing, more housing choices, more affordability in housing. And so that's a challenge that we as a city face everywhere and need to continue to work to do. Unfortunately, it's not a challenge that any one particular project can solve. But we hope that by advancing some of the discussions within this project, we could begin to chip away at least some of the need and perhaps come up with a widget that can be replicated so that other projects could follow in that path. I don't know, Alder Verbeer, if you had any follow ups to that question or looking, I don't have any other hands in the queue. So and looking that we're close to nine o'clock. So I also don't know if you have comments related to that or any sort of closing remarks you'd like to give at this point. Thank you, Kevin. I was thinking the exact same thing and I unmuted myself to respond to Andrew's question, at least in part and in brief, knowing that the meeting is now running almost two hours here. So first, thank you, Andrew. As I mentioned to the Core Spaces development team in our very first meeting, which was back in September about this proposal, I said among the top issues are affordable housing and the displacement of below longtime retailers on this block. And I begged and pleaded with them in that very first conversation in September to please try to address those. I know it was no surprise to anybody on the development team when I said that the hub and the James are seen as being exceedingly unaffordable to the vast majority, I believe, of the UW student body. And I know for a fact that many folks there have to share bedrooms, not just share units or apartments, but double up in bedrooms to be able to meet the rents that are required to live there given the excellent locations and amenities and so forth. So obviously the development team has decided that their main and this was obviously been discussed throughout the last couple hours, but that in return for asking for two additional stories in excess of what's allowed under the zoning code that they would ask policy makers in City Hall to, in essence, give them these bonus stories because of the affordability component that they're buying. The lack of affordable housing is absolutely a crisis in our community and has been for years. It's a personal embarrassment of mine, especially the fact that time and time and time again I'm told by developers in particular in the neighborhood collectively is told that the housing crisis is a crisis in our community. Obviously either privately or collectively in these sorts of neighborhood meetings, public statues, public meetings about development proposals downtown are told the price of land downtown is just too high to allow for affordability to be included in the proposed apartment building. Obviously either privately or collectively in these sorts of neighborhood meetings, public meetings about development proposals downtown are told the price of land downtown is just too high to allow for affordability to be included in the proposed apartment building, let alone on our occupied project like condos, which we've had very few proposals of for many years now downtown. So it's a constant frustration that not only is it is it difficult for for profit developers to be convinced to provide affordable housing downtown, but it's also equally difficult to ask not for profit, affordable housing developers, or even for profit housing developers that specialize in affordable housing and for example section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code projects to consider development downtown because again the cost of land is so significant where many of us in this meeting have the privilege of residing and some owning property downtown. So it's just a huge frustration. I realized that that I could go on quite some time about this. It is, I think, the number one priority for most all of my colleagues who were elected in the last election and will all be sworn in actually tomorrow, collectively in the afternoon that to make affordable housing more of a priority than we've ever made before, but the city has devoted millions of dollars, each and every one of the last several years to try to provide more affordable housing for all segments of our community. The one area where we've been lacking in spades is affordable student housing, because students are forbidden from participating in many of the affordable housing tools that are available for developers, and then of course that added the issue as I mentioned to the land costs in the campus downtown area. So I'm excited about the possibility of actually trying to provide some level of affordability for at least a very small fraction of UW students if and when this proposal is approved and constructed. So I'd be happy to talk to you Andrew or anyone else here about affordable housing downtown or throughout our city or community, one on one offline, knowing that, you know, the hour of nine o'clock is here now. With that said, let me just in closing here thank each of you as I said at the top of the meeting for being here tonight. I appreciate Sydney and Kevin's facilitation tonight and their presentation. I certainly appreciate in advance Sydney you sharing those email addresses for Amal and Tim. And I would like to thank Tim as a reminder if anyone wishes to volunteer for the Neighborhood Steering Committee, which I hope will begin meeting very shortly with the development team. So, you know me, call me text me my numbers and contact information is easily available on the city website, the easiest of all the email addresses is simply district four the number four at city of madison.com. And I will certainly immediately forward any notice of wanting wishing to volunteer for the Steering Committee onto the co chairs of the Steering Committee. So with that, I want to also thank the development team, certainly for their willingness early and often to meet with the community about this and for their participation, of course tonight. And again, thank you all of you for your interest in your very valuable feedback and insights. I've taken several pages of notes here and receive email comments from many people and text messages over the last couple of hours. So, most of them are consistent about the main concerns with the proposal and look forward to continuing the conversation with all of you and the development team moving forward so again thank you all very much for being here and have a good evening on my part. I don't know if there's any closing comments, Kevin or Sydney and your parts. No, I just thanks everybody for being here tonight and if you have contact questions for staff don't hesitate to contact Sydney or myself. Thank you as well for from the development team we really do appreciate everybody taking time this evening and look forward to continuing the dialogue. Thanks everybody.
