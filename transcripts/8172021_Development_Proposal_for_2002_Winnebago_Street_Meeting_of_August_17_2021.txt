============================================================

 appropriate. I'll scold. I'm a father of five. I'll scold folks. Okay, I'll do the floor is yours. Thank you so much, Chris. I really appreciate it and I want to welcome everybody. I'm a little Zoom challenged here myself so I can't see everybody that's with us tonight, but thank you for taking time out of this beautiful evening to come and find out more about this project and to offer your input and answer or offer questions. So I want to thank Chris from city staff, from planning staff for setting this meeting up and facilitating it. And I also want to thank Brandon Cook and his team for paying for the postcards to try to do as far as reach as possible so that folks would know about this meeting. So I don't want to take up much time. I know that there's a lot of information and that there's going to be questions. So with that, I'll turn it over. Thank you. Bring back up the PowerPoint. So just a very brief Zoom 101. Obviously, this meeting is to learn about the project. I'm going to give a brief overview of how to use Zoom, talking about the adopted plan recommendations, primarily the comprehensive plan, and talk about the process. So we just asked if you can keep your microphone muted when not speaking to avoid background noise. And also, if you are having trouble with the bandwidth of the video, we recommend turning off your screen, your video camera. That will help with that. There's a raise function button. I'll show you how to use that in a second. So muting is down here. If you can see my cursor in the lower left corner, the mute button, and then the video button, turning on and off respectively. And then the raise hand function is under reactions at the bottom right. If you click that, this little window pops up and there's a raise hand. You know, it will raise a little virtual hand. I will see that. And then once we get to the Q&A portion, I will call in the names as I see them raised. And then if anyone joins us via phone, it's star six to unmute and star nine to raise your hand. Here's my contact information. If you have any questions during this meeting or moving forward once the development team submits their application, happy to answer them. Very quickly, the comprehensive plan recommends neighborhood mixed use developments for this site, for these two sites rather, which is generally up to 70 units per acre and two to four stories. And very briefly, they have not submitted an application that I'm aware of yet, but they would next do so. And that would be routed to reviewing agencies. And because this will require additional use and a demolition permit, it would go before the city's planning commission meeting. So that would be the opportunity for people to give their input and feedback to the commission, either in advance of the meeting or if you would like to speak at the meeting or register, you would need to do so. Meetings are still being held virtually for the foreseeable future. So there's a little extra, it's a virtual registration process with a link on the first page of the agenda. And I can explain more about that later. But that's the brief kind of overview. And with that, I will turn it over to Kevin and Brandon. All right. Thank you, Chris. I can call up the presentation in a second here, but I want to thank everybody for their time this evening and joining us and talking through this potential development within your neighborhood. Okay, here we go. So what we have before you, as Chris pointed out, is a potential redevelopment of 2002 to 2004 Winnebago Street, which is the area highlighted in yellow here in the middle of the screen. So it's at the intersection of Winnebago and 2nd Street. And it was the former stop and go site, that Quick Trip had purchased, but was unsuccessful in obtaining a liquor license for. And due to that, chose to not develop the property any further and basically put it up for sale and it was sold. So what we're proposing to do is a new mixed use building at this site, while still allowing some commercial use at the corner and then providing additional housing units to this neighborhood. So it's surrounded by commercial development right now at the corner of 2nd and Winnebago. And then across the street behind our site is the 2nd Street Apartments, and then the recently completed Aventine Apartments further down on Atwood Avenue. And then further up the street, there's also been redevelopment for additional housing. So what we are proposing for this site is putting up a three to four story building that would be a mixed use building with commercial space on the corner and then underground parking for the residents as well. So we're utilizing the existing driveway, which is on the north eastern end of Winnebago Street coming in, ramping down to underground parking below the building, but otherwise then eliminating the surface parking lot that you currently see right now in front of the building. And the building does step back on the third floor so that from a sidewalk view, it will appear to be a three story building, transitioning to a four story building behind. So the concept floor plans are shown here with the basement plan being on the left hand side here with the ramp down to underground parking below the entire footprint of the building. And above that, at the corner is where we have our commercial space. So almost 1,100 square feet commercial space at the corner with the main entry lobby space to the building located adjacent to the driveway. And we're also trying, we will be locating a common area amenity of the exercise room on front. So the entire front of the building would be more of a public use type space with the commercial, the exercise room and the building lobby space. Then we transition into apartments beyond that with a mixture of studios, ones and two bedroom apartments. There's a central elevator core within the building and then exit stairs as well. So people have access from the basement all the way up to the upper floors via an elevator. The upper floors, second and third floor would be an identical plan again, a mixture of studios, ones and two bedroom apartments with the elevator located in the middle. And then on the fourth floor level, the building does step back. We're able to create a community room up on that level, which will have access to a larger outdoor patio space along Winnebago streets adjacent to where the service drive is coming into the building. And then we have the opportunity for some larger outdoor patios for these other units that are located on this floor level. So a large two bedroom along second street and then other units behind. So we have put together some concept renderings for what this building would look like on the street. This is a view looking down second street towards the corner with the adjacent commercial building behind us. Coming down the corner and around, or on the side of the building I should say, this is a view along second street as well with the commercial space being up front here. It should have access off of both Winnebago and second street at the corner here. And here's where you can see how the building has stepped back and the fourth floor basically disappears behind the upper story of the facade of the third floor. Coming around the corner then this is a view at the intersection of second and Winnebago with again the commercial space up front here shown by these canopy elements and the building lobby is located back here. All of the apartments do have their own private patios or balconies, so every resident does have their own outdoor gathering space from their apartment. And then the front view along Winnebago street here is where you can see the building entry here, the commercial space, we have the exercise room in the middle, and then again how the building does step back. It's even clearer to see here along second street how the building is recessed back. And then one final view as you're further down Winnebago street looking back because you can see the access to underground parking here with a driveway connection, then the main building entry. And again how the building has this community room up here on fourth floor with a larger outdoor patio space. So it's a mixture of studios, ones and two bedrooms, a total of 24 apartment units just under 1,100 square feet of commercial space and then with underground parking underneath the building as well. So actually we were able to increase the availability of street parking as part of this development by eliminating any driveways along second street, so now there's the opportunity to have street parking come back in to play on that section. So with that I'll jump back to the overall site plan layout and we can open it up to any questions if anybody would like to raise their hand. Okay. We have a question from Mary Johnson. Mary you are muted. Is there any chance that one of your commercial space areas will have the post office that you had taken away from us? Brandon Cook is also on the call here. He can certainly speak to that. Well absolutely when I talked with Brian about it when we initially talked, you know, you know, I think it's more of a neighborhood demand and if the post office would like to come back I got a space for them. That's very good to hear. Thank you. I have another question as well and that is concerning the fourth story. Now it's going to be a third story and I know that the step back is supposed to be a benefit but I don't see it that way at all. I don't think we have another big huge monolith like the fourth story building that is across from the bank building in about the fourth story. No. Thank you. I'm done. Okay thank you. Moving on to Elena White. Yeah I'm here because my main concern is that I'm concerned about having low income or affordable housing in the neighborhood and I'm wondering how expensive are these units going to be? Will there be any way of making units that are below market rate? That's a good question. You know without promising anything, you know, historically all my apartments are very affordable. I have to be better than the competition. I'm a smaller operation. I want to keep good tenants and as a rule of thumb when somebody moves in I don't raise their rent every year forcing people out but it will be a market rate apartment building. So do you know what you're going to be charging for studios, one bedrooms, two bedrooms? I would like to be in the $900 rent. I would like to be in the $900 rent. I would like to be in the $900 range for studios, $1,100 for one and then $1,600 for two. Well that's not very affordable I'm afraid for working families and it concerns me that the neighborhood, you know, where people here are struggling to be able to afford to stay in this neighborhood and this is going to, this is not going to help people who, a one bedroom for $1,100. That's a lot of money. Well I have an apartment building a little bit further down on that wood across from Gala Ambrosia's, I'm saying it wrong, chocolate shop. I have studios in one bedrooms in an older house and it's relatively the same rent and when I put an advertisement on Craigslist I get 100 people-ish wanting to rent that apartment. So it's a demand where people, there's not enough apartments in the neighborhood in this price range where I just have far too many people asking to rent and I only have one or two available. So I think this is filling the need for all the people that inquire about renting an apartment. Would you be willing to have a couple of units that were open to section eight housing? Possibly. I've never had anybody in this neighborhood inquire about using a section eight voucher. Well that's really my main concern is that we're losing what had been a pretty working class business and my concern is that we have affordable housing for the people of this city. Well one of the things that brought me to this project was you know when I met with QuickTrip they said we don't want to be in the neighborhood and my proposal to them was let's do a project like over by Camp Randall where they have a mixed use QuickTrips in the first floor and they said well we didn't get a cooler for liquor or a cooler for beer and they said well I think if we came back with a better project and we kept QuickTrip here it's an asset to the neighborhood and they said let's stop you right there we have no interest in coming back we're selling it we're deed restricting it and those dedestrictions are it can never be a QuickTrip or anything that competes with QuickTrip over the next 50 years and so it's an interesting property that I purchased that it can't be what it was although I would like it to stay what it was it can't be any of those things and I thought it was a great opportunity to not remove any existing housing stock as you see with most developments you demolish affordable housing and you put a new apartment building but this is a nice opportunity to add housing stock without you muted or something we lost your audio Brandon oh can you hear me now yeah sorry I'm actually at the facility and it doesn't have the best reception so I hear what you're saying and I appreciate the fact that you're saying that you're not removing housing stock in order to put in housing stock and that's a very good point and I appreciate that I would just I would urge you to consider you know like one or two units having them at below market rate and just doing something you know charitable on your part I really would urge you to consider that I would that would make me very happy but thank you for listening to me no thank you thank you for giving me that piece of plastic I will make good use of it I promise all right let's move on to thank you for a couple questions one thing I'll point out on the on the note of affordable housing as someone who who I am the director of an organization that does nothing but affordable housing and the way the market works here in Madison everywhere is that affordable housing doesn't get built unless it is subsidized in some fashion and that typically means taking public money and only certain developers are are equipped to do all of the the application and ongoing monitoring and compliance associated with that so it's much more it's much heavier lift than what it may seem from the outside I would say that an area of flexibility would be when people from section 8 vouchers approach or interested in living somewhere frequently the most the biggest reason that they're turned down is because the standardized background check process that many landlords will employ through either the third party management or just internally what they've decided will screen those applicants out because there's something in their background like perhaps a bankruptcy or poor credit history or something else that takes them out of the running for the unit even though they have a voucher that would qualify them and help pay the rent so it's an issue not so much of will the voucher work here it's they get pre-screened out and so that that actually is something Brandon that you would have control over if you wanted to open up your units to some people who might otherwise be screened out as a standardized way of practice and I'd be glad to talk with you about that if you're at all interested but I I suspect that that's what's behind you not receiving any section 8 applicants yeah you know once you open that gate you know you can't just subjectively apply to certain people it's once you accept somebody with a pit bull or any other thing it's you're you open yourself up to discrimination which it's great to keep a nice standardized rental application to get good people good tenants and then you're right I mean if there's any flaws in the rental application it's I can't just allow some people and not allow other people you're completely right from from a fair housing perspective you must treat all applicants the same I'm only suggesting that there could be some things based on the income maybe not maybe not other things you can you there's many provisions that you could keep in across the board and apply equally to all people but again a lot of section 8 applicants maybe people whose only detriment is that they are lower income and they can be screened out by virtue of that and not so much some other things so there may be a way that you can finesse that I appreciate and understand the the conundrum of fair housing and how all rules need to be applied equally I just suggest that there are some things some areas in which you could be flexible sure the other thing I think is and I'm not sure total number of units here is 24 is that correct yes that's correct okay and you do have underground parking but what is the total capacity on site for underground parking and is that included as part of the price or is that an additional add-on to your your your targeted rental rates we have we're able to fit in 14 parking stalls underneath the footprint of the building so there would be potentially 10 units that don't have a parking there or more and then is that is that the parking that's there is that just an optional thing for people or is that a requirement I mean it can't really be a requirement since you don't have enough capacity for everyone who's on site but that that again is an issue I think potentially of concern for the surrounding neighborhood because if there are 10 out of 14 people who have vehicles who cannot park on site they need to park somewhere they will park somewhere I appreciate that you've got some additional on street that is going to occur on Winnebago due to the elimination of one of the driveways but that is another issue of that um that winds up playing a role with the overall function when it comes to parking and for those of you who may have been around for any of the meetings associated with the rework of Winnebago street on which this sits the parking on street parking and the potential elimination thereof was probably the single biggest issue of discussion in that entire process so just to build on the parking issue there would be a parking reduction required I'm pretty sure the requirement is one installed per per unit so the total math of 30% of 24 but it might be an additional additional use for that I think it's more than I think it's more than uh with the all the two waves but off the okay are there any other any other comments or questions Dan Dan if you're speaking your microphone is muted Okay we'll come back to Dan uh Mary Johnson um my I had another question and that was about the rental rate does that include utilities or not So typically how these units are they're all electric and quite honestly the last building I did the the tenant's biggest complaint is the meter charge because the meter charge is the most the biggest part of the bill um because these are so energy efficient so um so it's electric only everything else is included and typical bill per month is about $40 30 of it which being the meter charge So are you envisioning any solar collectors on your rooftop at all to try and also have some of your electricity generated that way We have not had that discussion Okay something to think about great idea I like it Okay thank you Trying again uh Dan up Dan if you're calling on a calling in on a phone try uh star six I believe that's the I knew you otherwise try reconnecting So I this is Dan I forwarded the invite to one of my friends and I think she might be asking a question because I don't have my hand raised sorry for the confusion Okay um whoever your friend is if you're not in the room please call me Whoever your friend is if she or he wants to speak um Hi that was me my name is Sarah um I don't know if you can hear me you can yes um I just had a question about um I live very close by obviously because I'm in this meeting and I was just curious um the rates of those apartments is not something that I could afford and I'm just curious I don't really intend on leaving my own place but like how many would these nicer apartments here um maybe like cause like the other surrounding areas to raise their rent and like in not standard way or like would that happen a few years down the line I'm just curious if it will make like the neighborhood that I live in like less affordable and if I need to like plan on maybe not being able to afford in this zone anymore that was just my only question I guess I can take this one I mean it's always a good thing when you increase supply I mean you have X amount of people that want an apartment and if there's not enough apartments it drives up the price and so like I mentioned before when I'm not subtracting any housing and I'm adding housing if anything it would bring down the price because there's more options for people um like I said I have another apartment building and it's just overwhelming how many people um apply and want to set up a showing for my ones and twos um the demand drives the price and so the less demand they have by more apartments uh would ease the rental rates so no I I wouldn't say uh you have to leave the neighborhood because rents are going up but they do generally go up um in an economy like this in an economy like this that makes sense um I guess in like my experience and in my peer group um I don't know anyone who's looking for an apartment at that uh cost range um and so it kind of sounds like moving forward myself and my own peer group wouldn't be able to compete with that um but I guess that makes sense if it comes in well there's something for there's something for everybody I mean I try and price my more than everybody else's for instance you know one bedrooms typically go for 1300 and if I'm at 1100 I'm decreasing the competition for somebody renting a 900 apartment who really can afford 11 hundred but can't find an 1100 apartment um you know the the sheer cost of this building the size of it it's not a very common thing because it's very expensive to build a smaller building I mean where the bang for the buck is is the bigger projects and so this is kind of a little niche project that isn't that big compared to the other things that have gone up in this neighborhood but you know for me there's not a whole lot of opportunity I can't compete with the bigger people and do bigger projects and get the efficiencies so um I think as a general thumb people like smaller projects but they settle for bigger projects based upon what's available um yeah I have one other question um so if the this the commercial space can't compete with anything like quick trip or a convenience store like that um for the next 50 years does that make the commercial space not be able to ever have like groceries or something like that um basic needs even toiletries because that's kind of been removed from the area and we do have to go for some people out of walking distance now to get those things you know obviously finding a business owner that wants to take over the space is the first hurdle you know I can hope for a lot of different things to go in there but somebody needs to be willing to start a business but quick trip has said you can ask us you know and if we deem it acceptable they just didn't want another quick trip type place coming in and the neighborhood rejected them but it proves somebody else um so I don't know what they would say about a store with a select uh number of items um but they gave the parameters and so I got to stick by them unless I asked for an exception um but the post office would be a great idea yeah do you know what like the like the rental costs of some the commercial space would be um is there even a possibility that like a local convenience store could pop up or you know like one of the smaller things like you see like on Johnson Street and stuff um would it be do you know like a price range of the rental space it's a very interesting conversation and with my other commercial space it's not so much what I want for rent if I charge too much and somebody starts a donut shop and they don't sell enough donuts they're not going to be in business and I'm not going to have a renter so as a landlord I want the most amount of rent but competing with other commercial spaces and having somebody that can go in there with a business and they need to make money frankly or they won't stay open so um generally speaking I try and subtract the commercial space from the equation and hope for the best hope somebody comes by with a great idea that can make money um you know I'm not interested in keeping the space vacant for three years and then finally getting a high dollar tenant I'd rather take less money and have it filled for the three years because over the course of 20 years it equals the same amount of money um and you know I had that option of making it an all-residential building and just my preference uh and Kevin's preference was you know it's a nice continuation of shanks corners there's a lot of commercial space there's walkability and this is an extension of that that adds to it um you know it'd probably be easier for me just to make it a residential space and no commercial but like I said I just I like the look and the feel and the location you know if I take a little bit less in rent and if it's low enough somebody can make a go of it and make money there so I'm excited to see uh what opportunities there are for that space all right thank you thanks Helena wait so I liked what um Mary said about um using solar panels I think that's a great idea and I've also heard that rooftop gardens reduce the heat inside the building and so that helps to reduce the need for um cooling in the summer so that I would like to suggest that as something you could consider rooftop gardens and solar panels I don't know what what the capacity would be for that thank you all right uh thanks Chris um rand and I'd like to point out that the development going in just kind of kiddie corner down at shanks corners across has made a commitment to um providing for uh renewably generated solar um for all common area usage of that building um I don't know that they're going to do it on site because of challenges with that building but there's a way that um it can be done um investing and they made a commitment for that when they did that it may be something that you want to investigate whether that's buying it investing in it even though it's not generated on site or as a flat roof here um it easily could be something that you potentially incorporate that could really drive down um some of the costs associated with the building um with this particular design I think it would be a great thing to look into and Michael Vickerman who's on the sassy board and works for um one of the local solar outfits is an excellent resource on that front he's not attending a meeting tonight but I could certainly put you in touch with him he knows almost everything there is to know about doing solar here in Madison and Wisconsin that'd be great um Jeff Walden okay hi everybody you know first I'd like to say that Kevin I thought you did a beautiful building there I love the brick and I think it's going to be a real asset to the uh to the neighborhood so well done on that thank you and Brandon I you at my understanding that you were planning to build this and own it for a long time right you're not planning on going condo or a quick flip or anything are you no this is uh this is a forever type operation yeah you know I've seen some of your work in the past you always do such quality work and it's your insulation and your your hardwood floors and and your designs are always so I think it's going to be a a beautiful project uh and a welcome addition to the neighborhood I own commercial property not too far from there so I'm looking forward to it and you got my whole support and that's all I have to say about it thank you sure all right um let's see I think Sarah and spring hand is raised uh that was me before do I have to unraise it oh yeah sorry no problem great uh then going back to Brad his question was already asked as well so yeah I already asked mine I forgot to lower my hand sorry about that called the benford thanks chris normally I'd like to wait to the very end but I'm not seeing other hands being raised so I just had a quick question um Brandon you touched on this and Mary brought up the issue and as you know so many people would love a postal station of some type and I understand that that's very complicated that from what I understand you need a host to set it up and then you know folks to work in but has there been any exploration like uh you know in my day job I work with many community-based organizations like finding volunteers even within the neighborhood that might want to help with any effort of that type I think of RSVP that serves senior adults and I also think of the high school um maybe there's some synergy where there could be volunteer workers because uh I'm speaking selfishly and I know so many people miss having a postal station there um is there any more work that you and your team could do to explore it and I could I could also investigate as well that I know you have this commercial space but maybe even a kiosk that people could drop packages off and get the postal supplies and things that they need and I don't know the federal regulations of what it takes to host a site but uh I'm just curious if it could be volunteer driven I think that there's enough interest and uh you know I would go there an hour a week myself to volunteer so is that something you could look more into I'd be willing to look as well yeah absolutely I mean you know I have a space that needs filling and if it was a kiosk uh or some combination I mean I think that would be a nice use for the space thank you Thank you. All right another question from Alison Lindsay Mars. Yes hello um I have a couple of questions how much current commercial space is there on this property compared to the 1100 square foot that you're proposing? Brandon do you know the size of the original building? Let me see. Because you're also going to be taking the laundromat correct? Uh yeah the laundromat has been gutted and so it looks like the convenience store was 2500 square feet. Okay so it's a little bit less than half okay thank you um then if we were to can we go down to the lower level where we've got the parking? So I have a couple of questions yes is there anywhere down there that we can like is or are those at the other end down there the bike racks are they bike racks? Yes there are bike racks I'm sorry I didn't highlight that but yeah we actually have to to see Madison is very kind and requiring that we have one bike rack for every apartment so we'll have 24 bike stalls within the basement. Okay because I was going to say a lot of people in our neighborhood ride bikes so people moving in would probably bring bikes and is there any possibility that this facility is large enough to because there's not an awful lot of parking and people seem to be you know giving up cars if they possibly can for something like a zip car or something to be in this facility or is is that unreasonable for a building this this small? I don't know the specifics on being able to host a zip car I guess Brandon have you ever looked at that for any of your properties? There's one a half a block away in the church parking lot that I use quite frequently but it would be great to add another one or look into that. Because I've been in this neighborhood for over 40 years I lived just down the street a bit and I think this is a tremendous use of this space as it currently stands it's not doing anything for anybody except a few people park there but I think that providing some housing here would be a great idea and the commercial space I think that somebody will move in there and I would I don't know about the post office because the post office has some particular requirements of their own to make a substation in a location such as this so it may well be that the post office themselves wouldn't allow anything to go in here so I think that this is looks good though I think it will be a nice addition to our neighborhood thank you. Thank you. I think the vehicle car charging requirement would apply I don't know exactly how many stalls but there would be a requirement to make at least a few of these parking stalls electric car ready that's obviously not a car sharing program but there would be a sustainable aspect to it. Yes you are right we do have to put in the wiring for electric vehicle charging stations within the basement. All right let's see going back to Mary Johnson. Hi thanks again I can't believe I didn't bring this up earlier but are any of these units going to be accessible or at least accessible ready so that they could be made accessible if someone like me who's in a wheelchair wanted to move in there yes then they have to be an accessible space in the basement too. Yes so we it's yes to all those questions the building will be handicap accessible from the sidewalk and also from the basement level within the building there will be vehicle parking within the basement handicapped accessible parking in the basement and then at least one of the apartments will be set up to be fully handicapped accessible apartment and all the other apartments are what they call adaptable such that they can be converted to for a handicapped render if necessary so every single apartment is adaptable. Oh that's really good to know I appreciate that thank you. Yes you're welcome. All right Jeff Willman. Yeah hi you know I also love the idea of the post office there and I use it often but it's my understanding that the post office didn't want it there because that's a union job so they would that's why that's why there's not a post office here is because they're against it so yeah it'd be great to have one but you're not going to get it unless you know unless you could talk to the post office and have them staff it and pay union wages and it's a very strict union so but it was a great idea I'm sure you'll come up with something Brandon that'll fit in there it'll be an asset to the community but I'm pretty sure it won't be a post office as much as we want one if you gave it to them for free it wouldn't take there you go Sarah again oh this is actually welcome Dan do you have any sense on how long construction would take for a building like this I'm kind of concerned that like for throughout the entire construction process that second street in Winnebago would both be pretty inaccessible around that area for a project of this size construction timeline would be less than a year um but approximately close to a year the way the site is laid out right now we do have a generous setback off of Winnebago street such that Winnebago street would be maintained and the city would likely not grant any permanent lane closures at all possibly just some temporary ones for some certain deliveries but otherwise the intersection does have to be maintained as open because of the adjacent properties okay would that just lead to more usage of second street by the construction equipment or I'm probably not asking the right person but um well there'll be some staging areas the nice thing about having the driveway along the side of the building does give us an opportunity for deliveries to be received and also for circulation on that side off of the street so I don't know Brandon if you have anything specific you want to add to that you're muted Brandon you're so there's so little uh terror space on second street that we will be utilizing the driveway just because I mean there's traffic and to interrupt traffic it's a safety hazard with construction equipment and lulls and bobcats unloading unloading material all right well that's all I have thank you thank you thanks are there any remaining questions so uh Kevin Brandon timeline in terms of you anticipate submitting yes we are looking to do our land use application in the near future we were actually wanting to have this meeting first though before we made any official submittal just to make sure we understood what the concerns were from the immediate neighbors that would be affected by this so with um what our intention is is to submit our initial application to the city for this project on September 1st so a couple weeks from now we will submit paperwork for the project so that the city can start doing their formal reviews of the development and then with a submittal on September 1st that would take us before the plan commission on I believe October 18th and Chris you can confirm my date on that one given that this does not go to UDC and is not a rezoning I believe we will be on the October 18th meeting date September 1st will be in October 18th plan commission yes okay so that would be our desired timeline so just certainly back to my comments earlier if that isn't the case anyone who has comments you're welcome to submit them to me in advance of that October 18th meeting however if you would like to attend the meeting it could be a virtual meeting and you will need to register in advance as you did for this meeting but it would be an opportunity to also give your public testimony up to three minutes not including any follow-up questions from the planning commissioners but two opportunities to give your feedback regarding this proposal so hi this is Julia I live a block away I'm just wondering if your proposal goes through your expected timeline when would you start construction and me and Kevin kind of talked about this I think it'd probably be closer to March April because of the winter months I mean if if we do get great approvals granted I'll bring us right in December January to get a building permit and not the most ideal time to start construction all right any follow-up questions elder I don't know if you have any I just wanted to check in as you just did if there's no more questions I really want to thank you all for attending and thank you Brandon and Kevin and Chris thank you for setting this up really appreciate it and as Chris said if you have questions you can also send them to me and I can forward them to Chris as well and as this moves through the process I'll post notices on my blog so you can all stay abreast to what's going on so with that I want to bid you all a fantastic night if there's no more questions and thank you all again for coming thank you very much for hosting this yeah thanks a lot I appreciate it bye bye
