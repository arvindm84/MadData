============================================================

 Great. Thank you, Debbie. Sure. Do you want me to stay a little while or? No, you can go if you want. Okay. Well, have a good meeting everyone. Okay. Thank you. I should have introduced Debbie. Debbie is part of the council office staff. So she sets up this meeting, all of our zoom meetings, actually. And so we're going to just start when people come in. We'll let them come in. But, um, you know, we're going to meet for an hour. So I want to be true to that. And so let's start out with Juan and Francisco, can you give a little background about yourself and why you want to buy the business at 714 West Badger Road? So I will be, uh, so he doesn't know just translate what he's saying. My name is Juan Gomez. Uh, and his name is Francisco. He's my assistant. Uh, that is, uh, he got to be the manager for the store. Uh, now we want to, uh, to buy the, the business because we want to improve, uh, something else, um, on the business. Um, I'm here on the shop for 10 years and I'm working more than 10 hours to 12 hours a day. And now I feel a little tired. I need to take a, maybe a little rest because, um, it's, uh, it's just, it's a little, um, stressful to stay here all day. All right. Juan, are you going to keep your auto mechanic business? Yes, I do. And have someone else manage it or will you still be managing that? Um, Oh, so he didn't understand your question. I was wondering if you will continue to manage the office or if you will have another person managing it. No, I'm going to get the shop and I, I, I go to work here for, uh, I think for, um, I don't know exactly how long, but I go to continue work and shop. Yep. Well, you've been in the community a long time. You said 10 years, so you, you know, you know, South Madison pretty well. Yeah. Go ahead, Francisco. So I have been, uh, I have been knowing Juan for the last six years. And so basically he's a, he's a man that works from eight in the morning to like 10 at night, Mondays to Saturday at the garage. And you know, cars, cars is not easy. No. I've been assisting him, uh, for the last two years now. Uh, I help manage the storage, uh, the garage here. And then he wants me to also help manage the business. Uh, the main reason he trying to open a mini market is because, uh, he's getting older and you know, he's getting tired in that many hours. So he thought about, he came to me and he was like, Hey, how about you open another business that way I can go home at 12 or 5pm instead of me staying here on your table, you know, on your pen every day. So that's his main, that's the main reason he's trying to open another business. Before application, we try open a mini market in other locations, but, um, uh, though we wasn't able to, because, you know, we have meetings with the neighbors and then, uh, one of the neighbors foods were like, uh, they were kind of, they were like, Oh, we already have. Oh, we already have. So he met, uh, you know, Waka came and he met Waka and then Waka was just getting the license and then Waka seems like a very busy man. I don't know him personally, but he accepted Juan's offer to sell the business. So Juan is, Juan's wish to take over. Can you tell us a little bit about your vision for the business? I have your, um, I think I can pull it up, but I have your, um, floor plan, but can you tell us a little bit about your business in general? Okay. So, uh, a little bit about what the, the mini-markets going to look like. What are you going to be selling something like that? So he has, so his plan is this, Juan's wish to, uh, open the mini-market because he just told me that, uh, he wants to keep studying. He wants to keep, he wants to improve his English. He still wants to learn stuff. So he wants to like be able to live a little bit early so he can take classes or whatever, because you want to, you know, keep studying. And one of the main reason is that about regarding the business plan, he wants to mini-market, uh, what he wants to do. First of all, I think we already talked about the schedule that we told you once again, the schedule is 9 AM to 9 PM on each Friday. Saturday we'll be opening at 10 and then Sundays we'll be opening at 1. Regarding the business, the store, we have been going to the store now because Wakaar has opened. Yes. There is a lot of stuff we would like to change. Uh, Juan's wish to repaint the entire building. That's something he already talked to the owner of the building and he's okay with it. Juan's wants to paint the business. He wants to, you know, by the store, there is like works around both ages. So he wants to like plant, you know, flowers or whatever to make it look better. He wants to, we do the entire parking lot. The way the parking lot is now. Yeah. Oh, I was just going to ask what type of, um, products are you going to have inside the store? What type of food products? Cause we know you are applying for a liquor license, but what food products are you going to have? What are you going to have in your store? The food. We are going to try to buy some pizzas. Pizzas. They are, um, a lot of people look for fast food. We are going to try to buy sandwiches too. Okay. Yeah, we want to buy. We want to buy sandwiches too. That's because, for example, he wants to eat something and there is nothing that he can't find that fast. Okay. So this is something I was going to say, what is it, when you call me? Yesterday, remember I mentioned that there is something we wanted to tell you. Um, so when you go to the building, once you get there, there is a door that is on the other side that goes to the working cooler. In that wall, right now there is coolers of beer. So we want to take those coolers out. There is more coolers than we need. Uh, there is a lot of beers. Quance wants to make it not all about beer. He wants to do that wall and make it for eggs. He's telling me pizzas, eggs, milk, cheese, sandwiches. And then we also will be having a coffee table. Okay. Like a coffee bar. Yeah. So we have a coffee table and the microwave in case someone, you know, we have a lot of apartments. Quance is thinking it's about the people that go early in the morning to, you know, to the works and whatever. So they can maybe stop by, grab a sandwich and leave. So that's his main idea. When I'm eating this, there is like beers, white in the left side. We will be having only food. We'll be having like eggs, cheese. Besides the food, we also thinking about selling the stuff that people use in the day to day basis. So stuff like maybe so, you know, dish. So, uh, toilet paper, handpapers, hand sanitizer, stuff like that. Cheryl, do you have a question? About the location? Nothing I can think of right off the top of my head. Um, I like the idea that there's going to be less, uh, um, less beer. I mean, having it, a large portion of the sales being beer and not, um, food products is, is maybe not the greatest thing. Is, is maybe not the greatest idea. We've kind of been down that road before and had problems with it. Yeah. And that's, that's one of the main reason we don't like, like I told you at the beginning of the meeting, uh, the one is shown is submitting market, not illegal. Sir. So he wants to have a little market that has a little bit of everything. That's where we make sure we're trying to have, uh, instead of having beer all the way around, try to have more groceries. Uh, like I say, juice and then that we use on, you know, paper, so detergent. We want to have special. You wouldn't have, you know, we have beers, juices. Uh, but we try to have at least only one more beer. And then one more. And the one of the coolest would be wines and wine coolers. And then the rest of it on the right side, like I already told you, we have been the coffee table and the food products on the right side, which is by the way, which is why the, by the working. Are you going to be selling craft beers? Or are you going to sell more the standard beers? Like, I don't drink beer, but like Budweiser is the only thing I could come up with. That's not a craft beer, but that can't think of a craft beer. Yeah. Are you talking about cheap beer? No, those specialty beers, like, um, um, uh, nevermind. So, I mean, I can, I think I know what you're talking about. Like spotted. Yes. Thank you. Thank you for saving me. Pia. Okay. Spartacus. Like, you know, like, I know what you're talking about. New blago. Like that. We'll be having some of them because some people died like that. You're not very famous. Okay. I mean, a lot of it, but that would, I knew what I do know once told me he wants to get with of the very, very cheap beer because, you know, you met a lawyer, uh, the lawyer with, you know, who went to meeting with you. And we know, uh, because of him that that place had very, very, um, many problems in the past, uh, from the, from the sending over, making beers. That's why we don't want to sell single beers. We don't want to sell cheap beer that anybody can buy just because we want to avoid them to be there. Yeah. Like I told you on the, with the meeting in case. Yeah. We can hear you. Yeah. Okay. What did you just say? I say, like I told you when we had the meeting with the captain, one of why I decided that in case we have homeless or any type of people, uh, we don't mind calling the non-emergency normal because that's, we want neighborhood. The neighborhood is clean as it is. And we want to keep it that way. Hmm. Pia, do you have any questions? Well, I, I would be interested in seeing like, uh, Corolla or Dulcey or red and white stripe. Are you going to have those as well as some of your other beers? Yeah. Uh, you know, Juan actually he, he Corona here he likes, you know, and I know we're having Corona, which five years ago, I think myself, and we'll try to have as much as we can, but always staying on the standards of the amount of beer we want to sell. And, uh, is beer and wine coolers, the hardest liquor you're going to have, are you going to have hard liquor or just those? Uh, we'll be, we will be having having to show is actually part of the deal. Uh, the, the part of the deal of us getting the business, the, I mean, the business inventory that we offer it. Or in part of it is liquor. We can't hear you. Can you hear me now? Yeah, we can. All right. Sorry. I don't know what's happening with the microphone. So the hard would be, like I say, I was like, I was saying, we are going to show her liquor, however, the hard liquor will stay behind the phone and can I ask about your employees? Uh, yes. So are you, are you having family members or are you putting out, um, want ads for others to join in to be clerks? So soccer, et cetera. So once one of the things you keep moving back from the microphone. Okay. So can you hear me now? Yep. You're going to have to stay lean forward. Yeah. So on the business plan, we presented to the city council, uh, one to the ALRC to the LRC, sorry. One of the, you know, there is so many words and I don't get to know all of them. I know. Yeah. But one of the points he claimed, you know, he states on that document is that he also want to help decreasing unemployment. So he's not making this to employ his family members, but to also give opportunities to people that need a job. Uh, we thinking about having maybe three or four employees on the store. We'll be open to receiving, you know, our CVs and, uh, making, uh, how do you say that, sorry, interviews to whoever wished to work at the store. So he's not hiring family. He's hiring people from outside. So there's a possibility that community people will be able to get hired from the surrounding neighborhoods. So you would be putting up a, um, hiring sign in the window or something like that once you get started. Yes. Once we open, we'll be putting a hiring sign. I would be, I would have, uh, I would have to be there. Uh, but I think we would be able to get in is very fast. Yeah. You would have to interview them and do all the due diligence. Exactly. All the required, um, process that we have to do. Well, I was born and raised in Madison and lived in the south side, almost all of my life and the mom and pop stores that we had that were family owned and family operated seemed to do very well. They always had people there. So to get the business going and keeping it going. So you don't have to worry about somebody calling in sick at the last minute. Um, so any businesses that come in, we want to see you succeed. And so that's why I wondered about family and you including family as well as outsiders. Yeah. So, I mean, I, I consider myself like one's family, so I would be there, you know, but I don't think, uh, we would be closing this obviously when we hire somebody, we'll check his background. We'll make sure he's someone we can trust and someone that will be attending to work in worst-case scenario, somebody doesn't know, doesn't show up. Uh, there's what we have to do. That's why you're going to be me. No, I wish nobody means, but in case that happened, I would have to be there. And so you're looking at a combination of family or people that you know, that are very close to you and hiring from the outside, correct? Yes. Go ahead. Pia. No, I, I, I like the idea of having a coffee table and, um, easy access in and out. Um, I don't know how you're going to redo the driveway, but right now, as far as, you know, pulling in and pulling out, that's fairly easy. I think some people would rather come to a smaller mini-mart than go to a large one or a store to get things, you know, especially if they're on the way to work or school. I think that's a great idea. I also think, uh, I think Cheryl said something about not having so much beer, you know, um, I'm glad you're having food along with that so that you, it's just not a drinking place and it's, uh, you know, I can drink, but I can buy some food to kind of tone down anything I might have in my system, you know. Yeah. And I think for the, for the parking lot, you're going to do some striping, correct? Yes. Yeah. So on this side that looks to the street, there is enough space for like four cars. So when I said we'll be facing it, uh, we'll be, um, making it look new. Was the word you just used? I know what it means, but I can't pronounce it. So striping so people know where, where the spaces are. Exactly. So first of all, they will make it look like new and then we'll be put in size or where they can stop. And then we also want to have a handy car. Yeah. So let me just say that, um, and Juan and Francisco approached me, uh, they wanted to buy the business from work car. Um, work car got a license, I think went into effect in January or February. I can't remember, um, who was going to relocate up here. They approached me. They told me that they really wanted to do more of a mini-mart, which is what we wanted, a place where you can walk down the hill, grab something and walk home. Or on your way to the transfer point or the Madison college, grab a cup of coffee, et cetera. And I thought it was a good idea. So from the point from where they contacted me, we set up a meeting with captain Hanson, that's usually what we do. So they had a long conversation with captain Hanson of the South district. And then from there, I sent out 650 postcards for this meeting and next, um, Wednesday, they'll go before the, um, ALRC, the alcohol license review commission. And from there, if it is approved, they will be at the August 3rd, coming council meeting, and if it gets approved there, then I think it takes, and I could be wrong, but I think it takes 30 days for you to get your physical license. So I think you would have enough time for your renovation, whatever you're going to do, and then your grand grand opening. Are there any questions regarding the process? I would like to see more people attend these meetings. And I know it's hard to get people involved, but what I, you and me both, when you send out 650 and you get two people, I don't even go ahead. Right. One of the ways that might be helpful and easier for people who are not, uh, computer savvy or phone savvy is, um, not having to have to register that if you could jump in on zoom and, um, you know, be a 10, um, that might be an easier way to capture them. Actually, it's interesting. We had more people doing COVID now that COVID's a little bit, um, restrictions are lighter. It, we have less people, so maybe they didn't have nothing to do doing COVID. And that's why they came. So if there aren't any more questions, which is fine, uh, thank you for your suggestion, Pia. Um, the next thing will be that they will be at the ALRC meeting of July 21st, next Wednesday. So anyone who wants to send in a written comment or wants to attend and voice your opinion during public comment is welcome to be there. I'll send that information out in the morning regarding the process. I'll send that out in the morning regarding next Wednesday and one in Francisco, the clerk should be sending you your link to be at that meeting. I have one more question. Sure. Juan and Francisco, um, have you notified the neighbors around your, um, uh, your, uh, intentions as to what's going on and did you get any feedback from them? So we have talked to them. So we happen to have, you know, thanks God we haven't, we happen to have a lot of customers at the body shop. Uh, and it's something that Juan has been, uh, letting people know that he wished to open that, uh, many people like the idea of having a meeting market with a coffee table. Uh, so, and we know people that lives up on the field by the finals and they, they very supportive regarding the change that we want to make. Okay. Okay. And there's an existing business in there right now. Yeah. That's open. I realize that, but you know, with the new, uh, black excellent building coming in and then you got the church up the street and, um, uh, Burger King, just wondering what the feedback is from those business owners. Right. So what happened was that they're the fact that they're opening at one o'clock in the afternoon on Sunday was a direct request from the church. Okay. Great. So that's all I have. Thank you. Thank you. Cheryl, do you have anything else? No, just that I'm wondering a part of the problem with attendance tonight was because of the glitch that I ran into when I tried to register and people didn't, you know, didn't get the second email. Yeah. Yeah. And, and let's face it, the bucks are playing tonight. Oh, that always helps. Yes. And, um, I hate to say it, but we're going to win the championship. So community meetings going on tonight at the same time. So that might be a possibility. Yeah. So a lot of competition. Well, thank you guys. If you don't have any more questions, um, thank you one in Francisco, Sharon, Olympia, we will close the meeting out. I appreciate all the engagement that I received when we have these meetings. Okay. And also, um, Sherry and, uh, Pia, I would be, I wouldn't be texting on the chat Juan's email, so if any of you wish to ask another question that you haven't think about today or have any, um, you know, any kind of doubt, just email him and we'll be happy to answer it. Also, if you have any supportive, you know, ideas that you think that might be good for the neighborhood as well, let us know. We'll be happy to hear it. So second Corona. Oh, okay. I should have had her talk about the beer. You saw how I messed up. I, you should have jumped in right away. You said Budweiser Sherry and I was like, yeah, okay. And I have that one. I know. I couldn't think of anything else. I swear I could. I know there's a Jamaican beer, but I don't know the name of it. That's red and white stripe. Um, I love beer, but I only drink it with spicy food, like, uh, Spanish food, you know, Hispanic food, tacos, pizza, you know, and a lot of people are not bearded, I cannot drink it by itself. So I don't know a lot of them, but I know which ones I like. Oh, okay. Okay. Good to know. Pia. I hope you wrote those names down. She's going to be my representative when it comes to beer names. Thank you, Pia. See you guys. All right. Thank you, Sherry. Thank you, Sherry. Thank you, Pia. Okay. Bye bye. Bye bye.
