============================================================

 I am going to read a disclaimer and put something on the screen for everybody to take a look at. Also to note that this meeting is being recorded. It is a public record subject to disclosure. By continuing to be in the meeting, you are consenting to be recorded and consenting to this record record being released to the public record requesters who may see you, your home, and your family members in the recording. You have the option to turn off your camera and participate with audio only. I wanted to start with just that disclaimer. With that, I will go quickly over tonight's agenda. I will get that back up on the screen. A relatively straightforward agenda tonight. I will just do a quick welcome and some introductions. I am just going to do a quick staff overview. I know we have been doing virtual meetings for quite some time at this point, I would like to start with Zoom. Some people are more familiar with it than others. I will do a quick Zoom tutorial, do a quick overview of the process, and then we will turn it over to the development team and they will do their presentation. Then after that, we will leave it open to questions, answers, and discussion. That is generally the flow of the meeting as I think we have laid out tonight. Before we go any further, Alder Abbas, were you able or would you like to say just a couple remarks here as we get kicked off tonight? Yes, absolutely. Thank you very much, Kevin. I am just trying to get on my laptop from my cell phone. In the meantime, while Alder Abbas gets hooked into the meeting, maybe I will do the quick Zoom overview while he gets hooked up into his laptop. I will just go through the Zoom overview slides. Again, tonight's meeting is for participants to learn about the development, ask questions, and provide feedback at this point. We will open it up for discussion and questions after the developer's presentation. One thing I would ask, if we were meeting in a large room, one speaker at a time, we want to make sure we don't lose any comments and make sure everybody gets a chance to participate. Same basic rules we had if we were meeting in a more conventional setting. Just a couple of Zoom hints. A lot of this is probably things that all of you worked through already, but please keep your microphone muted. If you are not speaking, I know I am coming from a place that is not all that quiet at times, so I am trying to keep my microphone muted here to limit the background noise. I had requested everybody else does the same. If you are having any issues, with your screen getting glitchy or perhaps the feed being a little bit slow, sometimes it does help if you turn your camera off. That is an option available to you. Then we will just talk about participating. We are going to use Zoom's raise hand feature when we get to the Q&A later in the agenda. It is relatively simple, but how to do it, if you look on the bottom of your screen, there is going to be a reactions button. It is right here about two-thirds of the way over. You click on reactions, you will get a pop-up menu and then you just hit raise hand. What that does is that gives me a cue on my side of things and actually puts it in order from when the hands are raised. When we get to the Q&A later in the meeting, I am going to use that to call off names and to use that as our hopefully way to organize it. Funds work pretty well in settings like this. I do not believe we have anybody yet joining us by phone, but in case you are joining us by phone or happen to do that later in the meeting, if you hit star six, that will toggle on and off your mute button. If you hit star nine, that is the raise hand feature. Again, for those joining by phone, star six toggles and turns on and off the mute and star nine is the raise hand. That is really the quick zoom overview. I have just a couple of other process slides that I can jump to, but I will turn it back to Alder Bas. I believe he looks like he is selling on his laptop. If he has any introductory remarks, I will turn it over to you, Alder. Thank you very much, Kevin. Thank you for being here and thank you to everyone on this call to discuss about the affordable housing project. Your opinion matters a lot to me. This is a good opportunity for us to learn about this project. I am here to listen to your feedback and collect your feedback as well as the developers and staff too. Please do not shy ask questions for clarity or information. I just want to make it very clear this particular project is really earlier in its planning stage. This is a neighborhood meeting and after that, once the developer submit application, then it will go to Urban Design Commission for urban design review process. Could be initial slash final approval, depend what type of design and what feedback they collect and then they will also go to Plan Commission for approval as well. Again, Urban Design and Plan Commission both need to approve this project to move forward. And with that, please feel free to after this meeting, it is recorded. I will share the link once the link is available on my blog for those who cannot attend the meeting. Feel free to reach out to me and thanks again for joining today's meeting and I look forward to hear from you all. Kevin, the floor is yours. Thank you. Thanks, Alder. Just a couple other things and then we'll turn it over to the development team. As you'll notice, if you don't want to ask questions, I'm going to have my email open here. So if you want to email me questions, I'm happy to read that for the good of the group. I won't be reading comments in the chat, but I will read comments that are emailed to me and my email is kfirchow at cityofmadison.com. Again, kfirchow at cityofmadison.com. And so if you email me that, when we get to the Q&A, I will read those comments or questions as they come in. Just a little bit about the site, just a little bit of background. I believe everyone's probably familiar enough with the development site, but it's the corner piece, East Washington Avenue, North Second Street and East Mifflin Street. It's the Madison Development Corporation's campus right there. The development team could talk about this in a little bit more detail, but this is the old historic building, a smaller residential building in the back. This is the newer building on the west side of the site and the area we're talking about here is on the Mifflin Street side of the site. And again, I'll let the development team talk about that in a little bit more detail. From a zoning standpoint, the site is zoned. It's TRU1 and that stands for the traditional residential urban one district. What that means is development of this type and scale, as the Alder mentioned, requires review by the city's urban design commission, with the plan commission being the approving body on this request. With the zoning in place right now, there is not a zoning change that's needed. So again, the reviewing bodies would be the urban design commission and the plan commission. Stepping back policy standpoint, the plans recommend low, medium density residential for this piece, which is a different recommendation than the surrounding blocks, which both have lower density zoning and plan recommendations surrounding blocks. So again, just going over the process, we're in the upper left corner here. This is the pre-application discussion. There aren't any formal applications for approval that have been filed. I will note that this development is doing an informational presentation at the urban design commission tomorrow night. That's a non-binding advisory meeting tomorrow night where there will not be a final action taken. The next step down the road would be the developer would file formal applications for review. Those would go under a technical review from different city agencies. And from there, there would be an urban design commission meeting with the final public hearing and a final decision at the plan commission. All in all, the process, once we have an application filed, the time it gets to the plan commission, in this case is going to be about eight to 10 weeks. It depends a little bit about what schedule it is, but once it's scheduled, we're talking roughly about eight to 10 weeks for that process to take place. But again, here we don't have a formal application filed, so we are at the beginning phase. So again, my email, kfirchuw at cityofmadison.com, kfirchuw at cityofmadison.com, and I'll keep my eyes open for emails if you want me to read your comments into the record later this evening. So that is all I have at this point. So if it's okay, I'm happy to share over the development team. They can introduce themselves and do their overview of the presentation. All right. Thank you very much, Kevin. Appreciate that intro there and also the explanation of where we're at in the process. So we are at the very early stages of this, with regards to presenting the initial concepts for review by the neighborhood. And as you mentioned, we are also having a very informal informational presentation tomorrow night at Urban Design Commission as well. Just to gather more feedback on the project before we move it forward officially. So with that, I can share my screen and show the overall concept as we have proposed right now. As Kevin had already pointed out, the site here is located off of East Wash, Second and Mifflin Streets. Zooming in a little closer, again, you can see the layout of the site. We are focusing in on just this back corner of the property that currently houses a surface parking lot and the two-story commercial office building that's been utilized by options and community living for a number of years. But they are vacating and moving out. So the building does need to come down as it's well past its lifetime cycle of being useful. So with that, I'm happy to share my screen. So you can see the context photos of the area around the site shown here. Here's some photos of the recently completed project that just opened up last year called the Grass Camp. So this is the new apartment building that was created on East Washington Avenue and was quite successful with regards to how it fit in to the overall context of this property. You can see the main entry here on the upper picture. And then in the back side of the building is shown here, which overlooks down towards the existing Grass Camp Park. So the overall site layout is shown here. Again, we're proposing a 24-unit, two- to three-story building in this upper corner of the property. The existing buildings are shown here in this brown color. And then the Grass Camp Park area is highlighted here in the upper left-hand corner. So this development does allow for the Grass Camp Park to still move forward at some time in the future if that can come to fruition. The driveway would be located directly off of East Mifflin across from the intersection where South 2nd Street proceeds further on. The overall layout of the building has basement underground parking. And then we also have first floor, second floor, and third floor units. So we do have a total of 24 parking stalls within the basement for the 24-unit apartment building that we have above. There's an elevator service within the building and then all bike parking, mechanicals are accommodated in the basement as well. So the upper floor, the second floor, again has a mixture of studios, one to two bedroom apartments. Then on the third floor, we are actually stepping the building back along Mifflin Street. So it's only a two-story facade quickly along the street and then steps back. So those apartments have the opportunity for larger outdoor patio spaces on that side of the building. Here's some concept elevations of what this building will look like. And again, the design is very similar to the new Grass Camp building that was just completed, which was also tied into the original hospital or historic building on the property. So we want to make sure all these buildings are cohesive in their design and character. We've created some initial perspective views. You can see they're all massing here of the development. The original historic building is shown in the middle here with the smaller housing building and short-looking in the center. The new Grass Camp building, which is a four-story building on East Washington Avenue, and then the location of this two- to three-story building along Mifflin and Second Street, again with the park area still allocated here. Here's some perspective views from the intersection of Second and Mifflin Street, looking back up towards a new building. So again, it's a two-story facade that steps back up to a three-story facade behind. So predominantly a brick facade, again in character to all the other buildings on this parcel. Another view is moved down Mifflin Street looking at the front of the building. Each unit does have their own private balcony space. Those units on first floor also have direct entry directly off of the sidewalk. So the intent here is to really create a townhome-style feel so that all these residents would have direct access to the sidewalk and be able to interact with the neighborhood right away when they move in. Another view looking back towards the building. Here you can see the access towards the underground parking, which is directly across from the intersection of Second Street. Another view looking down towards that. Again, you can see how the building does step back in character and scale. Here is a view on the inside of the property looking towards the original historic building. So again, we maintain the same level of detail and character on all sides of the building. And these units also have direct entry as well. Here's a close-up view along the sidewalk on Mifflin Street. So once you're up, as you're walking along the building, it certainly does feel like a two-story building in character. Then here's a distant view looking back towards the building, further down Mifflin Street again, where you've got the park in the foreground here, the new grass camp building, and then the original hospital historic building in the background there. So this is the overall development. Again, it's a two- to three-story, 24-unit apartment building with underground parking of 24 parking stalls. So with that, you can jump back to the overall site layout. And I can ask if the other development team would like to speak at this point or else we can open it up for questions. Can open it up for questions, Kevin. This is Laurie Heineman. Okay, wonderful. So Kevin Furko, if you want to start the building. Sure, I will help facilitate the Q&A here. But again, if you want to use the raise hand feature, if you click at the bottom of your screen and hit reactions and then raise hand, that will send me a queue on my end. So I'll open that and we have our first hand that's raised. And so first question or comment tonight is Shannon Berry. So Shannon, I will turn it over to you. The floor is yours. Thank you so much. Apologies for my kitchen background. So I live at 110 North Second Street, which is literally right across from Grass Camp Park on the other side of the house that's right there. Can you talk a little bit about any adaptations or modifications that would be made to make that intersection safer? That intersection currently does not have any stop signs. And we do have a lot of traffic that comes whipping around through there. So when I'm thinking about adding 24 more households and having the access point there on the parking lot, excuse me, my daughter's yelling at me. I'm just curious what conversations have been had with the city about potentially adding stop signs and things of that nature. Okay, thank you. Thanks for the question. I think we'll start off and I sorry didn't introduce him at the beginning of the call, but my colleague Sean Malloy from city traffic engineering is here. So Sean, maybe you want to kick off an answer to that one? Sure. Yeah, that's a great point, bringing up that intersection. So if this new development gets approved, we'll have the opportunity to take a deposit to change around the signing at the intersection. I think realigning the driveway where it is today to put in at the intersection makes it more of a traditional four-way intersection, you know, with a stop at the driveway and then we can add a stop to the to the second street approach. And that will kind of clarify the intersection a little better. We can also take a look at the parking there, seeing that we have no parking anytime on that side. With the removal of that driveway, we can look at possibly adding that back in. That would be an option. But in general, I would say that adding the apartment buildings and removing the office building is going to result in a net increase of about 30 trips or so. That's just our estimate. So it's not that big of an increase. And I actually anticipate traffic impacts be generally better than when the office was there. Because with apartment buildings, we typically see people coming and going throughout the day rather than your office building where people all come in at one point or one point in the day and then leave at one point. It's, I guess, less peaky for apartments. So this will present an opportunity to clean up that intersection, add a stop sign, align the driveway so it's a four-way intersection. But from a pure trips perspective, I don't believe it's going to be too impactful. But at least we'll get to fix some of the issues there. Any other follow-ups on that before we move into the next couple of questions? Next two speakers would be Anne, Scott, and Zoe. But I wanted to make sure before we left that one, Shannon, if that answered your questions, if you had any other follow-ups on that? No, it did. I appreciate the thoroughness with the answer. I do think that the parking considerations with options have been challenging for the neighborhood for a while. So I am relieved to see that the parking has been considered as part of this project. So thank you. Well, thank you. Next, we'll have Anne, Scott, followed by Zoe will be next. Anne, the floor is yours. Yes, hi. I live on Second Street in East Washington, right across from the current egress, ingress from the current development. I'm just curious about what you're going to do on Second Street from East Washington to East Mifflin, as currently there are wild people driving. The way that people enter is dangerous. And I can just imagine that there's going to be an increase of traffic coming off of East Washington down Second Street, whipping around East Mifflin. And it currently is a very unsafe situation. So are there any concerns or any recommendations to be putting like traffic calming, speed bumps or anything on Second Street from East Washington? Yeah, that's something we can certainly look at, you know, as well for Second Street. I will note there are some considerations when we put in traffic calling, such as transit would be an issue, but the fire department and emergency routes, it decreases their travel time. But that's a discussion we can have with the fire department and see if they have any issues with that. But yeah, that's something that we can definitely consider to help slow down traffic as we get into this residential neighborhood. Any other follow ups to that? Or looks like we've got a few more hands that have raised up. So, Anne, anything else from you at this point, or we can always come back and get a follow up? No, I think I'm good. I'm just curious because this is becoming a kind of a bypass of the first street lights where people kind of look through Second Street, they hit Packers Avenue. So there is going to be an increase to traffic. There already is an increase to the traffic. So I'm just concerned about safety. But thanks for the explanation. Okay, thank you. Next, Zoe, to be followed by Natasha. Hi, thanks. It's actually Zoe. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I see that. I'm sorry. It's okay. So I also have some concerns about the traffic. I live at 114 or Second Street. So basically, the third house down Second Street from Mifflin. And shortly after moving in, I saw a cyclist who had been hit on the other end of the street at the entrance to Packers Avenue. But again, as everyone is saying, it's really clear that what's happening is people have recognized that Second Street doesn't have the big islands in the middle or any speed bumps. And so they're using it to avoid both the traffic islands on Third and Fourth and the lights at First Street. And there is a bike path on Packers Avenue that has very poor visibility on one side. And people don't respect the stop signs, frankly. So I'm just basically echoing what other people have said. Okay, thank you for the comments. Sean, if there was anything else that you wanted to add to those additional comments? Oh, no. Yeah, we'll look into traffic. No, I appreciate other concerns and people letting us know the issues that they see. So thank you for that. Okay. Next, Natasha is up to be followed by Nick. Natasha? Hi, everybody. I'm not sure if you can hear me. I had some technical difficulties getting on, so I missed part of the presentation. I just wanted to outline a couple of my concerns. For one, aesthetically, the design of the building, if it's going to match the two buildings, the grass camp and I can't remember the name of the corner building, that sounds great to me. So some of my concerns are traffic on East Washington. I think Sean said that he would, or you know, they would, the city will investigate that traffic calming as traffic moves into the neighborhood. Well, I'd just like to remind people that the people who live on East Washington, that is still part of the neighborhood. And the city has not adequately been able to address the traffic problems on East Washington, which impact every crossroad, whether that's the heightened visibility of the crosswalks to the closing of lane at night, that is not sustainable, and it is not a solution. So we can go right from that into the fact that the city is going to be running BART down East Washington. And during rush hour, I don't know if my neighbors are aware of this, during rush hour, heading towards the Capitol, there will be an additional lane of traffic. So we are talking four lanes heading towards the Capitol instead of just the three lanes. To me, that's significant. I don't know in what other city or cities, and maybe there's someone at the city of Madison that can answer this, where do six lane roads run through communities? Because it's not happening on the west side. It's not happening on university. It's not happening on West Wash. So I'm not quite sure why East Wash is looked at so differently. And I also know that my neighbors are aware of the latest kid that died, person that died by McDonald's. You can go up and down East Wash from the Capitol all the way to East Town Mall and maybe count five ghost bikes. The city has not been able to deal with that adequately. And so we're increasing the density along East Washington. To me, it doesn't make sense. So I would love for the neighborhood to get involved in BART. A couple people already expressed concern about the traffic on Mifflin and Second Street. I would add my seconds to that as well, because especially during school, that street is so congested with people parking on both sides. It is extremely dangerous. Adding, if people are going down to fourth to utilize the light, you have parents dropping their kids off in the middle of the road. You're turning right to hit the light. So you can take a left on East Washington and you're going into oncoming sunlight. Parents are stopping. The road is congested. It is already sort of a traffic nightmare in Emerson East for these reasons. And again, the city has not addressed it. And then lastly, I would love to see the city use all these deaths of bicyclists and pedestrians to lobby the railroad for a crossing in between Washington and Johnson. I've gone to so many neighborhood meetings and I hear it time and time again from my neighbors. We want a crossing in the middle. We understand the railroad stance of maintaining an additional crossing. However, the railroad does not understand that we do not want to send our children and our family on to East Washington, East Johnson to cross the streets there. That's what the railroad is missing. So you've built up these great bike corridors on Mifflin, but because of where I live on East Washington and First Street, I can't get to that damn bike corridor. And I'm not going to get to that damn bike corridor unless I send my kids and my family through the intersection at East Washington, First Street or Johnson and First Street. And you know what? They're both shitty options. Okay? They really are. And if you want things to be accessible, I don't understand why we can't leverage that. In one meeting, someone from the city hinted at it was a state thing. Well, during that meeting, I contacted the DOT and they said it's not. The city has power over 151 in the city limits. So I feel like someone's being disingenuous and I feel it's very disingenuous to the residents who live on East Washington and kids walk up and down. There are schools on East Washington. You know, for the city even to stop the speed limit change at the Yajara River and to spend all that money on changing yard signs, I would love to see the data on how that was determined. So and I'm sorry this takes away from the developer's plan, but like the developer is going to be dropping people into this neighborhood and they may not realize that this neighborhood has a shit ton of problems. And also this will be my last comment and I appreciate everyone listening, but the neighborhood is still waiting for Madison Development Corp to build the promised park as well. They just removed the equipment that they took down two years ago. The scrap metal just laid in the grass and I suspect that finally happened because I called the city. So thank you for your time. I appreciate it. I will listen to any feedback while I'm on mute. All right, well thank you. Quite a few comments there. I suppose as far as the traffic ones in East Washington, new rail crossings and so forth, again maybe turn it back to Sean just to kind of touch on that and then the park questions. I'll turn it over to Kevin or Lori or somebody with the MVC. So Sean, any follow-ups on East Wash or the rail crossing comments? Yeah, sure. East Washington, you know what, I think we all know it's been very challenging for us, especially recently with a couple fatalities we have and it is unfortunate. As for the railroad crossing, I believe what the person was referring to was a crossing of at the end of Mifflin Street into Burr Jones Park to better allow a crossing of the river. That's something that we have looked at. We've worked with the officer, commissioner of railroads, a couple times on path crossings and it's typically not easy to get the crossing. But we are working on an alternative solution with the development of the apartment at East Washington First. We are requiring wider sidewalks on First and East Washington to allow more space for bikers and walkers to get from that East Mifflin First intersection to the East Washington Bridge and that will allow a crossing of the railroad and the river to be able to get people to Dayton and Mifflin. It's not the most direct route, but it is a route that's safer. So with that, that's our plan in the meantime and we will continue to work with the railroad to see if the crossing is possible there. But those typically take several years to get the railroad to agree with us and allow a crossing. So it's not an easy process, but we have something in place hopefully in the next year or so as that development is built to allow for bikes and peds to get across the river and the railroad using a wider sidewalk. If I could just interrupt you over there. Unfortunately, that won't help me because I'm on the other side. So I still will have to cross East Wash and First Street with my kids who are two and four. So I'm glad that they're widening the sidewalks, but that's not a solution and it doesn't calm the traffic. And you know, it's just like the literally the city kicks this can down the line for years and it's the same old story. We're studying it. We're studying it. We're doing things. Well, I'm going to start advocating and getting my neighborhood together to maybe East Wash should be two lanes each way. And the other lane should be solely a bike lane because the streets are not made just for cars. Thank you. Circling back on the other part of the question, the park question, Kevin, does somebody on your team want to speak to that? Yeah, I can start. So the park is still intended to try and move forward. It's been delayed to this point due to fundraising efforts, basically. But we have allocated space for the park. We still intend to provide one if possible. Just please keep in mind that this is private property and was a private park. But in honor of grass camp, it certainly would like to be maintained. I can show a concept image of what's been envisioned for the park that we're working on. But again, it's still working on some fundraising efforts. This is a... Okay, but again, excuse me. The park was part of the original plan of grass camp, which was approved by the city and is just one element that did not come through. So if I'm waiting continuously for funding when it was approved as part of the development plan, initially, someone's dropping the ball. And that may not be MDC. That may be the city and failing to hold them to that. I appreciate your comments. So again, and then here's another perspective view of some of the equipment that's being envisioned to go into this park area. Yeah. To follow up, if there is a compliance issue that would be through the city's zoning office, and I will follow up with zoning and see the status of that. So that can be a follow up. You've got my email if you want to follow up. I can put you in contact with zoning staff because they're the enforcement arm that you mentioned. I'd like to make a comment. This is Lori Heineman. I'm the president of Madison Development Corporation. I got to really know the story of James Grass Camp and his amazing life and the people he inspired. As Kevin mentioned, this is a privately owned park. The city, we actually paid what's called park impact fees. The city does not own this park, nor did the city put a mandate as for what we needed to do with this park. The 44 unit was approved as part of an overall concept site plan. That being said, I am personally, and MDC is very interested in rebuilding this park in James Grass Camp's honor. It's the first universally designed, fully handicapped, accessible park that was built in the state of Wisconsin in 1989 when it was dedicated to him. We are very interested in pursuing that. Let me talk about the three different sources of funding for this. First of all, the city is not a source of funding. It is a privately held park. It is not under the parks division. We did, however, work with the parks division to talk about how we could help design a nice park that would fit the scale for the neighborhood. We've had an original plan that was put together that was shared with the East Emerson Neighborhood Association. We went started going to local foundations in late 2019 and early 2020 to put an ask in to see if they would be willing to fund 10, 20, 10 to $25,000. We started that effort when the grant cycles began, like I said, which was in early 2020. Every foundation that we followed up with said that they were 100% focused on basic needs when the pandemic hit. So we went into a basically a quiet period knowing that there was no possible way we would get any local funding due to the fact that so many foundations had focused on food, shelter, and other required needs during the pandemic. So we went back to the Grass Camp alumni, which I don't know if the neighbors know, but James Grass Camp started the largest real estate alumni association in the world. And so we went back to the alumni, several who we knew he was very beloved by, and sat down with them and said, what do you think of the scale of the park? What do you think about the park? Would you be willing to fund the park? So many of them said, yes, we'd certainly be willing to help out, but not at the scale that it's at. We'd like to see more green space. We want to keep the handicap accessibility and make it usable. So come back with some plans and let us know what those are. So at this point in time, we have reached out to the alumni. We are going to have an event for the alumni when they come into town into September to present this park concepts site plan and see if they want to partner with MDC to rebuild the park. So, and the third part is, of course, Madison Development Corporation has put a tremendous amount of time into designing this new 24 units so that it is not on the grass camp park site, despite the fact that there is capacity to build a larger building. So, you know, our goal is, is, has not changed from the beginning. We fully intend to rebuild the park. It is dependent on our ability to raise the funds to do so. And that is the project that we're kicking off again this fall. So if there's any questions on that, I'd be happy to answer them. Any additional thoughts? This is just Natasha. I will just say that, you know, I was at those original meetings where that was promised to the neighborhood. And I am all for having an accessible park. I just don't like the, you know, that that final component is just going to be trickled out years, you know, later when there's, there's no follow through then to the community. And that's upsetting to me. And it's upsetting to me again, that the city allows that to happen. So is there a question in that? There isn't, Lori, but I think many of us probably on this meeting attended their original meetings, went through the zoning process, the urban development that was always part of the original plan. I've seen the completion of the project over two years ago, you were able to hold a ribbon cutting ceremony. I'm just waiting for the park. And like I said, the old equipment never went anywhere. You know, I mean, it's clearly you, you can say all you want about working with the grass camp and, but it's clearly not your number one priority. And I can understand why it's not. However, I'm sure you can understand that for parents and kids in the neighborhood, it is a big priority. And it is a priority to not have an open construction site with, you know, pallets stacked 10 high and, you know, sheet metal slides stacked up in the corner. So, you know, I'm, I, I see your side, but I would hope that you could also see. Yes, I certainly understand your concerns. I don't know if I'm still on or not, but I didn't. And I didn't, you, Natasha, so I don't know what happened. It cut off there. So, okay, Natasha, if you want to finish up, I'm not sure you're saying I just, it goes two ways. And if, if someone needs to say it for the neighborhood, because it's, it sucks, you know, and it's, you know, when is it going to happen in 10 years? I mean, you know, and then on top of all of these compacted issues, it's stressful. Well, I would certainly agree with you that the pandemic has been stressful for all of us. And for us to even be able to complete the 44 unit, we felt very fortunate. It was a very difficult project to do during the pandemic. And I'm sure you probably are aware that slowed down a lot of projects. And like I said, we, we still have that site set aside for the grass camp park and we hope to rebuild it. That has been our plan since day one, that it's still our plan and appreciate your patience on it. But I will tell you, it does take money and it's probably about, you know, over well over a hundred thousand. So if you have some ideas and how to raise that money, I'm certainly working on it. And, you know, I can tell you over the last two years, it's been our priority to complete this project. It's been our priority to work with our tenants, to keep them in their homes and, you know, kind of live through the pandemic and make sure that our 348 tenants, including the 76 we now have at the Avenue site are well taken care of. And so that's been our priority. Our tenants are number one. At this point, I'm going to, we've got a couple more hands in the queue. Nick is next to be followed by Tess. Nick, I'll turn it over to you. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I am a resident at the Avenue and my question is kind of based around, so during this whole meeting, I haven't really heard anyone talk about the affordability aspect. I heard the Alder say at the beginning that this is a really important issue to him. I'm just wondering if someone can break down what the idea is for how the affordability aspect for the new proposed unit would work. And then another thing I was just thinking, you know, I'm kind of wondering as far as the park goes, has MDC considered donating it, that plot of land to the city, and then maybe the Parks Commission could take over that park? Just throwing that out there. Thank you. Thank you. Laurie, did you want to jump in first? Well, so the goal on the affordability, Nick, it's a great question. So our MDC, we have 348 units throughout the greater Madison area, and of those units, 72% of all of our tenants make under 60% of the area median income. So this is yet another affordable workforce housing project. We intend to rent, you know, to households who make between 40 to 80% of the area median income. I can tell you on the Avenue site overall, which includes the grass camp and the main hospital building and the side building, we have a total of 103 tenants. And of those tenants, we tend to have quite the great majority under 60% of the AMI. We have quite a bit of diversity as well. If you live in the Avenue, Nick, you probably know that we have about 10 to 11% of people who are disabled. We have about 15% that are children. And we have about 35% overall on the site that are people of color. So we do believe in kind of focusing on providing households who make between 40 to 80% of the area median income, affordable housing. And so maybe Cashin, if you're on, you can kind of talk about some of the rent levels throughout the site. That would be great. Yeah, so the grass camp has some different funds to it. So the rent prices can vary. But, you know, your standard efficiency, which are efficiencies are pretty good size compared to the city average are about 500 square feet. You know, the affordable ones are in the, you know, 700 range. The non-restricted units, you know, they're still in the affordable range, they're low 800s, where if you look around the city, the efficiency that size in a new building is going to be going closer to 900 to 1000. And then our one bedrooms, the ones that we keep at like the 50% units, those are closer to low 800s. And then the higher the income, they go up a little bit higher as well just depends on the two bedrooms, are you looking at, you know, even our highest max two bed, two back that the grass camp building is about 800 a person. But that's going to be for higher household incomes, we're only allowed to have so many of those within, you know, the property. So even, you know, our definition of market rate units is not true market when you look around the market in the Madison area. So the exact rents for this unit are going to be probably pretty similar to the grass camp. And how we structure that as well, we'll have so many 50% units, 60% units, a few in the middle range. And then like the avenue where Nick happens to live now, we have, you know, done some updates that building, we put a new roof on, we're in the process of replacing all the windows, hopefully that gets finished up soon. We've remodeled some of the units, you know, and even the remodeled units, we're still renting for about, you know, the 900 range, but we include some things like free parking, which is pretty unheard of for the Madison area. So really just depends on that site has, you know, three different buildings. But you know, the pricing is a little bit different on each of those, but it's definitely still, you know, very, you know, compared to the markets, you know, very affordable for the area. And I would just add to that the grass camp building itself, the prices that we have on those rents will probably be similar to the 24 unit. The grass has camp has quite a few amenities, we put a leasing office in there that is quite large, that, you know, we may make available to the community, we tried to design it that way. We have not really even occupied it ourselves yet due to the pandemic. We also put an exercise room in there and we put a community room up on the fourth floor patio, which our tenants are able to use, you know, for their guests and has a nice patio overlooking the grass camp park site. And then of course, it has the underground parking space, which basically, one of the big issues I recall a few years ago, when we were talking about adding to this particular site was concerned about parking. So we made sure that there were ample underground parking spot spots as well as parking along, you know, the front. And then of course, we have ample parking at the grass camp, or the Avenue site right next to the grass camp. So that's why the proposed building, we thought it was important because of all the complaints about options and community living and there are several hundred employees parking that there is, you know, going to be 24 underground parking spaces. Plus, actually, it doesn't quite show on here, but the grass camp park design would also have a little parking lot right by the grass camp park. Can I chime in too? Yeah, thank you. This is all the same about here. Nick, I think it's an interesting idea about donating the land to the park. I'm not sure how much feasible it's going to be. My experience working with the park department, especially as an older of the district issue on protecting Hartmire land, also Remish Farm. My understanding is the park department is very reluctant to develop small parks in the city of Madison. The planning process, they are more leaning towards a five acreage park. But having said that, I could check that with the park superintendent and touch base with Lori and see if there's anything we could, as a city, could help with this project or if there is a path forward. I think so the idea could be, I like the idea what you said, but at the same time, my experiences are not super optimistic, but I would definitely give a try and talk to the city staff as well as MDC management and see if there is a path forward. But thank you very much for bringing that. Thanks, Alder. Nick, did you have any follow ups or anything else at this point? No, thank you. And thanks for answering my questions. Thanks, Nick. Okay, we'll go to Tess in a moment. She's the next hand. There's been a few questions I've seen. I just wanted to just note for those who got in a little bit late, if you are having questions about the raise hand function, again, it's at the bottom of your screen. I think there's a smiley face in the kind of on the right side says reactions. If you click on reactions, you're going to pop up menu and then under that there's a raise hand feature. So please utilize that if you want to get an acute answer questions. And with that, Tess, I will turn the floor over to you. Hello, I'm sorry, I didn't put my last name on there. I missed that step in joining the meeting. My last name is Camacho. I live at 102 North Second Street. So right across from Yep, right by that crosswalk, no other side. And yeah, so anyway, I was optimistic, say what you just mentioned about working with the city to see what we could do with the park. I just want to emphasize like how much we enjoyed the park when it was there and that this part of the neighborhood, as other people have talked about, it's very hard to get in and out of this neighborhood. We've talked about it being an island in the past. And you do have children that live, you know, and families that live in the Madison Development Corporation apartment, and they also need parks. They don't seem to often join these meetings and express that. But you know, we, the kids need places to go. And whether this is a private park or a city park, we really, really value it. And the next other options for going to parks would be going to, like to not have to cross all of the major streets that we're surrounded by would be going to Emerson School, which still you have to go through Fourth Street, you have to go through another parking lot, and it's not always safe during high school times. You know, you have that a lot of stuff going on there as well. And you know, even when the kids are old enough that you can say, ride your bike to Emerson, you still don't feel confident that it's safe for them to get there, because of the way that people rip through our neighborhood as, you know, it's just, we're trying so much to hold this neighborhood together as residential. And, and it's just how, you know, the traffic issues are immense. So having a park that, you know, where I live, it was great, I could just send my kid over there and look out the window, you know, and I also enjoyed seeing other children play there, maybe I don't know who they are. So it's, it's been really hard during the pandemic to not have that park and to have it as a construction zone. And now there's a dead tree there, I would love to see the dead tree cut down, that's actually not safe to have a dead tree standing with branches that could fall down. And it's barely even grass, people don't even seem real comfortable even like walking through there with their dogs, they don't really use that space, even though it's there, I don't, I mean, because it's still kind of a construction zone. So anyway, just wanted to say like, as far as our options for going to parks, we can walk past a homeless shelter for men, which is, I'm glad they have a place to go, but like, you know, a little depressing at times, and that's going on there. And again, I don't feel comfortable sending my kid through any of those intersections, if you know, the younger ones. So really hope that we can get a park. And if there's, you know, if we need help, fundraising or committees, maybe we could get more involved with that, if MDC could really be working on that would be great if you have the time to work on a three story building proposal, I think maybe you have time to work on a park. We also were under the impression that we weren't going to have a building developed there anytime in the near future. So that was a bit shocking. Another thing I'd like to say is that one of the neighbors on over by Natasha had mentioned to me how they were surprised at the way noise echoes off of the new building. And that's something I guess I had never read about in developments or thought about. And so that's something to consider when you're putting up when you're increasing density in a neighborhood and you're putting up more buildings, and taking away trees and green space, and trying to optimize your capacity on the property for your, you know, it's just that's probably going to happen. It's not something I guess people think about. I think we think about shade. So that that's another important thing that I'd like to be considered is the possibility of noise. As far as some of the traffic concerns, I think that what the city said and then the planning with occupants of the building being their day versus night or whatever, that's probably true. Most of our traffic concerns are probably not even people that live in the neighborhood, but that's still something that needs to be addressed. Also, our roads are actually much, much narrower than what is shown in the renderings of the by the architects. They always make it look really grandiose. Our roads are quite narrow, even if you compare them to like Mifflin Street down on the other side of the Yajar River. I mean, ideally, not that I want to eliminate parking, we should probably only have parking on one side of the street. It's just too tight. So when you, I don't know what the best solution is for an entrance to this building, but I don't know that being across from Mifflin Street, I mean, I can see how that kind of makes sense. I really don't know what the solution is, but it is a concern about anywhere that you're going to put that entrance just because of, yeah, I think it really needs to be taken into full consideration how that's going to impact the neighborhood. I think that's all I have to say for now. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. I don't know, you had quite a few points in there. So I don't know, start with Kevin or anybody in the MVC team, if they just had any responses to any of Tess's questions or comments. This is Lori Heineman. I actually have one, one of the things we thought about Tess is that we put a temporary park installation and we even had Lee recreation over there. Just so you know, the reason, I mean, we wanted to keep the swings and some of the original equipment and we were told that we couldn't do that. They couldn't reinstall it safely. So we would have to get new equipment. And so we thought, well, that park's going to sit there for like another year. And what can we do to temporarily make it a usable park that'll last through the fall and the winter until, you know, at least next year until we, you know, break ground. And so we thought about putting a temporary installation with sandbox diggers and some swings and, you know, just kind of a more modest design. And I'm wondering what people's thoughts on that are, because of course it's not the big grand park, but it's at least something that gets, you know, some sod or grass in there and makes it playable for the next year. And I would love to hear people's feedback on that because I did not get a real strong positive response from the board, but I think that our MDC staff would be certainly willing to do something to make it more playable over the next year. I think that's a good idea. I mean, especially being in the Avenue, there's not a lot of space to, if you live here, to kind of get outside and just sit somewhere. So even like a couple picnic tables that are nice out there would be kind of a nice change for, I think, the people that live in the Avenue, at least, I don't know. And Laura, you know, I'll go to the board. Thanks for the comment, Nick. I like the idea of the picnic tables too. That is the one thing we were able to save is the picnic table. Yeah, I mean, there, I think that's a good point, Nick. I mean, we, there was one night where there was probably, it sounded like three to five kids screaming at the top of their lungs at, on the mezzanine for hours. And, you know, I just kept thinking if they just had a park, and I don't know why they wouldn't just go roll around in the grass or whatever, but it's just, I don't know, there's something about the space, I think, because the construction equipment's still there that people don't really know that, or I don't know. So something would be good. I mean, there are parks like it, which school is that, over on Atwood, and they've made like a little park area out of some of the trees that, like big logs, you know, you can do natural park areas that, just something to climb on, like you're saying, Lori, that would be, you know, even just to like designate or like park benches. I think for now, yeah, and if the kids, the kids in the apartment, hopefully would use it and be able to come out, like Nick said, and have more space and maybe not run in the hallways or whatever could be happening. Hi, this is Shannon Berry. I concur with both Nick and Tess. I think anything that you can do to make it feel welcoming, whether it's park benches or picnic tables, kids play soccer in front of my house all the time, like the kids across the street and kids from the avenue who come over, and it terrifies me because the cars are running through here, but they don't have, even though it's just like a big open space right there, I don't think that they feel welcome. And so if it's anything that could even be temporary, like, you know, my kid loves to swing, like we have a swing set in our backyard, but she always still asks about, what are the swings coming back in the park? Just something that where kids feel like they can be there, because right now, I think to Tess's point, they feel like it's kind of a closed off area, like the construction area. So Lori, I just want to tell you how much I appreciate that you've been thinking about that. And I don't think it has to be anything extravagant. It could be just something very minimal that makes it feel like it is open space again for the neighborhood. So thank you. Thank you, Shannon. And thank you, Tess and Natasha. Anything else on that one? Natasha has her hand up again, but I didn't want to move on if there was any more comments on that last one. Otherwise, Natasha will turn it back over to you here in a second. Yes, this is Abby Walhous from Madison Development Corp. I think we should address Tess's comment about she was under the impression there wouldn't be a new building in that space for quite some time. There was actually some rewrites in the zoning code since we went to development on the Grascam building, the 44 building. And maybe Kevin, you could speak a little bit about that, Kevin Burrow? Yes, thank you. You're right. The city has updated the zoning code across the entire city in order to make sure that the building is in the same size as the other city in order to try and promote additional density. In fact, encourage additional density in certain areas of the city. So they have changed the requirements such that we are now allowed to have additional units on this property. We're actually allowed to have quite a few more units, but we're not even going close to the allocation that we could have. We're simply trying to add additional housing units to an area that has a need for it. I'm just curious when those zonings change. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar. Is that just the city planning? I mean, who changes those zoning codes? Is that like the city legislation? I mean, how does that work quickly? I'm sorry. I just don't know. I'll jump in quickly if Alder Boss has other comments. But change to the zoning is actually a change from the city council. In that case, it's one that's reviewed by the planning commission, their advisory on changes to the zoning code. But ultimately, it's just like any city ordinance, the city council is the deciding body. The change that Kevin was discussing, what it did was it did increase the maximum allowable density. But in this case, it doesn't require, there's still the review. It's called the conditional use. And to boil that down, a conditional use is a use that's allowed only after the planning commission approves it. So it does have that layer of review. Conditional use standards largely relate to impacts on surrounding properties and so forth. So that's kind of the review that we talked about at the beginning of the meeting. And that didn't change with this process. So that that's still, like I said, that process would be similar to what happened a few years ago when the grass camp building went through. So I just heard you say it was ultimately the council who kind of made that call? The city council does approve, yes, the changes to the zoning code. It didn't. Okay. Yep. Yep. Okay. And then can I just ask the Alder if you voted for or against that change? I voted against that change because it will take community power to provide feedback from the project away. And however, fully committed to do neighborhood association meeting, but I do think so community should have a power to provide feedback through conditional use. So that's the reason I voted against. And I was very clear about my stance about why I voted against. It was passed through 11 to 9 votes. So there was 11 votes in favor barely passed. Thank you. Okay, well, I think there aren't other comments on that. Natasha, you've had your your virtual hand up here for a few minutes. I'll turn it back over to you. Natasha, you have another comment question? I don't I don't have a technical issue. I see your your microphone turning on and off, but I'm not hearing anything. Have you muted me? Nope, I have not muted anyone. But so you just heard me? As I just heard you right there. That was that's all like her. Okay, I think I think maybe the facilitator host had me muted. Which that's a whole mother. Excuse me, excuse me. That's a whole mother issue. So I just wanted to say I agree if you're not muted, if you're not muted, I agree if Lori and MBC are willing to do anything, I suspect the neighborhood would take, you know, just a field over over what it is, and happily take a field. So there's that and then in regard, I just wanted to also comment on the, you know, Tess had mentioned that space where community connection is, you know, she had been under the impression that that was going to be a green space. If you go back in the minutes, if you go back to the meetings from the original proposals, and my husband and I went to all those meetings, they MBC did indicate that that the plan was then to take that down and leave it as additional green space. However, the very last meeting when I testified in front of the Common Council, a chair or someone from the board of MBC also testified, and in his statement, and I don't know his name, but he indicated they didn't plan to develop that. So they flip flopped in that very, in that very timeframe of the building process then. So I'm not at all surprised. It would be a waste to not develop it. So it's here nor there, but I just wanted to have it on the record. So people can go back and find that and see that comment. Thank you. And also I don't appreciate being muted when other people are not. You should just have consistent rules for participation across the board. Thank you. And I'd like to be really clear for everybody on this call, and I'm working as hard as I can. I am not muting or unmuting folks here on this call, and I'm giving you my word of that. I'm not sure what happened the last time I called you a couple times, called on you a couple times, and I apologize if there's a technical issue, but I am not muting or unmuting anyone on my end here. So I just want to be very, very clear about that to everybody on the call. So at this point, I guess, are there other questions or call? I do have an email question or comment that came in. I'm just seeing this now. So while people want to get in the queue questions, I'll read this one. It's from Anne. And I'll be a second here. Thanks for organizing the meeting tonight. Some additional comments and questions. First part, has the city development considered a neighborhood density with the future of first and East Washington proposal? Also consider additional traffic with that development and the public market in the future. As far as the setting of recommended densities, densities actually is covered in a couple of different ways. It's actually the zoning code is the defining, I guess, city ordinance that kind of caps the maximum density. Outside of that, there's a variety of plan recommendations. There's city's comprehensive plan, which covers the entire city. And that really provides density recommendations for the whole site. So each of these sites have different recommendations. I think, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, this one is recommended for low medium density. And I think the East Washington site had a mixed use recommendation, so it had a higher density recommendation a few blocks to the West. The next question, it seems that the city is placing these developments first in East Washington, grass camp, carbon along the quarter, but not doing anything about traffic patterns. You know, I think Sean's spoke to that. I guess I would defer to that traffic engineering part of the conditional standards that are review do have to talk about the traffic impacts of a site. And so that is part of the underlying recommendation. And the city traffic engineer does make a recommendation in terms of comments and conditions that might be applied to projects. And Sean had mentioned some things that they're looking at in relationship to this proposal. Third point here, noise. With more people, noise increased, car stereos, racing motors, and buildings do amplify it. Reckless driving, the ingress egress on second street is currently a hazard. Placing the ingress egress across from second street will be just as hazardous as drivers will not obey traffic signs and collisions will occur. Animals and children were at risk with dangerous driving. So, you know, that noise and reckless driving, not so much maybe a planning issue, certainly issues that I'm hearing tonight, significant concerns for the neighborhood. Some of that is traffic. Some of that are other enforcement mechanisms. But thanks for that comment. And there's one more here on the list. It says upper decks on Mifflin. This will be an opportunity for late hour parties and more noise. I thought that these were an issue with the grass camp development. Thanks for listening. So again, I tried to address those, I guess, as best I could there. I don't know, Kevin or somebody in the development team about balconies. I think the question here, I talked about balconies in the grass camp. I don't know balconies on the new proposal. So maybe if you wanted to pick up there. Yeah, we thank you, Kevin. We do have private balconies for every single apartment on this proposed building, as we currently do for the grass camp building as well. And there are those four units on the north side of the property that along East Mifflin would have an opportunity for a slightly larger balcony. But all residents do have access to their own outdoor space. Sorry about that. I apologize for that. Two hands raised. I have Harry to be followed by Nick again. But Harry, I'll turn it over to you right now. Okay. I just wanted to let Tess know we do have plans to see that and cut the dead tree down. We have a signed contract with Bowie Landscaping. So that is already in the plan. So everyone does know that. Also, this is Lori Heineman. If I could make one more comment. Okay. So on the corner, Kevin, of 2nd and Mifflin, when we were going through the neighborhood meetings, and I remember going to several ENA meetings myself, and the thought was, we've had some complaints about the condition of that building, and we knew that eventually our tenant was going to be leaving. They did give us notice. They are leaving on September 30th of this year, totally vacating it. They've primarily vacated it now. And we agreed that we would not re-rent that building because of its bad condition. But we did not agree to say it would be permanent green space. But we did agree to not re-rent it. And we are not going to be re-renting it. We will be raising it and hopefully building a much nicer, ecstatic building. I just have two more quick comments, and then I got to run actually. But first of all, I was just wondering if that loading zone on 2nd, since options is no longer there, will that be removed? There's a, I don't know how much footage it is, probably about 20 foot between two signs of no loading zone or a loading zone so you can't park there. Will that be removed because options are gone? And the other comment I have is I'm just kind of hoping that the developers, if this does move forward, could maybe please try to consider the least amount of impact on the sidewalk, especially maybe around 2nd. As Laurie had mentioned earlier, there's a lot of people with disabilities and elderly people, especially with dogs who live in the avenue. And that, having some of that sidewalk all torn up, especially in the winter months, would be really hard on them and their dogs. Thank you. Yeah, great point. Thank you for that. Well, thanks, Nick. I don't see any more comments or I shouldn't say I don't see any. Well, I don't see any comments in my email. I don't see any more hands up at the moment, but perhaps do a more check. Okay, but I think I'm going to ask a question about the loading zone on 2nd Street. So if I'm looking at the same loading zone, I believe that's more for the avenue loading zone. That's for the passengers with disabilities being able to get out, get into that building. So we would keep that loading zone. I don't really understand that because the actual accessibility, I think, to get in the building, there is kind of a ramp, but it's pretty far from that loading zone. I think the accessibility point now would probably be in the front of the building. I'm pretty sure the only thing I ever, I live, my windows face the loading zone. I've lived here for about seven years. The only thing I've ever seen for loading coming there is from, because the entryway to the options was right there. Okay, well, yeah, that's something we can take a look at. Change in signing isn't too difficult. So yeah, that's something we can evaluate. We're still pretty early on in the process. That's a minor detail, I guess, but thanks for bringing that up. Thank you. Thanks. I think, Tess, raise your hand again. So I'll turn it back over to you. I just, I don't know, I guess I was kind of thinking about the other little existing building. And, you know, I hope that that's being considered. That's such an unusual layout. And, I mean, I, yeah, that building's weird. It's kind of like low in one spot, like basement. And so I was wondering, like, if anything's going to be, I don't know, like, changed. You know, part of it too is the parking lot. So right now, it's always hard to visualize these things. How, like, what the ground level might be like. But, you know, just wondering how this new building might impact that one in the space between them and landscaping. I mean, I do see a sidewalk there. So I don't know, maybe if the architect could comment on the design, how the design's incorporated with that building. Yeah, I can speak to that. And we have considered that building with regards to how it sits in the middle of the property. It is rather unique. You're correct. There's basically just apartments on the upper level of that building. As a matter of fact, there's just a total of four units within that building. And we have located the new building as far away from that as we can, while still trying to provide adequate front yard and green space along Mifflin Street. So we're well over 25 feet away from that existing building with this new structure. And we are going to be enhancing the landscaping and providing that pedestrian pathway in between. So we're trying to make it as comfortable as possible for those four units. And so is, are there parking spaces? What's their parking going to be? For that, they would likely utilize any surplus parking that's available for the Avenue building, or potentially if there's any surface parking that's accommodated for the Grass Camp Park through the final design there. Yeah, I can comment on that. We would have them park up front with the 28 unit. And then we actually have three of the four apartments that have been occupied by long-term tenants there don't even have vehicles as well. So, you know, obviously we plan, we hope to stay around for a long time. But if, you know, they do move out someday, we have someone else move in with the vehicle. We have the front parking lot up there. Yeah, I don't, I mean, I would rather not have a parking lot. I'd rather have a bigger park. I don't know if that's important, but also then, so if you're, what is the space? Because I feel like these things change throughout the design process. Like the, the, where you space the building from the sidewalk on like the Mifflin Street side. And then it looks like, I forget, did you have entrances on the second street side? So what's like the setback? Cause I feel like that's something we went back and forth with so many times in the, with the Grass Camp building. Sure. I can speak to the current design and it is not our intention to change it at this point either. Unless we're directed to by zoning or planning staff with the city. But right now we're accommodating a 13 foot setback from the front of the building to the property line. And the sidewalk is just a little bit further than that. So it'll actually feel more than that. And on long second street, we actually have an over an 18 foot setback along this area. Ryan maximize amount of green space available while aligning the driveway across from the second street intersection. And then there's no entrances on the second street side? No, the apartments face either towards the North or up on this or down. So no entrances off the second. Okay. Thanks. Sure. Well, with that, any more questions, comments? Okay. Well, I don't know if the Alder has any concluding remarks, but thanks for being here and patient. I'm sorry again, if there were any technical issues, certainly I don't know what the microphone issue was a few minutes ago, but hopefully everybody got a chance to participate and ask questions, provide comments at this point. So if there aren't any other questions, I will turn it over to Alder Abbas for any concluding remarks. Thank you very much for an opportunity and thank you all of you for attending today's meeting. Really appreciate all the feedback. I absolutely acknowledge the need of the green space, regardless of any project within a district 12. It's really important for us to have from equity standpoint, having space for the kids to play and also having the welcome space. So I really appreciate Natasha, Tessa, Tess and others for expressing your opinion and facts as well. And I also appreciate Lory for thinking creatively how we can move forward with that particular location. So thank you very much for that. And also regarding East Washington and traffic, this is ongoing a situation of crisis actually, if I can put it that way. I reach out to several times to the mayor office, increasing as much pressure as possible. The mayor office, the MPD, traffic engineering, including the orders from downtown, order from near East, East side, six, seven of us was part of a meeting, initial meeting to really discuss about what could be the future plan. It's an unfortunate situation. We have a highway running through the middle of the city, middle of the heart of the city. And we have highway related issues and over speeding and other related issues. And only East Washington redesigning East Washington is not only solution because the cars will go into the neighborhood, into Packard Avenue. So we had an initial discussion about to look holistically, how could we redesign or what could we do? So we're probably going to order as well as city staff going to work in a work group and try to sort out a very complicated situation on East Washington. Unfortunately, I do not have any solution at this moment, which could really satisfy you all, but we are all working and I'm doing all my best to bring your voices on the table, making sure this should stay as a priority. So I know we're talking about this project, but I know we also discuss a lot about traffic. So absolutely work with you, reach out to me if you have any question, any comments, send me an email and I'm always here to answer any question you have. And Nick, regarding question about city zoning, I know I really give you a very brief answer in 10 seconds, but if you, there's more to that. So if you want to reach out, I'm happy to send you the video of that meeting and explain my position in detail. There's a three hour long deliberation, discussion on the common council floor on that. So happy to give more information. So thanks. Thank you all for joining today and thanks for the input. Thank you. Thank you everyone. I appreciate the feedback. Okay.
