============================================================

 Okay, as the time is now, someone might need to turn off their microphone. Okay, let's try this again, perhaps with less feedback. Okay, hi, Tim Parks, planner with the Planning Division, be your moderator for tonight's discussion of the Gorman development at 9301 Crosswinds Lane and the Crosswinds at Hawks Landing Condominium. Just a brief overview of tonight's agenda. I'll give some brief remarks about how to interact with the meeting during or on Zoom. We'll have some welcome comments from Alder Barbara Harrington McKinney, who convened the meeting. I will provide an overview of the approval process. We'll have the development team provide an overview of the project and then we'll conclude with questions, answers and discussion of the project. So, as we get going, you will note that the project, or I'm sorry that this meeting is being recorded. It's going to be posted to the district Alder's webpage one to two days after the meeting so it will be available for anybody who was unable to join us tonight. The meeting is for participants to learn about the proposed development, ask questions and provide feedback. We will open it up for discussion and questions after the overview of the approval process and the developers presentation. We will have one speaker at a time. All speakers will have approximately two minutes to ask questions or make comments and we will try to keep microphones muted until the next speaker is called so that we can avoid feedback which we experienced a little bit of when the meeting was going on. On Zoom, we'll ask folks to keep their microphone muted. When not speaking to avoid the aforementioned background noise or feedback. The moderator will try to keep microphones muted to limit that background noise. Turning off your camera or video when not speaking may help with your screen not freezing. We are going to use the raise hand function in order to call on folks who want to speak. That is located in the reactions box, which is typically found in the lower right hand corner of the zoom window on your computer so reactions and then there's a large button at the bottom of that that says raise hand and that will put you in the queue to be called on if you have a question or would like to make a comment. The chat function is not available for the meeting. In lieu of speaking, you can email comments to myself or to the Alder and we'll have contact information later on in this slide presentation. Everyone will get an opportunity to speak at least once if they would like in order to hear from as many people as time allows preference will be given to those who haven't spoken. If there's anyone joining us by phone for the meeting tonight. The raise hand function is star nine on your mobile device and star six to mute or unmute yourself so star six meter on mute star nine to raise and conversely lower your hand if calling in on the phone. So with that I'll stop there and we'll hear next from Alder Harrington McKinney. Thank you. Thank you very much, Tim and welcome. I am Barbara Harrington McKinney and I was recently reelected to serve as the Alder for district one and it is my pleasure to serve in that position. This evening as Tim has said, it was my honor to convene this session to allow a question and answer in a presentation related to the property that will be discussed this evening. You will be in capable hands with Tim being the facilitator. If you have any questions as Tim has indicated, please email me district one city of Madison dot com or at the end of the presentation Tim will also leave his contact information. Thank you very much for attending this evening and I'll put you back in the hands of Tim Parks. Thank you, Alder. Just a brief overview of the development process for the Gorman project on crosswinds lane and where we are in it. As you see there on the screen we have about an eight step process and we're squarely in the middle of it at this point. Typically there would be pre application notice and discussions for a project. Conrad Gorman is seeking approval to amend the plan development zoning for the crosswinds at Hawks Landing condo project. And that requires ultimately approval by the common council, followed by or preceded by reviews by the Planning Commission and Urban Design Commission. The Urban Design Commission reviewed the project on March 10, and the Planning Commission held an initial public hearing on the project on March 22 before referring it at Alder Harrington McKinney's request in order for there to be more engagement with the community on the project before the Planning Commission acted. So, with that, we'll come back to the process here in a minute but just to let you know on the screen the upcoming hearings for the project. And now we are going to hear from Mr Gorman, if they're present to the group. Go ahead Conrad. Hello. Hi, April. I was hoping I could share the screen, but I'll just give you a little overview about the project. We're looking to build two condominium buildings on Crosswoods Lane in the Hawks Landing neighborhood on the west side of Madison. Originally in 2000 I believe there was approval for the duplexes that are there and five buildings of 16 units apiece in the neighborhood, three of them were completed between 2000 and 2007. The fourth and fifth buildings were not built due to the recession of 2008 and the market after that recession so they have not been built and it's way in the southwest corner of the development is the vacant area that originally had those two units approved for. We're looking to complete those two buildings. There's 16 units apiece. We would build one, you know, as soon as we get approvals and building permits and all that so hopefully we would look mid summer, and the July beginning of August. And then the fifth building we are looking to complete after that's finished and we see how the sales are going. The buildings are in the same footprint as the existing three buildings. They're the same square footage, they're the same physical footprint. We did update the interiors to make as much as much living space for the units as possible. We wanted to open them up a little bit have and really use the golf course views to the north as much as we could so it has quite a bit of glass on the north sides of the building, bigger balconies, trying to use all the square footage available for the units that we can but as I said they're in the exact same footprint as originally approved back in 2000. One change that we are in the process of trying to do is to move the buildings slightly to the west to give a little bit more space in between the existing building number three, and the proposed building number four. The floor plans are there on the screen you can see. Across Winds Lane also we would like to take a little bit to the south to give a little bit of clearance between that building number 30 and the driveway so that garbage trucks and vehicles such as that that might be tall especially have have some room some clearance so that they're not right up against the roof line and the ridge line of that building number 30. So we're looking to move that a little bit to the south and give it a little bit of green space in between building 30 and that other. And as you see, since we talked with the condo association. They gave us some really good feedback and suggestions. One thing I see there is the dog run. We've eliminated that the feedback was that a dog run was not wanted. We have a dog run in the lower left by the circle we're looking to make that a little bit bigger so that there is a turnaround for any delivery parcel delivery vehicles anything like that. We have a list of suggestions and feedback we got from our meeting with Darko and Steve and some other leaders of the condo association. And we've tried to take as many of those into consideration as we possibly can, and I'd be more than happy to share what their concerns were and how we are trying to address as many as we possibly can with anyone that's interested. Justin Marshall with Gorman and company is also in on this call. He's one of the architects on the project and he, I think he has a little bit of something to say about some of the changes we've, we've made after meeting with condo association. Hi everybody, how's it going. I'm with Gorman and company and I'm representing the architectural team. Conrad gave a good summary of everything that we are trying to accomplish, and he's incorrect. We got a bunch of good feedback, both on the interior design the exterior design of these two buildings. If you're interested, we could go through the list, but I think he touched on a couple of the big ones, especially from an exterior perspective, with the dog run being removed with the turnaround on the south end there being enhanced to make traffic flow better. Other random things or smaller things is exterior lighting. We're kind of working on and going to reduce the number of lamp posts that we originally shown, just so that there's not excess light to other buildings in the area, tying into underground storm water drainage to avoid any water issues on site, things of that nature, but we have furthered our design and development, and I think we're headed in a great direction. Conrad if you don't have anything else to share we can maybe jump into the questions and comments portion of the program. And, you know, you can cover anything that you and the condo group discussed during that so if that's if it's okay with everybody will go ahead and just note again the it's around here somewhere there it is. Sorry we're dealing with a small plumbing issue in my house right now as we, as I try to hold the neighborhood meeting so hooray for me. But anyway, the raise hand function again can be found in the reactions box or dialogue box lower right hand corner. If you're on your computer. So again reactions raise hand, or if you're on phone. It's star nine to raise hand and star six to mute or unmute. So, with that, if you would like to ask a question or make a comment, please use the raise hand function, and we'll, we'll get you. Get your mic turned on. This is Richard zero my own mute to my available to speak. Well you didn't raise your hand but since no one else has raised their hand and you unmuted yourself go ahead. Okay, thank you. Well, I do not have a. I have nothing here I where I can raise a hand so I can't see anything I can just see a few pictures that's all. So, one. My wife and I live at 9316 crosswinds Lane. And on record there should be a number of documents that we have sent in pertaining to our condo. We are the very last condo at the end of crosswinds Lane. We are building number 30. Right now, crosswinds Lane ends at our condo. In fact, if you were standing at the corner of our overhang crosswinds Lane asphalt is right there. And that's the reason why we are so concerned about the safety issue of our building with this project. When we right now we have no space provided, and that's why we're looking for. I had at one time requested 27 feet, which goes out to the fire hydrant if you look on the site plan there was a fire hydrant that six right off the end of our condo. That's 25 feet from our house. And what I'm requesting is that if you put the road going into building number five at 27 feet, you would provide a green space between our building and the access road that goes into building number five. That's our first issue. And that's our big concern. We have no safety on the driveway side. And we are looking to for a green space to separate any driveways going into building number five, and where we live. That's our, that's our first issue. And if I, is it okay to go on just for our second issue. I guess I'll go ahead. Yeah, the other issue is in relationship to crosswinds Lane. Crosswinds Lane is nothing more than a lane or a fire lane that comes in. It's not designed for a lot of traffic. Right now there are just two duplex buildings that use crosswinds Lane. And for traffic today, anyone coming in, does one of two things, either. And these are cars, trucks, garbage trucks. They either back all the way out crosswinds Lane, out to the beginning, or they have to find a way to turn around and in many cases it's our driveway, which is at the end of crosswinds Lane. And this is a big safety issue, trucks turning around cars turning around. And this is why we're requesting that there be a cul-de-sac put on crosswinds Lane, preferably between buildings four and five. And if you look at the site plan, it looks like there would be room to bring in crosswinds Lane, put in a cul-de-sac and then cars and trucks could come in, turn around, turn and go back out crosswinds Lane. And if with the addition of curbs and gutters, that would also help control water and keep cars and vehicles on the lane. Right now there are no curbs and gutters so people can drive wherever they want. So what's going to keep 64 cars, because that's what your parking garage is going to have 64 cars on crosswinds Lane. What's going to keep the garbage truck that comes in, I believe twice a week to these buildings on cross crosswinds Lane. What's going to keep service vehicles that come into service these buildings for electrical or whatever gas company there. And there is nothing to provide a turnaround. And this is going to be a safety factor and it's going to be ongoing. And this is something that needs to be addressed today and not letting it go and say, oh, let's see what happens later on. These are our two main issues. So I have some other comments, but I'm sure maybe somebody else wants to have something to say. Anyone from the project team want to respond to that or how would you like to manage these comments? Yeah, Richard, we're working with the civil engineer to try to get green space in between your building and the driveway into building five. And really, it is only going to be eight units of parking that use that that last driveway. It's there's 16 spots, eight units. The turnaround and service vehicles and everything like that should be using the surface parking to the south of the building. They don't normally have access to the resident parking that's designated underneath there. I totally understand your concerns with with the garbage trucks and things like that. And that's why we're working with civil engineering to try to get as much try to get that green space. And we're really trying to make sure that there's that space in between your roof line, your home and that driveway. But as far as turnaround and everything, the service vehicles and guest parking and everything like that should all be on the opposite side of the building from from your home. Really, the only vehicles that should be crossing are for the eight units in the one parking, the one designated parking door by the resident parking. The one designated parking door by your home. But that doesn't take that doesn't really get rid of anything as far as the garbage trucks that come in. And we see Madison gas and electric vehicles coming into the other high rise condos all the time. There are service vehicles that come in underneath. They're always parked up there doing something on the buildings. So there's nothing. You know, I hear what you're saying. But at the same time, for the safety of of the traffic, a turnaround provides a way for people to get out. And they're going to people people don't always know which side of the building they're supposed to go on. I think that's something that's been brought up a number of times in previous meetings is that people don't know if the front entrance is on the north side or is it on the south side? And they pull down these lanes in this lane is not designed for a lot of traffic. When you talk about even 64 cars, yes, on the very end garage, but you've got four entrances coming into two buildings. Where are all these cars going to go? The road is not wide enough. It's hardly wide enough for two cars to pass right now. So some planning needs to be put into expanding crosswinds lane, giving it a turnaround and providing some protection from the duplex owners on the one side in the two story buildings or the multi story buildings on the south side. Okay, at this point, we're going to pause on Mr. Zier. I'm sure we'll have an opportunity to hear from him again as we go along. But we have three other folks who are in the queue to ask questions. So we'll hear next from David Hewitt to be followed by Stephen Anderson and Darko Kalan. So you should have a prompt to unmute Mr. Hewitt. Okay, I think I did unmute everyone here. Yes, we can hear you fine. Okay, great. First of all, the little blue card that we received refers to perch properties. Is that basically Gorman Construction? Perch properties is my real estate team. I'm working with Gorman and Company on this project, but I'm not an employee for Gorman and Company. I'm working with them on this project. So that is my real estate team. Now, I understand that there was an agreement signed between Crosswinds Association and Gorman in 2013, limiting our ability to raise concerns and objections about this project. Is that still in effect in your eyes? I am not aware of that. If I could get any details or a copy of that, I'd really appreciate that. I wasn't aware of that. It does spell out also the timeframe for bringing the new developments into or the new condos into our association. And I'm wondering if that has been at all considered by you and the board. I'm not on the board. So I'm just wondering where all that is. Steve Anderson and I have discussed it. We're still in the fact finding of the actual logistics of how a merger would happen and who's going to be paying for a certain upkeep and stuff during construction. So I'm working with some people at Gorman and Company as well. And we're working on what the exact merger process of the new owners with the existing condo association is going to be. Have you coordinated how information about, say, the our HOA's bylaws and everything that goes along with the sale of a condominium to a new buyer, how that would be transferred to the potential buyers? Because if they're not part of an association, I don't know that our association would be obligated to provide that information in such a sale if it's not connected already to the association. I know our hope and intention is for the new buildings to be an equal part of the association with the existing buildings. You know, like I said, we still have some work to do to find exactly the exact process of how that's going to happen. But the full intention, at least on our side, is to have the new owners be part of the association with you all. Mm hmm. I just think some of that needs to be clarified going forward so that you know exactly how it's going to happen. And so it's done on an amicable and reasonable basis. Definitely. Okay. I think that's all I have. Thank you. Thank you. All right. We'll hear next from Steve Anderson, followed by Darko Kalan. Yeah, good evening. I got a few questions here. One is, you know, Conrad, we're hoping to see that revised site plan, you know, the board. I know what you were hearing what you're saying, but it's kind of hard for me, especially to kind of visualize what you know what it's all going to might look like, you know, and that we can get measurements and whatnot that it may help solve resolve some of those questions like, you know, Mr. Mr. Ziras and the rest of us, but I know it takes some time to do, but I'm worried about the May 24 deadline here for the Planning Commission. And, and so we haven't seen anything here. So it's, you know, you can hear our concerns yet about some of these things. And then if we need to change some more, then it's going to delay it even more. So I don't know if we can, if some of this, if we're going to have a problem, you know, trying to get it all done before the May 24th Planning Commission meeting. And then, and then as an association, we're worried about, well, what, how is the merger going to take place? Because, you know, then, like you mentioned earlier, the shared costs of everything, you know, once this starts being built and then, and then, then at what point will, you know, you be coming to us to the meeting? Will you be coming to us to say, you know, will you take it over now? So we're kind of concerned and, you know, up in the air as to how that's going to work out. But the other question I had was, is the 24th going to be a hearing where we, if we need to come and make comments, or is it going to be not a hearing and open for public comment? You know, I guess that was the other question I had. I know the April 1 was not going to be open for discussion the way I understood it from, I think Tim might have told me that, but I'm just wondering, you know, if that's what, how the 24th is going to be handled. But anyway, it would help. And then are you going to be open for any more suggestions on things? You know, I thought of a few others that I don't know from looking at the, might involve interior. They're more minor, the more the, you can hear that the more major ones deal with the outside and exactly how water drainage is going to be handled, the traffic controlled, crosswinds lane, you know, how we're going to deal with that. So those naturally are the major ones, but then there's a few smaller ones that just was wondering how you were considering those. But anyway, so that's, that's what I had at this point to ask. Why don't I, this is Tim Parks. Why don't I jump in with the procedural stuff first? I didn't get an opportunity to really go into this in great detail. At the start of the meeting, trying to juggle a call to a plumber in the process is there will be a public hearing where there is scheduled to be a public hearing at the May 24th planning commission meeting. We have noticed the new public hearing and postcards will be mailed by tomorrow in advance of that May 24th meeting. So folks who wish to address the planning commission about the crosswinds lane project will have the opportunity to do so. That was not the case with the, I believe April 26th meeting date. We specifically noticed the new public hearing recognizing that we're going to have this discussion tonight and wanting to give the applicant members of the public the opportunity to address the planning commission after that, or after the discussion tonight. So the May 24th meeting will be a public hearing. It will be a virtual meeting held on Zoom. And you can register online. The registration for the May 24th planning commission meeting will be open sometime next Thursday afternoon. So one week from today. From a procedural standpoint, the planning commission makes a recommendation on all rezoning the request to amend the plan development zoning district effectively to give it a new lease on life, because it was originally approved in 2001 the whole crosswinds project, all of the duplexes. All five of the four story 16 unit buildings were approved in 2001 but there's a provision in the zoning code that says that if you have not implemented your general development plan, which is sort of like the higher level concept plan for a plan development zoning district, which is followed by a specific implementation plan which as its name suggests is the very detailed final plans of what will actually get built, where and how, if you don't implement your approved general development plan or if you change the phasing of your general development plan. You have to come back after 10 years and seek a new approval from the common council following review by the city's urban design commission and plan commission is noted on the screen the urban design commission reviewed the, the new or reborn reestablished general general development plan and specific implementation plan on March 10, but the planning commission meeting that discussion was referred from March 22 to now may 24. Following May 24, the common council is scheduled to hear it on June 1. Like most projects in the city if it's approved, it will be approved with conditions and the applicant will have to meet those conditions before permits would be issued and construction can begin. So we're on the red highlighted number five step with three fairly consequential steps to follow it afterwards and otherwise I'll give the floor back to Conrad to see if he wants to address some of the other comments that Mr. Anderson made in his questions and comments. Sure. Yeah, Steve, I'll, I'll talk to our civil engineering and and maybe Justin can probably help me with it tomorrow and we'll try to get you, at least get you a time frame of when we'll be able to get that site plan to you guys, I'm going to try to get it as soon as possible reflecting those changes. I've spoken with an attorney that drafts mergers like this so he's giving me kind of a rundown of the procedural stuff that needs to happen I would love to go over that with you. And I'm still just in some discussions with with Gorman and company about how they've handled some of those mergers in the past they really haven't done condos and several years they're more apartments, these days so. Yeah, but, um, yeah, I'd love to continue that discussion. And then, of course, we definitely are open to more suggestions you know the feedback that we got from you guys in our first meeting. Yeah, that's extremely valuable, and just things that you as a resident, know and you know can think of that is hard visualizing it sometimes to think of some of those details you know the spigots for for cleaning the main lobby floors and stuff like that are just one of the things that I would love to hear from you guys. Yeah, I think that's a great example lighting in the parking lots things like that are really great feedback and yeah, more than welcome I very much appreciate any anything like that from from you as well as the other residents. Okay, I appreciate that. We're going to answer questions by Stephen here in a little bit. But we'll hear next from Darko Kalan to be followed by Mary Euler. Hi, this is Darko Kalan, and one of the big issues as you recall our first meeting and are actually our only meeting was the again crosswinds lane. And one of the things that we specified as Rich pointed out, Richard pointed out that was the cul-de-sac but the second thing was the need for crosswinds lane in each in that area as well as curves and gutters crosswinds lane as it as it extends right now down to whistling lane is all is all curved and gutted all the way. This little segment that goes to the other two building four and five. You decided not to put curves and gutters there because apparently costs are an issue. So the 64 cars plus the two duplexes that are on the side, plus the amount of traffic that will be going into those garages. I think it's imperative that curves and gutters be provided. The reason being is that Gorman years ago when they developed the the site here left whistling lane, excuse me, left memory doesn't serve me right but three roads whistling and not whistling but windy, windy court, gusty court and without curves. We now face which would fairly significant costs every year because the plows are heading the grass and plowing up the grass. So, as an association, we have to pay to have all that repaired because nobody bothered to put in the curb and gutters. So I think it's imperative, especially on the road that for that you guys are going to be building that that be done. And the second thing is that the garbage trucks that are going in. These are large large trucks. And when they go in, they go in front end first because they're front end load. When they come out, they have no way of turning. They have to back out on that road. I think and according and I believe Richard's right, there is a good chance that those trucks there. They're very large trucks could hit his condominium. And because of that, I think it's imperative that you guys take a second look at that. And really I'm speaking strictly from an association standpoint. That, that's all I have. Thank you. This is a 10 parks I wanted to kind of jump in on that. At that point, the crosswinds development was only approved to have curb and gutter on the main section of crosswinds lane and whistling lane gusty cord. High wind cord, breezy lane. Most of those were approved without curb and gutter. And I think that's a really good example of a kind of unique condition that you have out in crosswinds, where you can have streets that are not improved to a higher, I would submit public standard and have a building placement where you have units like the building 30 that is placed as close to crosswinds lane as it is. So from the city's perspective, the project will have to meet the city's requirements for stormwater management, erosion control stormwater management plan, things of that nature. That is accomplished for this small corner of crosswinds that's unfinished will be approved by the city engineering division. The report that was issued for the March 22 plan commission meeting, which at this point is the report of record for Conrad Gorman's project has a number of comments related to stormwater management. It does not itself specify that curb and gutter have to be added and likewise the traffic engineers is not requiring curb on those private roads, because they're effectively by virtue of the plan development zoning allowed to be built to a lesser, looser, perhaps more rustic standard than you would have in other developments. So, just, you know, as a point of order on that just that, you know, that's how the crosswinds project was originally presented and approved in 2001. And so the condition that is out there throughout the development, but particularly in this unfinished corner of it is the condition that was established initially with the project. So basically, it would be our cost the association so the 110 people that live here without to pay for that. That's what they want. That what you're telling me. Well, I just would like to point out that the condition that the association is is tasked with with maintaining is a condition that was originally established with the approval of the project in 2001 before any of the units were built. And so, from the standpoint that it may make sense for for Mr Gorman to add curves to crosswinds lane because it helps him better maintain stormwater or control. You know, traffic flow on that that low density roadway section. That's certainly an option that, you know, especially in order to satisfy the stormwater management requirements. That's an option that's available to them. At this point, city agencies are not requiring it because they these are private roads, and there may be other ways, particularly related to stormwater management, where, you know, stormwater can be managed without curbing gutter, but that's obviously something that if the association wants to work with Mr Gorman to include. That's that's something that's going to be potentially beyond the city's ability to control. I understand. Right with that. We are going to go next to Mary Euler, who will be followed by David Hewitt and then Richard zero. Mary you are unmuted. Go ahead. Okay, I have to, I submitted a few questions and one of mine ahead of time was will crosswinds lane be widened or rebuilt. And I think that kind of comes into I agree totally with Richard and Darko that when you look at the buildings, the other three buildings Up on crosswinds lane. They have curb and gutter and we're going to be getting two thirds of the traffic at least you know with all the people living there. And we live right next to Richard and Joan, and then there are two other condos in the on crosswinds to. So it's really four different. It's two buildings but four different owners that live here. And I'm concerned about even where the construction vehicles will enter and park during construction and And, and also once the buildings are built, how will visitors enter and where will they park. We assume you know the residents will enter with their parking garages on crosswinds lane, but I guess there isn't going to be anything coming in on on the other side from midtown, or maybe I'm wrong. Because midtown is on the other side there. So I don't know. I, you know, and I didn't see this drawing before I had my questions. So, so I guess I kind of have a few of them there. Yeah, so, um, I mean, I, the visitor parking, as you can see there we were planning as there's 13 additional spots and and a turnaround there on the south side of the building. As far as construction, parking and construction access I don't Darko that was a big point that he had during our meeting was that they did not want construction parking or construction equipment on the association road so we will be having that off of midtown. So we're not going to have parking for construction workers or construction equipment, being on crosswinds lane and part of the thing when I was talking to other people were working on this project with especially the construction budget person. You know that that we are not going to be using these roads we're not going to tear them up, you know, any, if we do have to, you know, get into utilities or stormwater or anything we will definitely 100% return them to their condition repair them to their condition. But it's just there's, it's, it's frankly just not affordable for us to completely redesign rebuild put curves and gutters on on roads that were not going to be using for the construction and maintaining an affordable price on these units. You know, we'd love to work with you guys on on, you know, something that would would work great for you guys but you know as far as, you know, we're not using we're not parking on on those roads to have us completely replace redesign reengineering redo them. It's, it's going to be extremely extremely hard if not impossible while maintaining any kind of affordability of these these units. And just, we have on the screen right now this is the proposed plan for the two four story 16 unit buildings total of 32 units. Just for comparison sake. This is a close up view of the 2001 specific implementation plan, which shows the building 30 place very close across Winslain. As it was built. I confirm that just now during the meeting that in fact, building 30 is as close to crosswinds lane as it was approved to be. And so, you know, if there's any sort of rejiggering of crosswinds lane to create more space between buildings five and 30. We will need to see that on Conrad's plans that are that go before the plan commission. And just, you know, again to compare and contrast. It's a little faint up in the upper left hand corner of the picture but this is building 30, which the outlines of it are very faint and I apologize it's the best image we have tonight. It shows that really close relationship between that building and crosswinds lane and the setback between building five and crosswinds lane which if Conrad is going to slide crosswinds down a little bit to create a little more space. It will, it'll probably be an improvement over the condition that was originally approved for this portion of the site back in 2001. So, Mary, did you have another comment or question? Well, I'm just kind of surprised that they approved that back in 2001 with that amount of space between those big buildings and crosswinds lane really. It's not at all like it is up above on the other three buildings so it's just kind of surprising that they did that. I don't know if they're really thinking what this really looked like, you know. I'm looking out there right now at those buildings that are the tall buildings, and we're going to have two more. And yet, we won't have the road that they have by the other three big ones. So it's like, I don't, it's like a little path for these two, and a nice street for the other ones. It just doesn't make any sense. Maybe I'm missing something but I'm not an architect or anything but my husband sitting here and he had a tooth pull today so we can't talk very well. But anyway, that's my view as just an ordinary citizen and kind of looking out there and not quite understanding what they approved. Okay. Thank you for those, those comments. We'll move next to David Hewitt. Go ahead, Mr. Hewitt. Okay, great. I just had one follow up. Well, I'm going to make a point. Mr. Gorman, given the, given the demand for condo properties, I don't think your expenses that you may incur will cut too much into your profit margin so you know, come on. So, but I do have a serious question. In the court in the southwest corner, very close to building five. There is a weather siren. And it is loud. Every first Wednesday of every month. And it casts us out and we're, you know, four blocks away. And I'm wondering if you will work with the city to have that move would you incur the expense if in fact it's determined that you need to move that siren. Because of its. I mean it's going to be within what 200 feet of that building and I can tell you from half a mile away that siren is deafening. So I'm just wondering if that is taken into account. And would you and the city work that through to make sure that it's properly placed for building five. I'll just quickly comment on that that the siren is in Kingswood Park, adjacent to the crosswinds development, it's not actually on the crosswinds development so I know I understand that, but it proximity to the, it will blast those people out in building five. But there, there are not currently any discussions about moving the emergency alert siren. That's there. And that siren is in very close proximity to a great many dwelling units. And it's right there with its location adjacent to Midtown Road, and the development, really, to the south and east. It, it would be very unlikely however that anybody in building five whatever be able to say that they didn't hear that there was a tornado. Because it certainly will be close but I would say that the city was aware of the future development of this parcel. I think that's the one that that siren was placed. And I can think of the one that's on the other side of pleasant few road, kind of sitting I believe right in the middle of Midtown Road, which is likewise and in very close proximity to dwelling units in the southern And I'm just telling you, you know, just, you know, when you go to sell these units. That's something you may want to have to point out to potential buyers. All right. Thank you, Mr. Hewitt. We'll hear next from Richard's ear. And then we have Stephen Anderson back in the queue again. Yes, thank you. After listening to a number of things that have been discussed tonight there are a couple other things that might be appropriate. I think the aspect that we talked about crosswinds lane. We're talking about the cost. We're also talking about, you know, the use of it. And there's a thing about the selling factor of the buildings to the new for the new for the two new buildings. I mean, if people are going to buy these condos for whatever amount of money, and the area, the roads going into where they live are not kept in good condition, and they aren't adequate for getting in and out of the building. That could be looked at as a detriment to why would I want to buy a bit by a condo in one of these buildings. So that's just one aspect. And I think that's something that should be considered seriously. Another thing is that we're hearing that plans were approved in 2001. That's 20 years ago, 21 years ago, and times have changed building codes have changed. The use of land has changed. The whole concept of how much water we get when it rains I mean we all like to have we need moisture, but sometimes when we get rain. We get tons of rain. And a lot of times, we're relying on engineers who say well this is an adequate amount of drainage to take the stormwater from a building from a driveway from a road and funnel it someplace, but that's for an average amount of rain in a normal rainfall. What's going to happen when we get the rain which we had a couple years ago they talk about it as like, you know, 50 year amount of rain well we get those pretty often lately. And that's a lot of water, and where is it going to go. And you look at the whole Madison area, where they're adding roads that have gone into plans that have been there for years. And they aren't using the old plans. They're looking at new plans. They're looking at redesigning they're putting in water retention pots. They're putting in basins, so that the water can be funneled into something before it goes all over the place and floods parking garages how many times have we heard with parking garages have been flooded because they go down into the ground. The water comes down we had so much rain, and where's it going to go it goes to the lowest point, it floods the parking garages. So, when you look at these buildings we're talking about 30 feet apart. A large building we're talking about four driveways going in the backside, the north side. We're talking about a big roundabout up in the front. Where's this going to go. And I'm really surprised that the Planning Commission hasn't looked at putting in one building. Just one building you build building number four. You space it in the property that is there. And then providing the water retention bonds or basins or whatever you want to call them. Because with the two buildings that are proposed. There's only 15 feet on the west side of the building to the property line. And they're talking about roughly, I think it's 3033 feet between the buildings. There isn't much ground that's left, that's not going to be building asphalt driveways. So, in the, in the world that we live in today, you can come right over here on Midtown Road and you see water retention ponds all over. You go in a number of places in Madison. They are scrambling to come up with ways to put in water retention ponds or basins for the runoff that comes from the streets because we funnel everything from the streets into something, but there's no place for the water to go. And my comment is, why not take and put one building in instead of two and design this properly so that for the future, we don't have problems to deal with. That's my other comment. Thank you. Thank you. Next we'll hear from Stephen Anderson, and after Mr. Anderson there's nobody in the queue so if there's a question or comment that someone would like to make. Now would be the time to use the raise hand function, star nine on your mobile device and raise hand in the reactions feature in the lower right hand corner. Go ahead, Mr. Anderson. Thank you. I'm sort of piggybacking on what Richard said regarding, you know, the times have changed. The comments about, you know, this goes back to crosswinds lane about, you know, how it should, you know, maybe should be widened in that, you know, back 20 years or when this was approved. We didn't have things like Amazon Prime FedEx ups meals being delivered to all the houses. And then with the pandemic that's even increased. And so we have, you wouldn't believe the amount of traffic and we have on our property delivering packages every day, multiple times a day, Saturdays and Sundays. And these trucks are, you know, and they go fast because they're on a schedule. And so, and so we have these narrow little courts that you know Darko was mentioning with tailwind, gusty, and windy court and in this part of crosswinds. And so people might have visitors and they have cars parked on the on those little streets because they can't fit in the driveways. So now you have these other trucks coming and trying to get in. And there's not a lot of room they end up driving on the grass. So, this, this thing about it, it was acceptable 20 years ago, you know, to me it's got it, we got to be looking at the future here it's changed. And, and so yeah, we can't do anything with these other courts now but here we have a chance of maybe correcting a problem on on crosswinds lane. And I know I can understand the money, you know, the budget and all that but you know we're going to have to live with this once it's done. And if it's going to be merged into the association and our owners are going to have to deal with it so now is the time we feel that we need to get it up front and addressed as much as possible. So anyway, so that's all I have to say is that, you know, we're in 2021 now we're not in 2000 anymore and and so we really need to address some of these things. Okay, thank you for that. It looks like Mr. Gorman has his hand up to potentially reply so why don't we go ahead and do that and then we'll be back to Mr. Zier, I also see that Justin Marshall with Gorman had his hand raised so between Conrad and Justin maybe they want to provide some feedback. Yeah, Richard I totally get the water issue in 2018 I had over 12 inches of water in my yard so I definitely understand, understand the concern. I, you know, a lot of the footprint and a lot of the plans were from 2001 but the, the stormwater management, the engineering, that civil engineer working on that and the codes and everything for the stormwater is current, it's not 2001. And there have been many updates and things since then. You're right there are two big buildings but even with that lot coverage is 28.7% of the lot is covered. You know we're trying to make sure that all the parking parking lot anything paved all the downspouts and everything, nothing gets is going on the ground that all of it is being handled in an efficient way with stormwater management. So, they know a lot more than me and I can prove, I can provide you the, the stormwater drawings and things like that. But it's definitely being highly can considered and it's the, as far as the water, it's not just going on what they would have done in 2001. I would just like to reply to Mr Anderson's concerns. I think what we need to remember is that the building face is that are looking at crosswinds lanes are really almost a back of house that's a residence only. When it comes to things like deliveries Amazon Prime ups, all of that. That will be happening on the other side of the building through the guest parking area. That's where the front doors of these buildings face. And that's where all the mailboxes mail slots things of that nature are oriented. So they'll be directed to go to that side of the building so you won't see any of that on that side of the building. And then if you're looking at things like things like Amazon Prime food delivery anything like that. You'll just have resident parking, and then garbage pickup and delivery on this side of the building. So, looks like Mr Anderson has muted himself so we'll take him out of the queue, and we'll hear next from Mr Zier but, you know, what probably time to make last call for comments or questions for the meeting. So, if you want to jump in, raise your hand, and we'll go to you. Otherwise, we'll start to bring the meeting to a close here. So, back to Mr Zier. Yes, thank you. My final comments are this. Before anything is approved for these buildings. I think there are a number of issues that should be resolved. And I feel very uncomfortable with the idea that, well, we're looking into it, or it'll be taken care of, we'll see what we can do, or we'll come up with a solution as it appears as it arrives as we go along here. And I think for the safety of my family, where we live in this building. I'm so close to the driveways that are going to go into building number five. I simply asked that something be put in writing and be resolved before this project is approved. Because I don't feel comfortable in leaving things. Just sit out there and say well we'll work it out, we'll see what's going to happen. Myself, my wife, our grandchildren. It's our safety that's involved here. We live right next to this thing. And once it's there, we can't do anything about it. And that's why we're looking for the safety zone and open grass area down the side of our property. And I'm even willing to have our driveway changed so we'll come in on the side so that we have a driveway. We don't have to worry about some truck or someone coming in to drop off whatever they would be dropping off in those buildings and using our driveway to turn around and swing into our driveway. Which goes back to the thing about the cul-de-sac. But this is something that has to be worked out, I think, in advance. And I'm just looking for everyone to kind of come together and come up with some solutions for the overall layout of the geography of this project. So thank you very much for listening to my comments this evening. All right. Thank you. We don't have anybody else left in the queue. I am going to call up some information. As we begin to conclude the meeting. Noting again that the Plan Commission is scheduled to hear the plans that were submitted in January. On May 24th at 530. That'll be a virtual meeting. Information for where to find the city. The meeting schedule is there at the bottom of the slide. An opportunity for you to see the agenda, register if you're interested in registering on the project. Including if you wish to speak. Likewise, the project is currently scheduled for the June 1st Common Council hearing at 645. That will also be a virtual meeting. Comments for folks wishing to make comments about the project at this point. Because we have an application pending before the Planning Commission recommends that the PC comments at cityofmadison.com The city of Madison.com. PC comments at cityofmadison.com. District one. The word district. The city of Madison.com. And either way we will get those written comments to the Plan Commission. Comments should be received by 3 p.m. on May 24th. If you would like them to be presented to the Planning Commission. We can't guarantee that comments received after 3 p.m. will be received in time. I will be reviewing the plan and the plans. I will be reviewing the plans. If there are changes in the plans. As Conrad Alman alluded to. That may affect the schedule. Certain changes may require agencies to review and comment on. So I will throw that out there. But at this point we are scheduling a new public hearing. The first card should be received on that at the beginning of next week. And there is the contact information. It sounds like Alder Harrington McKinney would like to offer some comments. Go ahead Alder. Yes, thank you very much. I would like to offer some comments. I want to first thank everyone who participated. I would like to thank everyone who participated this evening. And to remind the participants that this session was recorded. And I was making some notes myself. And I will be sitting with Tim. And also with Conrad. And to talk about what came up in these meetings. And then some kind of answer. Not some kind. I would like to remind everyone that we will review tonight's session together. And we will go through those questions and see what's workable and what's not. And make sure that that gets back to you before the. The. I would like to remind you that the public comments that you would like to make to the planning commission will be open and available at that 24th. And again, thank you very much for coming and expressing your concerns. And just know that we will have a conversation about them. And determine what's so and what's not so. Thank you for those comments, Alder. And just again, as we close, thank you for attending. And that information on how to comment on the plans that are pending before the planning commission on May 24th. That information is on the screen. With that, we're going to say good night. And if there are any additional questions, please feel free to email at the addresses that you see there. Thank you very much again for attending, everyone.
